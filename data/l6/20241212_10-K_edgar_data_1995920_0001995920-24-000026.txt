OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We have no
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company
currently has loses and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs
over an extended period of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses
The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s
efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and
continue as a going concern. 

The accompanying condensed financial statements have
been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at August 31, 2024. and for the related periods
presented. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. These estimates and
assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature
of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our
financial statements. 

7 

Use of
Estimates 

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments. 

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not applicable
to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

The Company s
Financial Statements required by Item 8, together with the reports thereon of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm are set
forth on pages F-1 through F-11 of this report and are incorporated by reference in this Item 8. 

Item 9.
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures 

(a) Dismissal
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

On October
15, 2024, our Board of Directors approved the dismissal of Olayinka Oyebola Co. (the "Former Auditor") as the Registrant's
independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately. 

The reports
of the Former Auditor on the Company s financial statements for the period from June 6, 2023 (inception) through May 31, 2024 did
not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
principles except that the report contained an explanatory paragraph stating that there was substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. During the period September 5, 2023, the date of our engagement with Former Auditor, and October
15, 2024, the date of dismissal, the Company did not experience any disagreements, as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation
S-K, between itself and Former Auditor on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Former Auditor s satisfaction, would have caused Former Auditor to make
reference to such disagreements in its audit reports. During the period June 6, 2023 (inception) through the date of the Former Auditor s
termination on October 15, 2024, there were no reportable events (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 

The Company
provided Former Auditor with a copy of the above disclosures and requested that Former Auditor provide the Company with a letter addressed
to the SEC stating whether or not it agrees with the statements made above. A copy of Former Auditor s letter dated October 16,
2024 was furnished as Exhibit 16.1 to the current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC by the Company on October 16, 2024. 

(b) Appointment
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

On October
16, 2024, our Board of Directors approved the appointment of Victor Mokuolu CPA PLLC, as the Company's new independent registered public
accounting firm for the year ended August 31, 2024. 

During the
Company s fiscal years ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, and the subsequent interim period through the date of this report,
neither the Company, nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with Victor Mokuolu CPA PLLC regarding either (i) the application of accounting
principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed , or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect
to the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and no written report or oral advice was provided to the Company by Victor Mokuolu
CPA PLLC, that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting
issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a "disagreement" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the
related instructions) or a reportable event (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. Our management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures,
which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. 

Our management,
with the participation of our CEO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as
of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is described
below. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management
and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Our internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our
financial statements. 

A material
weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, the Company
determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

Corporate governance - Key management personnel of the Company and members
on the Board of Directors are the same. Functional responsibilities under corporate governance are performed by a director, who is also
the Company's Chief Executive Officer. There is no audit committee. Consequently, these factors result in ineffective oversight in the
establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, resulting in inadequate evaluation of the application of accounting
principles and disclosures. Additionally, there is significant risk of management override of controls. 

Absence of audit committee and internal audit function results in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, resulting in inadequate evaluation of the
application of accounting principles and disclosures. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee and
does not include a member that is independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 

9 

Policies
and procedures 

Risk Assessment - not having a sufficiently documented risk assessment process
to identify and analyze risks of misstatement due to error and/or fraud, and not having sufficiently documented compliance communication
and investigation policies. 

Lack of formal policies and procedures results in ineffective controls over
routine accounting transactions processing and financial reporting. 

 Accounting,
Financial Close and Reporting 

The Company does not have enough skilled accounting resources supporting
the financial close and reporting processes to ensure (i) changes and entry to spreadsheets utilized in the financial reporting process
were properly reviewed, (ii) significant estimates and judgments were adequately supported, reviewed, approved and evaluated against actual
experiences, (iii) effective and timely analysis and reconciliation of significant accounts, and (iv) a proper review of period close
entries and procedures. 

Failure to properly design financial closing and reporting process to record,
review, and monitor compliance with generally accepted accounting principles for transactions on a timely basis. 

Inadequate Internal Controls: The Company has only one member of management
who is also the Company s sole director, therefore the Company lacks adequate segregation of duties. 

Inadequate IT Controls: As of August 31, 2024, the Company retains copies
of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s
data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

As a result
of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO in 2013. 

\ 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were
no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2024, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 E-Smart Corp 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
E-Smart Corp. the Company as of August 31, 2024, and August 31, 2023, and the related statements of operations, changes
in stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows, for the 12 months ended August 31, 2024 and the period from inception (June 6, 2023)
to August 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2024, and the period from inception (June
6, 2023) to August 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 12 months ended August 31, 2024, and the period
from inception (June 6, 2023) to August 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, the Company is currently
experiencing losses and has not yet secured a stable revenue stream to cover its operating costs over a prolonged period. These factors
raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that:
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters . 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2024.

Valuation allowance 

Net deferred tax assets

 - 

The ultimate realization of deferred
income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and
tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty
exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance
as of August 31, 2024. All tax years since inception remain open for examination by taxing authorities. 

F-9 

The related deferred tax benefit
on the above unutilized tax losses has a full valuation allowance not recognized against it as there is no certainty of its realization.
Management has evaluated tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 and has not identified any significant tax positions, other than those
disclosed. 

The actual tax benefit at the
expected rate of 21 differs from the expected tax benefit for the year ended August 31, 2024 as follows: 

Year ended 
 August 31, 2024
