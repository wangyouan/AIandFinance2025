Introduction 

We
were incorporated in the Cayman Islands on August 18, 2022 as an exempted company with limited liability, under the name Protopia
Global Holdings Inc. We conduct our operations in Hong Kong primarily through our operating subsidiary in Hong Kong. We filed an initial
registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission on January 20,
2023, which became effective on May 12, 2023 (as amended as of May 12, 2023, the Registration Statement ), pursuant
to which up to 1,000,000 of our ordinary shares, par value 0.00001 per share (each, an Ordinary Share , collectively, Ordinary
Shares became registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act in a self-underwritten
best-efforts public offering (the Public Offering ). 

The
Ordinary Shares were, and continue to be, offered at the fixed price of 0.50 per share. The self-underwritten best-efforts Public Offering
will terminate on the earliest of (i) 180 days following the effective date of the Registration Statement, or November 8, 2023,
(ii) the date on which the offering is fully subscribed, and (ii) the date which management determines to terminate the offering. 

As
of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no Ordinary Shares have been sold in the Public Offering. 

Corporate
Structure 

The Company is the 100 owner of Protopia International
Company Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong on August 26, 2022. 

Exempted
companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying
with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the
Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2020 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for
a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on
profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income,
gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares,
debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution
of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation
of us. 

Business
Development 

We have generated Nil service income and have
accumulated losses in the amount of 124,751 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. We have never been party to any bankruptcy, receivership
or similar proceeding, nor have we undergone any material reclassification, merger, consolidation, or purchase or sale of a significant
amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business. 

Since
the date of incorporation to June 30, 2024, our efforts had been devoted primarily to startup and development activities, which
include the following: 

1. Formation
of the Company and obtaining start-up capital; 

2. Developing
our services; 

3. Identifying
possible commercial alliances in the marketplace; and 

4. Actively
seeking to secure clients to use our services. 

1 

Business
of the Company 

Principal
Services and Principal Markets 

We
assist small- and medium-sized non-U.S. companies in accessing international capital markets through listings on U.S. nationally recognized
stock exchanges such as the Nasdaq Global Market, the Nasdaq Capital Market and NYSE American or quotation by the OTC Markets Group (OTCQX,
OTCQB and Pink). We are offering our services to clients with operations in Hong Kong presently, and we intend to expand the distribution
of our services into China as opportunities permit. We facilitate this goal by acting as a project manager to provide consulting, liaison
and coordination services to non-U.S. companies. In addition, after our clients become publicly traded companies, we will provide them
with continuing consulting services related to maintaining compliance with the requirements of pertinent jurisdictions and regulatory
agencies. Such consulting, liaison and coordination services that we intend to provide include or address, without exclusivity, the following: 

1. Organizing
and incorporating client companies outside of the United States; 

2. Development
and preparation of business and operational plans; 

3. Providing
forms of legal documents for further review and preparation by licensed attorneys engaged by a client; 

4. Establishing
accounting control systems; 

5. Referring
clients to independent accounting firms; 

6. Referring
clients to independent third-party legal and other professional services firms; 

7. Acting
as the intermediary for the flow of information and documentation between clients and professional services firms; and 

8. Other
general advisory services, as required or requested by clients. 

When
our clients engage us to provide our advisory services in connection with the process of the initial listing of their securities in the
U.S., we provide our business advice related to the initial eligibility requirements and evaluate such client s proposed business
plan and discuss proposed recommendations to that business plan. 

We
do not have pre-arranged agreements with any independent third-party accounting, legal or other professional services firms for the provision
of services to our clients. We may provide a list of such professionals to our client for their selection and determination which professionals
they want to engage. 

Terms
of Professional Agreements for Our Services . 

1. Description
and Scope of the professional services to be performed by the Company , which typically include: 

a. assistance
with incorporation of a new entity under the laws of Cayman Islands and a company that will become its wholly-owned subsidiary under
the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People s Republic of China, 

b. development
 and preparation of business and operational plans, and may include 

i. preparation
of legal forms and other advisory services, as well as 

ii. referral
of clients to independent third-party legal and other professional services firms and 

iii. acting
as the liaison for the flow of information and documentation between clients and professional services firms, as to be determined by
the clients. 

2 

All
professional services agreements with client contain explicit disclaimers that we do not provide legal advice to our clients. 

2. Project
 timeline and payment terms : 

a. 45 
 of the project management fee is payable upon signing of our standard professional services
 agreements; 

b. 45 
 of the project management fee is payable when the services described in the professional
 services agreement are substantially performed by the Company; and 

c. the
 remaining 10 of the project management fee is payable upon completion of the project. 

3. Project
 timeline and payment terms : 

a. Access
 to international capital markets Listing of the issuer s securities in
 the United States provides non-U.S. companies with added liquidity compared with local non-U.S.
 stock exchanges. This, in turn, increases marketability of their products and services, as
 well as increases the potential to access a greater range of capital financing, if necessary,
 than if the companies were to be listed on a local exchange.	 

b. Access
 to new markets for products and services Being listed in the U.S. offers brand
 recognition in the U.S.; therefore, U.S. companies may prefer to conduct business with U.S.
 listed foreign companies rather than privately-held or foreign exchange listed companies. 

c. Costs
 of listing Listing on a non-U.S. stock exchange, in a country such as China or
 Hong Kong, costs comparatively more in professional fees than on OTC Markets Group (OTCQX,
 OTCQB and Pink). In addition, such non-U.S. stock exchanges typically have listing requirements
 that small, development-stage companies cannot meet. 

We
operate in the corporate advisory services sector within the consulting industry in East Asia. The market for our services consists mainly
of non-U.S. companies who desire to gain access to international capital markets, specifically in the United States. 

We
believe that we currently do not meet the definition of an investment company pursuant to Section 3 of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ). The Investment Company Act defines an investment company as an issuer
which (a) is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting,
or trading in securities, (b) is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of issuing face-amount certificates of the installment
type, or has been engaged in such business and has any such certificate outstanding, or (c) is engaged or proposes to engage in the business
of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a
value exceeding 40 percent of the value of such issuer s total assets (excluding government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated
basis. We are in the business of managing the listing of non-U.S. companies. The ordinary shares of client companies we receive or purchase
in our listing assignments are incidental to our main business and are typically sold to the public after a minimum holding period of
12 months. We do not plan to hold investment securities which exceed 40 percent of the value of our total assets. However, if we determine
that we were to inadvertently meet the Investment Company Act definition of an investment company in the future, and have
no viable exemption, we would register as an investment company. 

Distribution
Methods of Our Services 

We
provide services to companies based in Hong Kong presently. Our marketing strategy is to foster strategic alliances with management s
prior business associates, third-party legal and accounting firms and other professional service firms, through which we expect to garner
referrals and gain brand exposure at minimal cost. We have approached some of these persons and entities with regard to generating referrals,
although we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. 

3 

If
we receive a direct referral from an independent consultant, we either serve the client together as joint project managers if responsibilities
are shared between us, or we act as the sole project manager if the referring consultant is not involved in the provision of services.
Under the joint project management scenario, no referral fee is paid to the referring consultant. Instead, we share the joint project
management fee with the consultant, typically on the basis that 60 of the cash component of the standard joint project management fee,
and a negotiated amount of any stock compensation, being attributable to us. In the event that the cash compensation is more than our
standard amount, sharing of the excess amount, if any, will be distributed on a negotiated basis. Under the sole project management scenario,
we only pay a referral fee to the referring consultant. The maximum amount of our referral fees is 15 on our sole project management
fee. The referral fee for each individual project is determined by negotiation and is only payable after the referred assignment is successfully
completed. The current cash component of our standard joint project management fee is 150,000. Our current sole project management fee
is 90,000 to 150,000, depending on negotiation, plus a negotiated amount of stock compensation. Our directors review these charges
periodically and adjust them to enhance our competitiveness under prevailing market conditions. 

We
expect to pay a referral fee to any of our shareholders, officers, directors, and employees in the event that we have successfully completed
an assignment as either a joint project manager or a sole project manager as a result of receiving a referral from any of these parties
The amount of referral fee payable by us to any of these parties is determined on a negotiated basis and is in line with the referral
fees payable to independent consultants, which has a maximum of 15 on our total project management fee. 

We
have adopted a policy not to pay referral fees to accounting firms and legal firms if the referring firms are also engaged to provide
any services to the referred clients on an ongoing basis. Referral fees, which are comparable to those payable to independent consultants,
will be paid to these professional firms only if these payments are permissible under applicable laws and regulations and standards of
professional ethics. Since inception, we have not received referrals from any accounting firms or legal firms. 

We
have not established specific criteria regarding operating history, minimum earnings, minimum assets, minimum net worth, or other operating
or financial criteria for our clients or potential clients. Accordingly, we may provide services to potential clients having losses,
no significant operating history, limited or no potential for immediate earnings, limited assets, negative net worth or other negative
characteristics. We may, however, consider other factors, including (but not limited to) the potential client s long-term growth
possibilities, as well as its strategic position relative to other companies in its location and industry, in deciding to enter into
a business relationship with a potential client. Notwithstanding the absence of established criteria with respect to its selection of
clients, we prefer to recruit clients with operating histories with long-term growth potential, and/or with business relationship with
U.S. companies. 

Competitive
Business Conditions and the Issuer s Competitive Position 

We
have not obtained market research conducted by independent and qualified professionals to ascertain the demand for the type of services
we intend to provide. We also have no access to information as to the number of professional firms providing services similar to those
rendered by us. Our officers and directors, however, are aware that most major U.S. investment banks have established offices in Hong
Kong. These offices offer companies in Hong Kong and China a full range of investment banking services, including initial public offering
and other capital market advisory services in the U.S. Our officers and directors are also aware of several small and medium size U.S.
investment banks, as well as local consultants in Hong Kong and China, providing similar U.S. public listing services. 

We
believe that investment banking firms offer services to assist companies enter the capital markets by way of attaining listings on stock
exchanges. Investment banks provide consulting and advisory services to assist companies become reporting and publicly traded. It is
in this manner that we believe will be competing with investment banks. Although raising or finding capital for companies is one service
of the many that the investment banks provide, we have no intention of offering these services. As and when our clients intend to raise
capital, we will refer them to sources which are licensed to find capital in the jurisdiction where the capital is to be raised. A referral
fee will be chargeable to these sources on a successful basis. Under no circumstances will we direct the decision-making process of our
clients in securing capital. We, however, will assist our clients in assembling company and industry information for presentation purposes,
and to act as a coordinator for the dissemination of information amongst all parties involved in a fund-raising exercise. We intend to
charge our clients project management fees at negotiated rates for services provided. 

4 

There
are many consulting firms and financial services firms which have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical
expertise than ours. Our competitors in some instances will be larger, more established companies, some of which may possess substantially
greater financial, marketing and operational resources than we do. In view of our limited financial and human resources, we have significant
competitive disadvantages compared to our competitors. 

Employees 

As
of June 30, 2024, we did not have any employees. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
do not own or license any intellectual property. 

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS. 

As
a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information called
for by this Item. 

ITEM 1B.
UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. 

None. 

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY. 

We have developed and maintain a cybersecurity
risk management methodology intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information.
Our cybersecurity risk management methodology is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management, and shares common methodologies,
reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the Company to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial
risk areas. As part of our overall risk management processes and procedures, we have instituted a cybersecurity awareness designed to
identify, assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The cyber risk management methodology involves risk assessments,
implementation of security measures and ongoing monitoring of systems and networks, including networks on which we rely. Through our cybersecurity
awareness, the current threat landscape is actively monitored in an effort to identify material risks arising from new and evolving cybersecurity
threats. We may engage external experts, including cybersecurity assessors, consultants and auditors to evaluate cybersecurity measures
and risk management processes as needed. We also depend on and engage various third parties, including suppliers, vendors and service
providers in connection with our operations. Our risk management, legal, and compliance personnel oversee and identify, including through
a third-party cybersecurity service provider, material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of such entities. 

Cybersecurity Governance 

Our Board of Directors oversees our risk
management, including our information technology and cybersecurity policies, procedures, and risk assessments. Management reports to our
Board of Directors on information security matters as necessary, regarding any significant cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents
with lesser impact potential. 

One of the key functions of our Board of
Directors is informed oversight of our various processes for managing risk. An overall review of risk is inherent in our Board of Directors
ongoing consideration of our long-term strategies, transactions and other matters presented to and discussed by the Board of Directors.
This includes a discussion of the likelihood and potential magnitude of various risk.

ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES. 

We currently do not have
any written agreement or any legally enforceable arrangements with respect to leasing or renting property for office use. We also do
not own any real property. The Company utilizes the office space and equipment of Flywheel Financial Strategy (Hong Kong) Company Ltd,
a Hong Kong company Flywheel ), at no cost with Flywheel s permission. Ka Ki Wong, our director, Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Operating Officer, is also a director of Flywheel. As such, Flywheel is free to discontinue providing the office space
without cost at any time and without notice. The Company believes that its current office space and available business equipment of is
sufficient for operations. The Company currently has no investments or interests in real estate, real estate mortgages or securities
of, or interests in, persons primarily engaged in real estate activities and does not intend to invest in real estate, real estate mortgages
or securities, or interests in persons primarily engaged in real estate activities. 

In
the event that Flywheel discontinues providing the office space without cost at any time, we believe we can successfully negotiate leased
office space from Flywheel or another local provider of office space without material cost or disruption to the Company s operations. 

ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

We
know of no active or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any proceedings or pending litigation.
There are no proceedings in which any of our director, officers or affiliates, or any 5 or greater beneficial shareholder are an adverse
party or has a material interest adverse to us.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The
information set forth in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including,
among others (I) increase in our revenue and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii) our strategy for financing
our business. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition. Some forward-looking

These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete financing, to enter into future agreements with
companies, and plans to successfully expend our business operations and the sale of our products. We have based these forward-looking

Overview 

The
Company is a newly formed holding company incorporated on August 18, 2022, under the laws of the Cayman Islands with no material
operations of its own. The Company conducts all its operations in Hong Kong through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Protopia International
Company Limited Protopia HK ), incorporated in Hong Kong on August 26, 2022, which have just started its business
operations. 

Protopia HK is an advisory
and consulting company that also acts as a project manager to small- and medium-sized companies with business operations in Hong Kong
to access international capital markets. We help such companies with the process of the initial listing on US nationally recognized stock
exchanges such as the Nasdaq Global Market, the Nasdaq Capital Market, NYSE American or the OTC Markets (OTCQX, OTCQB and Pink) by providing
consulting, liaison and coordination services. We also assist these or other publicly traded companies that are listed on the national
security exchanges or on OTCQX and OTCQB with maintaining continuing eligibility requirements and compliance with those listing rules,
regulations, or standards, as applicable. While our clients are currently businesses located in Hong Kong, we intend to expand the distribution
of our services into mainland China as opportunities permit.

Plan
of Operations 

Over
the course of the 12 months following our initial public offering Public Offering pursuant to the registration statement
on Form S-1 that was declared effective by the SEC on May 12, 2023 (the registration Statement ), we plan to spend
a substantial portion of our effort in the promotion of our services to potential clients. We intend to utilize the business network
of shareholders, officers, directors and employees to identify potential opportunities. 

Our
Board of Directors has adopted a policy to pay a referral fee to our shareholders, officers, directors, and employees in the event that
we have successfully completed an assignment as either a joint project manager or a sole project manager as a result of receiving a referral
from any of these parties. The amount of the referral fee payable by us to any of these parties is determined on a negotiated basis and
is in line with that payable to independent consultants, which has a maximum of 15 on our project management fee including both the
cash component and stock compensation, if any. If we receive a direct referral from an independent consultant, we either serve the client
together as joint project managers, if responsibilities are shared between us, or we act as the sole project manager, if the referring
consultant is not involved in the provision of services. The referral fee for each individual project is determined by negotiation and
is only payable after the referred assignment is successfully completed. Our directors review these charges periodically and adjust them
to enhance our competitiveness under prevailing market conditions. The payment of successful-basis referral fees to our shareholders,
officers, directors and employees is designed to serve as an incentive for them to develop our business with a collective effort. 

Our
estimated costs for the next 12 months will be 400,000. If we fail to raise sufficient capital in the Public Offering, we will have
to explore other financing activities to provide us with the liquidity and capital resources we need to meet our working capital requirements
and to make capital investments in connection with ongoing operations. We cannot give assurance that we are able to secure needed capital
to support our day-to-day operations. If we do not have sufficient capital to support our day-to-day operations, our shareholders may
lose their entire investment in us. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Going
Concern Uncertainties 

As
discussed in the notes to financial statements included in this Annual Report, as of June 30, 2024, the Company had 1,493 of cash
all of which will be used to pay the estimate general and administrative expenses to maintain the Company s operation. If the Company
fails to raise sufficient capital in the Public Offering, it will have to explore other financing activities to provide it with the liquidity
and capital resources it needs to meet its working capital requirements and to make capital investments in connection with ongoing operations.
The Company cannot give assurance that it will be able to secure the necessary capital when needed. Consequently, the Company raises
substantial doubt that it will be able to continue operations as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon its generating cash flow sufficient to fund operations and reducing operating expenses. The Company s
business plans may not be successful in addressing the cash flow issues. If the Company cannot continue as a going concern, its shareholders
may lose their entire investment in the Company. 

10 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not
being able to continue as a going concern. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements. The estimates are based on historical
experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from
these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical
to our results of operations or financial position. Our critical accounting estimates are more fully discussed in Note 3 to our audited
financial statements contained herein.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Protopia Global Holdings Inc. and Subsidiary 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Protopia Global Holdings Inc. and Subsidiary (the Company as of June 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders deficit, and cash
flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
June 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or
disclosures to which it relates. 

Going
 Concern As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
 the Company has a going concern due to negative working capital and losses from operations
 which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Auditing
 management s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the
 fact that the Company uses management estimates on future revenues and expenses, which are
 difficult to substantiate. To evaluate the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined
 and evaluated the financial information along with management s plans to mitigate the
 going concern and management s disclosure on going concern.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To: 
 The Board of Directors
 and Shareholders of 

Protopia Global Holdings
 Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Protopia Global Holdings Inc. (the Company as of June 30,
2023, and the related consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows
for the period from August 18, 2022 (inception) to June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from August 18, 2022 (inception)
to June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses during the period from August 18, 2022 (inception) to June 30,
2023 and has an accumulated deficit and net cash used in operating activities that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is described in Note 2 of the financial statements. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding

On
August 26, 2022, Protopia International Company Limited Protopia HK ), was incorporated in Hong Kong as the Company s
wholly-owned subsidiary, and its principal activities are to assist small- and medium-sized non-U.S. businesses in accessing international
capital markets through listings on nationally recognized stock exchanges such as the Nasdaq Global Market, the Nasdaq Capital Market,
NYSE American or the OTC Markets Group (OTCQX, OTCQB and Pink). 

The
fiscal year end of the Company is June 30. 

of cash all of which will be used to pay the unpaid amount of the estimate costs of
the Company s Proposed Public Offering discussed in Note 4. If the Company fails to raise sufficient capital in this offering,
it will have to explore other financing activities to provide it with the liquidity and capital resources it needs to meet its
working capital requirements and to make capital investments in connection with ongoing operations. Management anticipates that the
Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to
position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. Since the Company cannot give
assurance that it will be able to secure the necessary capital when needed, there is a substantial doubt that the Company will be
able to continue operations as a going concern following the issuance of these financial statements. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from its inability to consummate the Proposed Public Offering or its inability to continue
as a going concern. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial
accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective
or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to optout is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of
such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public
or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s consolidated financial statements with another public
company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition
period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure. 

Management
has identified control deficiencies regarding inadequate accounting resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger
internal control environment. Management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the Company s
accounting staff. The small size of the Company s accounting outsourced staff may prevent adequate controls in the future due to
the cost/benefit of such remediation. 

To
mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with
the use of external legal and accounting professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable
us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework. 

These
control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement to our financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed
additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2024 included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our material weaknesses,
our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2024 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
 transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
 financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
 our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
 management and directors; and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
 use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

12 

Because
of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. In making this
assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 2013 Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based upon this assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that as of June 30, 2024 our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

The
following table sets forth, as of the date of this prospectus, the beneficial ownership of our Ordinary Shares by each executive officer
and director, by each person known by us to beneficially own more than 5 of our Ordinary Shares and by the executive officers and directors

The
persons named above have full voting and investment power with respect to the Ordinary Shares indicated. Under the rules of the Commission,
a person (or group of persons) is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if he or she, directly or indirectly, has

security. Accordingly, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same security. A person is also deemed to be
a beneficial owner of any security, which that person has the right to acquire within 60 days, such as options or warrants to purchase
our Ordinary Shares.
