Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 The following report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are statements that predict or describe future events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. All of our projections in this annual report are forward-looking statements. You can generally identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words appears, believe, expect, hope, may, will, anticipate, intend, estimate, project, assume or other similar expressions. Certain factors that might cause such a difference include the following: changes in general economic conditions; including changes that may influence group conference and guests vacation plans; changes in travel patterns; changes in consumer tastes in destinations or accommodations for group conferences and vacations; changes in Rental Pool participation by the current condominium owners; our ability to continue to operate the Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club, or the Resort under our management contracts; and the resale of condominiums to owners who elect neither to participate in the Rental Pool nor to become members of the Resort. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements because the matters they describe are subject to known (and unknown) risks, uncertainties and other unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our forward-looking statements are based on the limited information currently available to us and speak only as of the date on which this report was filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. Our continued internet posting or subsequent distribution of this dated report does not imply continued affirmation of the forward-looking statements included in it. We undertake no obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to issue any updates to our forward-looking statements, even if subsequent events cause our expectations to change regarding the matters discussed in those statements. Future events are inherently uncertain. Moreover, it is particularly difficult to predict business activity levels at the Resort with any certainty. Accordingly, our projections in this annual report are subject to particularly high uncertainty. 
 
 Our projections should not be regarded as legal promises, representations or warranties of any kind whatsoever. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and harmful to your interests.

PA RT I 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Background 
 Salamander Innisbrook, LLC (the Company was organized on June 14, 2007, by Salamander Farms, LLC under the laws of the state of Florida for the purpose of owning and operating Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club (the Resort or "Innisbrook"). The Company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Salamander Innisbrook Securities, LLC and Salamander Innisbrook Condominium, LLC, are hereinafter referred to as we , us , our . On July 16, 2007, we purchased the Resort, three condominiums, which became Salamander Innisbrook Condominiums, LLC, and all of the equity interests in Golf Host Securities, Inc. from Golf Trust of America, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Resort is a full service 63-hole destination golf and conference facility located near Tampa, Florida. The Resort features 1,216 condominium rooms, all of which are owned by third parties or affiliates. Approximately 296 condominium owners (representing 295 hotel rooms) participate in a rental pool (the Rental Pool we operate. 
 Rental Pool Condominiums 
 Condominium ownership is a realty subdivision in which the individual lots are deemed apartment units. Instead of owning a plot of ground, the condominium owners own the space where their condominium units are located. This leaves substantial properties in interest which are not individually owned, such as the underlying land, driveways, parking lots, building foundations, exterior walls and roofs, garden areas and utility lines. These areas are termed common property or common elements. Each condominium owner has an undivided fractional interest in the common property. 
 The condominium owners at the Resort have established an Association of Condominium Owners (the Association ), to administer and maintain this common property and to conduct the business of the condominium owners. In particular, the Association is responsible for maintaining insurance on the real property, upkeep of the structures, maintenance of the grounds, electricity for the common areas, water/sewer and security services. The Association assesses fees to defray these expenses and to establish necessary reserves. An assessment, if not timely paid, may result in a lien being placed upon the unit of a delinquent condominium owner. Each condominium owner must pay ad valorem property taxes, contents insurance, interior maintenance and other matters independent of the other unit owners. These expenses are incurred by each owner of condominium units whether or not the unit participates in the Rental Pool at the Resort. With respect to governing the affairs of the Association, the participating condominium owners are accorded one vote per condominium unit owned. State statutes also impact the way in which the Association s affairs are administered. 
 Markets and Marketing 
 The Resort is located in Palm Harbor, Florida and is a destination golf resort that appeals to group convention business and leisure travelers within all market segments. The Resort caters to corporate meeting planners and sports enthusiasts within a variety of industries, the majority of which are located in central and eastern United States. The Resort markets through most of the typical channels utilizing e-commerce, print media, third party representation firms, travel agents and wholesalers. 
 The Resort provides condominium accommodations, four dining locations, room service, over 65,000 square feet of banquet and catering space, 63 holes of golf, golf instruction, a full-service spa and fitness center, tennis center and recreational entertainment to members, business meeting attendees, group meeting guests, leisure guests and their families. The Resort offers room-only rates, golf packages, and family vacation packages. Larger golf or conference groups typically involve contractual agreements. Accordingly, we do not believe that the loss of a single conference or even a few conferences of average size would have a significant adverse impact on our business taken as a whole. 
 The Resort s accommodations are condominium units that are owned by third parties or us. These units are sold by registered securities brokers, including Golf Host Securities, Inc., which is one of our subsidiaries. 
 Seasonality 
 The Florida resort industry is seasonal in nature and historically the Resort s business levels are stronger in the winter and spring months as guests come from the northeast and other colder regions to enjoy the warm weather. In contrast, there is a decline in business levels during the summer months as the hot summer weather makes Florida less appealing for group golf outings and vacation destination golfers. The Resort uses seasonal pricing (peak, shoulder and off-peak) to maximize revenues. The Resort may also experience reduced bookings as a result of hurricane-related concerns. 
 PGA TOUR Event 
 
 The 2023 Valspar Championship, a nationally televised, annual PGA TOUR event, was contested at Innisbrook s Copperhead course March 16-19, 2023. There is an agreement between the PGA TOUR, Copperhead Charities and Innisbrook through and including the 
 5 

Table of Contents 

2025 event to contest the event on the Copperhead course. This coincides with the current agreement between Valspar and the PGA TOUR that expires after the 2025 event. 
 Intellectual Property 
 The Resort has registered service marks and domain names that are necessary for the Resort to effectively conduct business. Service marks include Innisbrook #955489, registered March 13, 1973, and the Innisbrook shield logo #955488 registered March 13, 1973. The operations of the Resort are not considered to be dependent upon the availability of raw materials, nor any adverse effects that may result from the duration of patents, licenses, franchises or concessions. 
 Competition 
 Conveniently located near the Florida Gulf Coast and Tampa International Airport, the Resort is located within approximately 600 acres of a dramatically landscaped setting. The Resort competes using a unique price/value strategy through its offering of spacious accommodations, high levels of customer service, award-winning golf, and one of the largest conference facilities in the southeastern United States. The Resort s major competitors are other similar golf and conference-oriented resorts in the southeastern United States. 
 Research and Development 
 We have no research and development expenses. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Operation of the golf courses at the Resort involves the use and storage of various hazardous materials such as herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers, motor oils and gasoline. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of hazardous substances. As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any violations of these laws, ordinances and regulations. 
 Government Regulation 
 The Resort is subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA of 1990. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities , but generally requires public facilities such as clubhouses and recreation areas to be accessible to people with disabilities. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. We are responsible for compliance costs incurred at the Resort. The condominiums in the Rental Pool are residential properties and are not subject to ADA. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2023, we had 431employees; 292 full-time and 139 part-time. We also periodically engage casual laborers as needed. 
 Code of Ethics 
 See Part III, Item 10 for discussion of our Code of Business Conduct. 
 ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS 
 Not required for Smaller Reporting Company. 
 ITEM 1B. UNRE SOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
 None. 
 ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 Cybersecurity risk management is an important part of our overall risk management efforts. We maintain a cybersecurity program that is comprised of policies, procedures, controls and plans whose objective is to help us prevent and effectively respond to cybersecurity threats or incidents. Through our cybersecurity risk management process, we monitor cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors to company systems. We, directly and through our third-party service providers, maintain various measures to safeguard against cybersecurity threats such as monitoring systems, security controls, policy enforcement, data encryption, employee training, tools and services from third-party providers and management oversight to assess, identify and mitigate risks from cybersecurity threats. We and our third-party service providers conduct regular testing of these controls and systems including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and simulating the execution of parts of our disaster recovery plan.

Table of Contents 

We have implemented cybersecurity frameworks, policies and practices which incorporate industry-standards and contractual requirements. We gather information and review security protocols of certain third parties who integrate with our systems, such as our payroll processor, managed solutions provider, and software as a service provider, on an annual basis to identify and manage risk. We regularly seek to improve and mature our cybersecurity processes. We apply lessons learned from our efforts to help prevent attacks and utilize data analytics to detect anomalies and search for cyber threats. 
 Cybersecurity threats of all types, such as attacks from computer hackers, cyber criminals, nation-state actors, social engineering and other malicious internet-based activities, continue to increase generally in business and society. We believe that our current preventative actions and response planning provide adequate measures of protection against cybersecurity risks. While we have implemented measures to safeguard our information technology systems, the evolving nature of cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities means that these protections may not always be effective. In 2023, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not experienced undetected cybersecurity incidents. 
 Governance 
 Our finance and IT consultants have oversight of our strategic and business risk management and oversees management s execution of our cybersecurity risk management program. They receive updates from management on our cybersecurity risks as may be required or prudent. In addition, management updates the home office executive committee as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents. Management is responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures, maintaining cybersecurity policies and procedures, and providing regular reports to our home office executive committee. In the event of an incident, we intend to follow our incident response plan, which outlines the steps to be followed from incident detection to mitigation, recovery and notification, including notifying functional areas (e.g. legal), as well as senior leadership, as appropriate. 
 Our Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller oversees our cybersecurity program and is responsible for our overall information security strategy, policy, security engineering, operations and cyber threat detection and response. These officers work with other members of management, employees and outside service providers to promote and evolve our cybersecurity protocols and systems. 
 There were no material cybersecurity incidents in 2023 or up to the date of this filing. 
 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 The Resort is situated on approximately 600 acres of land located in the northern portion of Pinellas County, Florida, near the Gulf of Mexico. It is approximately 9 miles north of Clearwater and approximately 20 miles west of Tampa. There are 938 condominium units, 36 of which are strictly residential, with the balance eligible for Rental Pool participation. Of the 902 remaining eligible units, approximately 250 participate in the Rental Pool. See additional discussion in Item 1 under the caption Rental Pool Condominiums. These condominium units are leased by us from the condominium owners and used as hotel accommodations for the Resort. We also own three condominium units, all of which participate in the Rental Pool in the same fashion as all other Rental Pool participants. Approximately 20 of the units have lockout master bedroom units, which allow the rental of the condominium unit as two hotel rooms. As a result of the potential use of lockout master bedroom units, the total number of rooms at the resort is 1,218 and the average number of units participating in the Rental Pool at any one time is equivalent to approximately 295 hotel rooms. The Resort complex includes 63 holes of golf, practice ranges, three clubhouses with retail, golf, and food and beverage outlets, three conference and exhibit buildings, a full-service spa and fitness center, six swimming pools including a themed water attraction, a recreation facility, a tennis facility, and numerous administrative and support structures. These amenities are owned by the Resort and have undergone substantial renovation and improvements since we purchased the Resort in 2007. 
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 At December 31, 2021, we were involved in certain litigation arising from a full-service construction contract we previously entered (as agent for and on behalf of the Rental Pool participants) with AMH Construction, Inc. AMH in the amount of 3,420,670. The litigation arose from our decision to terminate the contract with AMH for breach of contract, including AMH's failure to complete the renovation work in accordance with the contract schedule. On April 18, 2019, we served a demand letter to AMH asserting damages of 4,423,070 for the additional costs incurred by the Participating Owners and return of deposits made for work that was not performed. On July 13, 2022, we entered into a settlement agreement with AMH, whereby, among other things AMH signed a confessed judgment in the amount of 4,012,154, which was to be paid over a two-year period. Payments began on August 1, 2022, and were supposed to continue through December 1, 2024; however, on December 15, 2022, AMH filed for Chapter 7 (also

commonly known as liquidation bankruptcy. We received total payments of approximately 165,000 prior to such bankruptcy filing. 
 
 On July 10, 2024, the Trustee for the United States Bankruptcy Court, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division issued its final report of the Chapter 7 petition proceedings. The report states that liquidated assets were not sufficient to pay the total claims from secured creditors and no payments were made to unsecured creditors, including the Company. The Company had previously written off all amounts owed by AMH so there is no financial impact to the Company. There will be no further action on this matter. 
 ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 None.

 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 We are a single member limited liability company and do not have any stock. Our membership interests are not publicly traded. 
 There are 902 deeded condominium units allowing Rental Pool participation by their owners, of which three are owned by us. 
 The condominium units that are leased to us for Rental Pool participation, are deemed to be securities. These units are hereinafter referred to as Rental Pool Securities. These securities are deemed securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, but there is no market for such securities other than sales through the normal real estate market. 
 Because the Rental Pool Securities are real estate related, no dividends have been paid or will be paid to their owners. However, the Rental Pool lease agreements provide that the Rental Pool participants are entitled to a contractual distribution paid quarterly in exchange for our right to use their condominium units in the Rental Pool. 
 ITEM 6. SELEC TED FINANCIAL DATA 
 Not required for Smaller Reporting Company.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The following accounting policies are considered critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These and other accounting policies require that estimates be made based on assumptions and judgment, which can affect the reporting of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingencies in our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ from changes in these estimates and assumptions. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Revenues are derived from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, hotel, food and beverage operations, retail sales, golf course operations and commissions on real estate transactions. With the exception of initiation fees and membership dues, all revenues net of any sales and other taxes collected are recognized as products are delivered or services are performed. 
 A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under the new revenue recognition standard. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of our revenue is transactional, and the contracts performance obligation is generally satisfied at the time of the transaction. 
 Revenues from performance obligations satisfied over time include membership dues, annual fees and initiation fees. The membership initiation fees at the Resort are non-refundable and are initially recorded when received as deferred revenue and amortized over the average life of a membership which, based on historical information, is deemed to be ten years for full golf members and five years for resort and executive memberships. Membership dues and annual fees are recognized over the applicable membership period (three months to one year depending on type of membership). 
 Intangible Assets 
 We evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or at an interim date if a significant event occurs or circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, and which could indicate impairment, include the following: (I) significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends. 
 Our intangible assets consist of: (i) a water contract; and (ii) our trademark and trade name. The valuation of the water contract is based on the projected annual savings associated with having this contract. The valuation of the trademark and trade name is derived from the residual revenue streams from Resort revenues that is attributed to the Innisbrook trade name. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no impairment charges related to intangible assets. 
 Impairment of Other Long-Lived Assets 
 We review other long-lived assets for impairment if a significant event occurs or circumstances arise that indicate the assets may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying values of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In reviewing impairment of our long-lived assets, we review the recent operating and pricing trends with the financial performance of the Resort in the aggregate for material variances from our expectations of the Resort s revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no impairments charges related to other long lived assets. 
 Loss Contingencies 
 We estimate loss contingencies in accordance with FASB ASC 450-20 Loss Contingencies, which states that a loss contingency shall be accrued by a charge to operations if both of the following conditions are met: (a) information available before the consolidated financial statements are issued or are available to be issued indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

During 2023 overall resort revenues increased by 2,185,784 or 4.9 compared with the prior year. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by rooms revenues, which increased 7.3 over the prior year due to stronger group and leisure demand. The golf and membership departments also contributed with increased golf rounds from member and guest play. Total costs and expenses increased year-over-year by 4,090,566 or 9.5 which is attributable to higher inflation and the increase in revenues across the same period. 
 
 Interest expenses increased in 2023 due to higher interest rates on our long-term debt obligation. We recorded a provision for income taxes for the first time in 2023 due to taxable income generated by our sole tax paying subsidiary. FY 2023 also includes a non-recurring gain on sale of certain assets to Toll Brothers, Inc. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash generated from operating activities was 1,004,916 and 3,406,283 in 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of 2,401,367. The decrease resulted primarily from our current year operating loss caused primarily by an increased loss due to inflation. 
 
 We generated cash of approximately 8,276,000 f rom investing activities in 2023 whereas we used cash of approximately 1,427,000 for such activities in 2022. Although our property purchases tripled in 2023 compared to 2022, we received proceeds of approximately 12,539,000 from the aforementioned sale of certain assets in 2023. 
 
 We used cash of approximately 1,971,000 and 804,000 in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase relates to cash of 1,000,000 distributed to our member in 2023. 
 
 We believe our cash on hand is adequate to support our capital and operating expenditures in 2024 and beyond. 
 Legal Entity Structure 
 Salamander Innisbrook, LLC is a single member limited liability company with Salamander Farms, LLC as the sole member. 
 Income Tax Status 
 
 With the exception of an entity owned by Salamander Innisbrook Securities, LLC the Company and its subsidiaries are single member limited liability companies and therefore the majority of the results of our operations flow through to our member for inclusion in its income tax returns. In 2023, we provided for income taxes of approximately 168,000 related to our tax paying subsidiary. No provision and/or benefit for deferred income taxes has been recorded as there are no significant differences between financial statement and tax reporting. 
 We have adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . Under this topic, we are required to evaluate each of our tax positions to determine if they are more likely than not to be sustained if the taxing authority examines the

respective position. A tax position includes an entity s tax status, as a pass-through entity, and the decision not to file a tax return. We have evaluated each of our tax positions and have determined that no provision or liability for income taxes is necessary. 
 We evaluate the validity of our conclusions regarding uncertain income tax positions on an annual basis to determine if facts or circumstances have arisen that might cause us to change our judgment regarding the likelihood of a tax position s sustainability under examination.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risks arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The carrying value of variable rate debt financing reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023, approximates fair value as the changes in their associated interest rates reflect the current market and credit risk is similar to when the loans were originally obtained. 
 We are obligated under a note payable with interest at the SOFR rate plus 2.30 per annum adjusted monthly. The loan is collateralized by our real and personal property and guarantees of certain affiliates. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the note payable consisted of the following: 

Principal as of December 31, 2023

 ITEM 9A. CONT ROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d -15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be reported in our SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. At December 31, 2023, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, at December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework stated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered certified public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

 Land Development and Sale Contract 
 
 On April 13, 2021, we entered into an Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Real Property with Toll Southeast LP. Company, Inc. Toll Brothers for the sale and residential development of approximately 54 acres of land along the northern boundary of the property, contingent upon approval of a land use plan amendment and an amendment to the Residential Planned Development ("RPD") master plan for Innisbrook from Pinellas County and other governmental agencies, as well as receipt of an approved site plan. On October 25, 2022, the Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners unanimously approved our application to amend the Master Plan and Plan Amendments and adopted Ordinance No. 22-31, which amended the Countywide Plan Map, ordinance No. 22-36 which amended the Future Land Use Map, and Resolution No. 22-95 for modification of the Development Master Plan on a RPD. Toll Brothers received final site plan approval from Pinellas County on October 6, 2023. 
 
 On November 16, 2023, we consummated the sale of these assets to TLB 174 Palm Harbor, L.P., the land banker for Toll Brothers. The sale resulted in net proceeds to us of 12,538,775 and a gain of 10,112,457. In addition, the Purchase and Sale Agreement provides for us to receive additional proceeds of 10 of any sales proceeds received by Toll Brothers in excess of 700,000 for single family homes and 475,000 for townhouses. Toll Brothers intends to build 122 single family homes and 52 townhomes. Site clearing and grading have begun, and Toll Brothers expects to have a model home completed and begin sales activities before the end of the year.

 ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND R ELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
 (a) Transactions with Management and Others 

None. 
 (b) Certain Business Relationships 

Under the Master Lease Agreement (the Agreement or MLA with the Rental Pool participants (which expired on December 31, 2023, and was replaced with a new agreement as more fully described below), the Resort paid Participants a quarterly distribution equal to 40 of the Adjusted Gross Revenues on the first 10 million, 45 between 10 million and 11 million, and 50 above 11 million. Adjusted Gross Revenues are defined as Gross Revenues less agent s commissions, audit fees, and occupancy fees and when the unit is used for Rental Pool Comps or as a model, linen replacements and credit card fees. Each participant receives a fixed occupancy fee, based upon apartment size for each day the unit is occupied. After allocation of occupancy fees and the payment of general Rental Pool expenses, the balance is allocated proportionally to the participants, based on the Participation Factor as defined in the Agreement. Additionally, occupancy fees are paid by the Resort to participants as rental fees for complimentary rooms unrelated to the Rental Pool operations. Associate room fees are also paid by the Resort to Participants for total room revenues earned from the rental of condominiums by our employees. In 2023 and 2022, amounts available to Participants under the Agreement approximated 3,717,000 and 3,473,000, respectively, of which approximately 705,000 and 690,000 was owed as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The balances owed, along with the incentives discussed in the following paragraph, are reflected as a Rental Pool liability in our consolidated balance sheets. The amounts were paid in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 On August 20, 2018, the Second Addendum to the Master Lease Agreement became effective. The addendum defined the Turn- Key renovation, the customization of certain units that did not require a full renovation and provided for an incentive payment plan Incentive to be paid to Participants. The Incentive provides for a quarterly payment to each Participant, beginning on January 1, 2019, and ending on December 31, 2023, so long as their units continue to participate in the Rental Pool. Incentive payments due as of December 31, 2023, and 2022 totaled approximately 112,000 and 94,000, respectively. 
 On July 2, 2019, the Third Addendum to the MLA became effective. The addendum provided Participants with two options for funding of the cost overruns created by the default of AMH Construction, Inc. AMH ). The first option provided that we would fund the cost overruns in exchange for the Participating Owner s dedication of their unit to the Rental Pool as evidenced by a Memorandum of Lease recorded against the title of such participant s unit in the land records of Pinellas County. The second option provided an additional incentive payment equal to the cost overrun amount in the form of quarterly payments,adjusted annually, resulting in a reimbursement of 10 of the total amount in 2019, 15 in 2020, 20 in 2021, 25 in 2022, and the remainder in 2023. Participants choosing option 1 represented 192 units (233 doors) and Participants choosing option 2 represented 13 units (15 doors). For option 1, we paid Participants 3,146,363 in 2019, which amount is being amortized over the five-year term of the Participants lease dedication beginning January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2023. 
 The Agreement was replaced in its entirety by a new seven-year Agreement (the "New MLA") on November 21, 2023. The New MLA is effective on January 1, 2024, and will expire on December 31, 2030.Under the new Agreement, the Resort will pay Participants a quarterly distribution equal to 42 of the Adjusted Gross Revenues (as defined above) on the first 8.7 million, 45 between 8.7 million and 9.7 million, and 50 above 9.7 million.The Incentive described is not included in the revised MLA. Additionally, the new Agreement requires Participants to maintain an escrow balance equal to 1,000 plus an amount equal to an Aging Factor, which represents fifty percent (50 of the estimated costs of future renovation to the Units in order to maintain the Standard established under the Agreement. The rest of the Agreement remains substantially similar to the expired Agreement. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Rental Pool Lease Operation reimbursed us approximately 225,000 and 197,000 in 2023 and 2022, respectively, for maintenance and housekeeping labor, use of the telephone lines, and other supplies. 
 All three condominiums that we own participated in the Rental Pool under the Agreement in the same manner as all other Rental Pool participants in 2023. 
 At December 31, 2023 and 2022 we were owed 184,890 and 99,047, respectively, from Innisbrook Condominium Association, a third party collectively owned by the condominium owners at Innisbrook.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Fir m 

To the Sole Member and Manager 
 Salamander Innisbrook, LLC 
 Palm Harbor, Florida 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Salamander Innisbrook, LLC (the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations and changes in member s equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Amortization Period of Full Golf Membership Initiation Fees 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter, in any way, our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Description of Matter 
 As described further in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue for membership initiation fees over time based on the estimated average life of a membership. Management uses a ten-year amortization period to recognize membership initiation fees for full golf members. 
 
 20 

Table of Contents 

Management made significant judgments when determining the estimated average life of full golf memberships based on historical information of former and existing full golf members. As a result, a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort was required in performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 Our principal audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 
 
 We obtained an understanding of the various types of memberships and the process for recognizing revenue over the amortization period. 

We assessed management s estimate of average life of full golf memberships based on historical data for cancelled and existing memberships. 

We performed procedures to test the accuracy and completeness of the information used to assess the reasonableness of the amortization period.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

 Palm Harbor, Florida 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the Distribution Fund and the Maintenance Fund of the Innisbrook Rental Pool Lease Operation (the Rental Pool (funds created for participants who have entered into a rental pool agreement as explained in Note 1) as of December 31,2023and 2022, and the related statements of operations and changes in participants fund balances of the Distribution Fund and statements of changes in participants fund balances of the Maintenance Escrow Fund for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Rental Pool as of December 31,2023and 2022, and the results of its operations and changes in participants fund balances for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Rental Pool s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Rental Pool s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Rental Pool in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Rental Pool is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Rental Pool s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

The balances owed, along with the incentives discussed in the following paragraph, are reflected as a Rental Pool liability in the consolidated balance sheets of the Resort. The amounts were paid in 2024 and 2023, respectively. On August 20, 2018, the Second Addendum to the Master Lease Agreement became effective. The addendum defined the Turn-Key renovation, the customization of certain units that did not require a full renovation and provided for an incentive payment plan Incentive to be paid to Participants.

The first option provided that the Company would fund the cost overruns in exchange for the Participating Owner s dedication of their unit to the Rental Pool as evidenced by a Memorandum of Lease recorded against the title of such participant s unit in the land records of Pinellas County. The second option provided an additional incentive payment equal to the cost overrun amount in the form of quarterly payments,adjusted annually, resulting in a reimbursement of of the total amount in 2019, in 2020, in 2021, in 2022, and the remainder in 2023.

of the Occupancy Fees earned by each Participant are deposited in the Participant s Maintenance Escrow Fund account. Beginning in 2011, by mutual agreement between the LAC and the Resort, until it is determined that the fund requires replenishment, both the occupancy fee and the carpet care reserve deposit amounts will be . This account provides funds for payment of amounts that are due from Participants under the Agreement for maintenance and refurbishment services. Should a Participant s balance fall below that necessary to provide adequate funds for maintenance and replacements, the Participant is required to restore the escrow balance to a defined minimum level. The MLA provides for specific fund balances to be maintained, by unit type, size and age of refurbishment, as defined in the Agreement. Under the MLA, a percentage of the occupancy fees are deposited into the carpet care reserve in the Maintenance Escrow Fund, which bears the expenses of carpet cleaning for all Participants. This percentage is estimated to provide the amount necessary to fund carpet cleaning expenses and may be adjusted annually. The amounts expended for carpet care were approximately and for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The LAC invests the maintenance escrow funds on behalf of the Participants and in compliance with restrictions in the Agreements. The LAC consists of nine Participants elected to advise the Resort owner in Rental Pool matters and negotiate amendments to the lease agreement. Income earned on these investments is allocated proportionately to Participants Maintenance Escrow Fund accounts and paid quarterly. New Accounting Standard and Allowance for Credit Losses - In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance (FASB ASC 326) which significantly changed how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income. The most significant change in this standard is a shift from the incurred loss model to the expected loss model that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology. Under the standard, disclosures are required to provide users of the financial statements with useful information in analyzing an entity s exposure to credit risk and the measurement of credit losses. Among other things, the measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including held-to-maturity securities. No adjustments were necessary to the Rental Pool s allowance for credit losses because of the adoption of this standard and therefore the impact of this standard on our financial statements primarily resulted in disclosures only. Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities on a collective basis by major security types that share similar risk characteristics, which may include, but is not limited to, credit ratings, financial asset type, collateral type, size, effective interest rate, term, geographical location, industry, and vintage. Disclosure is required to be by portfolio segment or major security type. All the Rental Pool s held-to-maturity securities are in U.S. government obligations. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Rental Pool has evaluated and determined zero risk of nonpayment on all securities guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies and therefore no allowance for credit losses on these securities was and/or is deemed necessary.
