In addition, although the Company does not currently have any customers that would be considered individually significant to consolidated sales, changes in the distribution of the Company's products or the potential loss of one or more of the Company's larger customers are also considered risk factors. Matthews cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not all inclusive. Readers are also cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements, which reflect management's analysis only as of the date of this report, even if subsequently made available by Matthews on its website or otherwise.

 Included in this report are measures of financial performance that are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures assist management in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's core operations. For additional information and reconciliations from the consolidated financial statements see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in Item 7 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

The Company manages its business under three reporting segments, Memorialization, Industrial Technologies, and SGK Brand Solutions. The following table sets forth reported sales for the Company's business segments for the past three fiscal years. Detailed financial information relating to business segments and to domestic and international operations is presented in Note 21, "Segment Information" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data."

 In fiscal 2024, approximately 66 of the Company's sales were made from North America, 29 were made from Europe, 4 were made from Asia, and 1 were made from other regions. For further information on segments, see Note 21, "Segment Information" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Memorialization segment products are sold throughout the world, with the segment's principal operations located in North America, Europe, and Australia. The Industrial Technologies segment sells equipment and consumables directly to industrial consumers and distributors in North America and internationally through the Company's subsidiaries in Sweden, Germany and China, and other foreign distributors. Matthews owns a minority interest in Industrial Technologies product distributors in Asia, Australia and Europe. Products and services of the SGK Brand Solutions segment are sold throughout the world, with principal locations in North America, Europe and Asia. 
 
 Memorialization: 
 
 The Memorialization segment manufactures and markets a full line of memorialization products used primarily in cemeteries, funeral homes and crematories. The segment's products, which are sold principally in North America, Europe and Australia, include cast bronze memorials, granite memorials, caskets, cremation-related products, cremation and incineration equipment and other memorialization products. The segment also manufactures and markets architectural products that are used to identify or commemorate people, places, events and accomplishments. 
 
 Memorial products include flush bronze and granite memorials, upright granite memorials and monuments, concrete burial vaults, cremation memorialization products, granite benches, flower vases, crypt plates and letters, cremation urns, niche units, cemetery features and statues, along with other related products and services. Flush memorials are bronze plaques or granite memorials that contain personal information about a deceased individual (such as name, birth date and death date), photos and emblems. Flush bronze and granite memorials are even or "flush" with the ground and therefore are preferred by many cemeteries for easier lawn mowing and general maintenance. The segment's memorial products also include community and family mausoleums within North America. The segment's other memorial products include bronze plaques, letters, emblems, vases, lights and photo ceramics that can be affixed to granite monuments, mausoleums, crypts and flush memorials. Principal customers for memorial products are cemeteries, memorial parks and monument dealers, which in turn sell the Company's products to the consumer. 
 
 The Memorialization segment sells a full line of cremation-related products, including cremation urns in a variety of sizes, styles and shapes, as well as standard and custom designed granite cremation pedestals and benches. Manufactured bronze and granite niche units are comprised of numerous compartments used to display cremation urns in mausoleums and churches. The Company also markets turnkey cremation gardens that include design and all related products for a cremation memorial garden. 
 
 Customers of the Memorialization segment can purchase memorials and vases on a "pre-need" basis. This concept permits families to arrange for these purchases in advance of their actual need. Upon request, the Company will manufacture the memorial to the customer's specifications (e.g., name and birth date) and place it in storage for future delivery. Memorials in storage have been paid in full with title conveyed to each pre-need purchaser. 
 
 The segment is a leading manufacturer and distributor of caskets and other funeral home products in North America, producing and marketing metal, wood and cremation caskets. Caskets are offered in a variety of colors, interior designs, handles and trim in order to accommodate specific religious, ethnic or other personal preferences and can also be personalized. Other specialized funeral home products such as urns, jewelry, interior panels, and stationery are also offered.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS, (continued) 

Metal caskets are made from various gauges of cold-rolled steel, stainless steel, copper and bronze. Metal caskets are generally categorized by whether the casket is non-gasketed or gasketed, and by material (i.e., bronze, copper, or steel) and in the case of steel, by the gauge (thickness) of the metal. Wood caskets are primarily manufactured from nine different species of wood. The species of wood used are poplar, pine, ash, oak, pecan, maple, cherry, walnut and mahogany. The Memorialization segment is a leading manufacturer of all-wood constructed caskets, which are manufactured using pegged and dowelled construction, and include no metal parts. Cremation caskets are made primarily from wood or cardboard covered with cloth or veneer. These caskets appeal primarily to cremation consumers, environmentally concerned consumers and value buyers. 
 
 The Memorialization segment produces casket components, which include stamped metal parts, metal locking mechanisms for gasketed metal caskets and adjustable beds. Metal casket parts are produced by stamping cold-rolled steel, stainless steel, copper and bronze sheets into casket component parts. Locking mechanisms and adjustable beds are produced by stamping and assembling a variety of steel parts. The segment purchases various species of uncured wood from sawmills and lumber distributors, which it dries and cures before being processed into casket components. 
 
 The segment provides product and service assortment planning, as well as merchandising and display products to funeral service businesses. The Memorialization segment develops and sells technology solutions that help funeral homes manage their businesses and serve families through these digital platforms. Solutions are delivered as software as a service and include funeral home management systems and web-based arrangement and presentation systems. These products assist funeral service professionals in providing information, value and satisfaction to their client families. 
 
 The segment offers cremation systems, crematory management, and cremation service and supplies to the pet and human sector, and standard and specialized incineration systems, including abated filtration systems to satisfy strict environmental requirements. The primary market areas for these products and services are North America and Europe, although the segment also sells into Latin America and the Caribbean, Australia, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. 
 
 Cremation systems include flame-based systems for cremation of humans and pets, as well as equipment for processing the cremated remains and other related equipment (ventilated workstations, loading systems, tables, cooler racks, vacuums). The principal markets for these products are funeral homes, cemeteries, crematories, pet crematories, animal disposers and veterinarians. These products primarily are marketed directly by segment personnel. Human crematory management/operations represent the actual operation and management of client-owned crematories. Cremation service and supplies consist of operator training, preventative maintenance and on-demand service work performed on various makes and models of equipment. This work can be as simple as replacing defective bulbs or as complex as complete reconstruction and upgrading or retrofitting on site. Supplies are consumable items and replacement parts associated with normal crematory operations. 
 
 Waste incineration systems encompass both batch load and continuous feed, static, stepped-hearth and rotary systems for incineration of many waste types, as well as equipment for in-loading waste, out-loading ash and energy recovery. The principal markets for these products are animal and medical waste disposal, oil and gas "work camp" wastes, industrial wastes and bio-mass generators, as well as destruction of low-volume, high-value waste types such as contraband and pharmaceutical products. Environmental and energy systems include emissions filtration units, waste heat recovery equipment, waste gas treatment products, as well as energy recovery. The segment also provides commissioning, training and user support for customers of incineration systems. The principal markets are municipalities or public/state agencies, the cremation industry and other industries that utilize incinerators for waste reduction and energy production. 
 
 Architectural products include cast bronze and aluminum plaques, etchings and letters that are used to recognize, commemorate and identify people, places, events and accomplishments. The Company's plaques are frequently used to identify the name of a building, or the names of companies or individuals located within a building. Such products are also used to commemorate events or accomplishments, such as military service or financial donations. The principal markets for the segment's architectural products are corporations, fraternal organizations, contractors, churches, hospitals, schools and government agencies. These products are sold to and distributed through a network of independent dealers including sign suppliers, awards and recognition companies, and trophy dealers.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS, (continued) 

Raw materials used by the Memorialization segment to manufacture memorials consist principally of bronze and aluminum ingot, granite, sheet metal, coating materials, photopolymers and construction materials and are generally available in adequate supply. Ingot is obtained from various North American, European and Australian smelters. The primary materials required for casket manufacturing are cold-rolled steel and lumber. The segment also purchases copper, bronze, stainless steel, particleboard, corrugated materials, paper veneer, cloth, ornamental hardware and coating materials. Purchase orders or supply agreements are typically negotiated with steel suppliers that have demonstrated timely delivery, high quality material and competitive prices. Lumber is purchased from a number of sawmills and lumber distributors. Raw materials used to manufacture cremation and incineration products consist principally of structural steel, sheet metal, electrical components, combustion devices and refractory materials. These are generally available in adequate supply from numerous suppliers. 
 
 Competition from other manufacturers of memorial products is based on reputation, product quality, delivery, price, and design availability. The Company believes that its superior quality, broad product lines, innovative designs, delivery capability, customer responsiveness, experienced personnel and consumer-oriented merchandising systems are competitive advantages in its markets. Competition in the mausoleum construction industry includes various construction companies throughout North America and is based on design, quality and price. Competitors in the architectural market are numerous and include companies that manufacture cast and painted signs, plastic materials, sand-blasted wood and other fabricated products. 
 
 The Memorialization segment markets its casket products in the United States through a combination of Company-owned and independent casket distribution facilities. The segment's casket products are primarily sold through Company-owned distribution centers throughout the United States. The casket business is highly competitive and the Company competes with other manufacturers based on product quality, price, service, design availability and breadth of product line. The Memorialization segment provides a line of casket products that it believes is as comprehensive as any of its major competitors. There are a large number of casket industry participants operating in North America, and a few foreign casket manufacturers, primarily from China, participating in the North American market. 
 
 The Company competes with several manufacturers in the cremation and accessory equipment market principally based on product design, quality and price. The Memorialization segment and its three largest global competitors account for a substantial portion of the United States and European cremation equipment market. 
 
 The Memorialization segment works to provide a total solution to customers that own and operate businesses in both the cemetery and funeral home markets. The Company's memorial and casket products serve the relatively stable casketed and in-ground burial death market, while its memorial products and cremation and incineration equipment also serve the growing cremation market. 
 
 Industrial Technologies: 
 
 The Industrial Technologies segment includes the design, manufacturing, service and sales of high-tech custom energy storage solutions; product identification and warehouse automation technologies and solutions, including order fulfillment systems for identifying, tracking, picking and conveying consumer and industrial products; and coating and converting lines for the packaging, pharma, foil, d cor and tissue industries. 
 
 The energy storage solutions business produces engineered calendering, laminating, and coating equipment used in the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries and components of fuel cells. The segment currently delivers products to major vehicle producers and tier 1 battery manufacturers. The segment also offers service, spare parts, calender- and coating-roller refurbishing and retrofits of complete production lines. 
 
 The coating and converting solutions business produces both complete production lines and individual units for drying, treating, coating, laminating and winding for the packaging, paper, labeling and foil industry as well as technical textiles and pharma industry but also for embossing, finishing, smoothing, perforating and calibrating web materials. The business supplies high-tech machines to large global customers and develops solutions collaboratively with them to make their processes more resource-efficient and their products more sustainable. 
 
 Production capabilities are available in Germany, the Czech Republic and the United States, with design and assembly in Germany, Switzerland, Czech Republic and the United States. The business is globally active with well-established customer relations. 
 
 5 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS, (continued) 

The energy storage solutions business has grown over the last few years, primarily reflecting demand for batteries for use in electric vehicles. The segment has over a decade of experience in developing dry electrode battery solutions. Dry electrode technology makes producing lithium-ion batteries less expensive than the wet electrode process, and is also more environmentally sustainable. These factors could contribute to increased utilization of dry electrode batteries in the electric vehicle market, and thus greater demand for this form of battery production in the future. 
 
 Product identification systems range from stand-alone marking products to complex ink-jet printing systems that integrate into a customer's production process. The Company manufactures and markets products and systems that employ different marking technologies, including laser and ink-jet printing. These technologies apply product information required for identification and traceability, as well as to facilitate inventory and quality control, regulatory compliance and brand name communication. The segment also develops innovative, custom solutions to address specific customer requirements in a variety of industries, including oil field services and security scanning. 
 
 Warehouse automation systems complement the tracking and distribution of a customer's products with automated order fulfillment technologies, and controls for material handling systems. Material handling customers include some of the largest retail, e-commerce, and third-party logistics companies in the United States. 
 
 A portion of the revenue of the Industrial Technologies segment is attributable to the sale of consumables and replacement parts required by the marking, coding and tracking products sold by Matthews. The Company develops inks exclusively for the use with its marking equipment, which is critical to ensure ongoing equipment reliability and mark quality. 
 
 The principal customers for the Company's marking and fulfillment systems products are manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of durable goods, building products, consumer goods manufacturers (including food and beverage processors) and producers of pharmaceuticals. The Company also serves a wide variety of industrial markets, including metal fabricators, manufacturers of woven and non-woven fabrics, plastic, rubber and automotive products. 
 
 A portion of this segment's sales are outside the United States, sourced through the Company's subsidiaries in Sweden, Germany, Malaysia and China in addition to other international distributors. The Company owns a minority interest in distributors in Asia, Australia and Europe. 
 
 Major raw materials for this segment's products include precision components, electronics, printing components, chemicals, steel, copper, and film all of which are presently available in adequate supply from various sources. 
 
 Competitors in the marking and fulfillment systems industries are diverse, with some companies offering limited product lines for well-defined specialty markets, while others operate similarly to the Company, offering a broad product line and competing in multiple product markets and countries. Competitive differentiation for marking and fulfillment systems products is based on product performance, ease of integration into the manufacturing and/or distribution process, service and price. The Company typically competes with specialty companies in specific brand marking solutions and traceability applications. In the energy storage solutions business, the Company has patents and pending patent applications on its dry electrode calendering equipment. The Company believes that, in general, its Industrial Technologies segment offers one of the broadest lines of products to address a wide variety of high-tech custom energy storage solutions, product identification and warehouse automation applications. 
 
 SGK Brand Solutions: 
 
 The SGK Brand Solutions segment provides packaging and brand experience solutions that simplify marketing, amplify brands and deliver value. Matthews has more than 100 years in the packaging business, which is comprised of broad technical, engineering, and artistic expertise relating to the creation and production of graphics, their workflows and best practices for the commercial packaging and retail channels. This combination of knowledge, experience and skill helps the SGK Brand Solutions segment differentiate itself from competitors. 
 
 The SGK Brand Solutions segment helps companies to define, create, produce and transform their packaging and marketing supply chains and the brand assets that flow through them. By simplifying marketing, the segment helps deliver greater speed through workflow efficiency, enabling clients to get new product introductions and campaigns to market faster which can result in a competitive advantage for the brand. By amplifying brands, the segment helps brands create meaningful experiences online and offline that enable them to stand out in the marketplace which can result in a stronger connection between consumers and the brand. The SGK Brand Solutions segment also helps clients deliver improved marketing productivity and profitability through innovative technology solutions. 
 6 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS, (continued) 

The packaging solutions part of its business integrates all packaging-related services from the beginning to the end of the packaging development workflow process. Clients may purchase stand-alone services or a combination of services that are designed to fulfill larger, more strategic objectives. These services include design and adaptive packaging design, production art, photography, retouching, the creation of e-commerce assets, premedia, print technical services, cylinder and flexo printing plate production, workflow efficiency consulting, change management and technology workflow solutions. Historically a print media based business, the business leverages their 100+ years of packaging expertise to create packaging assets required for the e-commerce channel. The business has evolved from creating and delivering graphic brand assets for a single medium (package on shelf) which required output for printing, into one that is deeply entrenched in a brand s journey across multiple mediums, requiring an almost infinite array of digital asset output across an ever-expanding multi-channel universe. 
 
 The brand experience part of the business integrates all marketing-related services from the beginning to the end of the marketing development workflow process. Clients may purchase stand-alone services or a combination of services that are designed to fulfill larger, more strategic objectives. These services include all the services that help create brand experiences: consumer insights, brand strategy, brand identity, content marketing strategy, marketing content creation, campaign strategy and development, online and in-store retail experiences and merchandising fabrication, creative process management and technology workflow solutions. Largely, an ideation and digital media-based business, the business leverages its branding expertise to drive the creation of digital experiences that stick with consumers. 
 
 The SGK Brand Solutions segment s principal clients are global, multinational and regional companies in highly regulated industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceutical and healthcare, beauty and cosmetics, and alcohol and tobacco. The segment also serves clients in a diverse range of sectors that includes leaders in home improvement, personal care, technology and electronics, snack food and confections, telecommunications, and apparel, as well as a diverse range of shopping formats that include big-box stores, department stores, specialty stores, grocery stores, pharmacy chains and online retailers. These large, well-known companies represent a variety of brands across the marketplace covering both national and private label brands with numerous packaging and marketing requirements. The segment is also a leading international supplier of pre-press, rotogravure and embossing tooling, with principal clients representing brand manufacturers, printers and converters. 
 
 The segment s products, services and solutions are purchased in part or whole by companies with operations in and/or across the North America, Europe and Asia regions. A large portion of these purchases result in annual or multi-year contracts; others are initiative-based. The segment generates new business opportunities through referrals and relationships, marketing and lead generation and select industry partnerships. The Company has many long-standing relationships among its client base that span decades and has new relationships with well-known global technology companies that are driving change in how consumers engage with brands and use devices like smartphones to shop and buy online and in-store. 
 
 Major raw materials for this segment s products include photopolymers, steel, copper, film, wood, corrugated materials, structural steel, plastic, laminates, inks and graphic art supplies. All such materials are presently available in adequate supply from various industry sources. Competition is on the basis of product quality, timeliness of delivery and price, and increasingly, the ability to provide a holistic solution for brand content beyond its use for packaging, while at the same time elevating the role of packaging in the marketing mix. The segment's ability to offer consistent service on a global basis is a key differentiator. 
 
 The segment competes in an industry that is constantly challenged by emerging technologies that impact packaging and marketing. These challenges have created new opportunities for the segment to create, produce and manage large volumes of brand content in an automated manner, which has generated incremental revenues from standalone software-as-a-service SaaS sales. They also provide the segment with opportunities to advise its clients on how to plan for, manage and execute the digital transformation of their packaging and marketing operations. Increasingly, with the growing awareness and commitment by its clients to environmental sustainability, the SGK Brand Solutions segment is providing solutions that enable its clients to advance their own sustainability initiatives. 
 
 PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES: 
 
 The Company holds a number of trademarks and in excess of 100 domestic and foreign patents for its products and related technologies. In addition, the Company maintains numerous trade secrets that further comprise its portfolio of intellectual property assets. The Company continues to assess, refine and expand its intellectual property portfolio, considering options to pursue additional patent filings and to further develop and continue to maintain processes to identify, inventory and safeguard evolving trade secrets and other intellectual property assets. The Company also enters into agreements with customers that authorizes the use of certain intellectual property through various licensing arrangements.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS, (continued) 

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES: 
 
 Introduction:

 Matthews is committed to fostering a culture of continuous learning and development, ensuring all employees have the resources and support they need to succeed. 
 
 Succession Management: 
 
 The Company s future success depends upon tomorrow s leaders. Succession Planning for senior leaders is a key focus area built on the foundation of a structured talent review process for identifying the key roles critical to future success, and the key talent to achieve success. The outputs of this annual process are presented first to the executive team, who then selects a cohort of future leaders to participate in comprehensive leadership programs designed to prepare leaders for enterprise roles, and then presented to the Matthews Board of Directors. The Company believes this investment, which includes classroom learning, assessments, coaching/mentoring and real time strategic project application, both strengthens the organization for the future, while deepening the commitment of its top talent with prepared, ready talent to assume senior roles. 
 
 Performance Management: 
 
 Connecting employees to the Company's strategy ensures individual effort to a larger goal and strengthens commitment to the organization. The Company supports an annual leadership strategy cascade where each segment, division, group and team identify and align goals and objectives which serve as the basis for individual performance objectives, keeping employees firmly connected to the work and the Company s collective success. This process is rooted in ongoing coaching and feedback, and measures not just what was accomplished, but how it was accomplished because Matthews believes staying true to its values and key behaviors serves clients better, strengthens culture and keeps employees engaged. 
 
 Change Management: 
 
 Matthews is a constantly evolving multi-national company, leveraging new ways of working to improve its quality, service and delivery systems to better help customers and clients succeed. Building change capability to support employees through changes accelerates new ways of working, minimizes productivity loss, and accelerates adoption of innovations and improvement measures. The Company has a trained global change network embedded in the business to support transformational projects to help realize the goals and benefits of organizational changes. 
 
 Environmental, Health and Safety: 
 
 The Company s leadership team is committed to integrating Environmental, Health, and Safety ("EHS") principles into the Company's business strategy and operations, as it is one of the Company s core values. Matthews continually improves its EHS management system and performance by setting measurable EHS objectives and targets, regularly reviewing progress, and implementing corrective actions when necessary. A safe and healthy work environment can only be achieved through active participation. Employees at all levels are encouraged and empowered to report hazards, participate in safety programs, and suggest improvements. 
 
 BACKLOG: 
 
 The Company's current backlog is expected to be substantially filled in fiscal 2025. Cremation and incineration equipment sales backlogs vary in a range of four to six months of sales. Backlogs vary in a range of approximately twelve to eighteen months of sales for mausoleums. Backlogs are generally in excess of a year for purpose-built machinery projects. Backlogs for warehouse automation and fulfillment systems generally vary in a range of up to four weeks for standard products, and are currently in the range of ten to twelve months for custom systems.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS, (continued) 

REGULATORY MATTERS: 
 
 The Company s operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations requiring strict compliance, including, but not limited to, the protection of the environment. The Company has established numerous internal compliance programs to further ensure lawful satisfaction of the applicable regulations. In addition, the Company is party to specific environmental matters which include obligations to investigate and mitigate the effects on the environment of certain materials at operating and non-operating sites. The Company is currently performing environmental assessments and remediation at certain sites, as applicable. 
 
 AVAILABLE INFORMATION: 
 
 The Company's principal executive offices are located at Two NorthShore Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212, its telephone number is (412) 442-8200 and its website is www.matw.com. The Company files or furnishes all required reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in accordance with the Exchange Act. The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports are available free of charge on the Company's website as soon as reasonably practicable after being filed or furnished to the SEC. The Company's reports filed or furnished with the SEC, including exhibits attached to such reports, are also available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 
 There are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's businesses that could adversely affect its operating performance and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that the Company believes to be material as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not known to the Company as of such date or risks that the Company deemed immaterial may also result in adverse effects on the Company in the future. 
 
 Company-Specific Risk Factors: 
 
 The Company's international sales and operations expose the Company to significant risks and failure to manage those risks could materially adversely impact the Company's business. The Company conducts business in more than 30 countries around the world, and in fiscal 2024 approximately 36 of the Company's sales were made from locations outside the United States. In addition, the Company's manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world. As such, the Company's future success depends in part on its ability to grow sales in non-U.S. markets. Sales and operations outside of the United States are subject to certain inherent risks. The Company anticipates that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of its revenues. Risks associated with the Company s international sales and operations include, but are not limited to: 
 
 currency exchange rate fluctuations; 
 global political and economic instability and uncertainty; 
 international terrorism; 
 export controls, including by the United States; 
 failure to comply with anti-bribery legislation, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA 
 changes in legal and regulatory requirements; 
 policy changes by the United States and foreign governments affecting the markets for the Company s products; 
 changes in tax laws, quotas, tariffs and other market barriers; 
 difficulties in protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights; 
 restrictions on the export or import of technology; 
 failure to comply with the foreign data protection laws, including the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR ; 
 failure to comply with foreign sustainability-related reporting requirements, including the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive; 
 inadvertent transfers of export-controlled information due to increased cross-border technology transfers and the use of offshore computer servers; 
 transportation, including piracy in international waters; and 
 challenges relating to managing a global workforce with diverse cultures, backgrounds and labor laws. 
 
 10 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued) 

 It also is possible that certain international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations (known as offset obligations) and may provide for penalties if the Company fails to meet such requirements. 
 
 The impact of these risks is difficult to predict, but the occurrence of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the Company's revenue, cash flows and financial results. Production and sales of a significant portion of the Company's products are outside the United States, and accordingly, the Company holds assets, incurs liabilities, earns revenue and pays expenses in a variety of currencies. The Company's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and therefore, the Company must translate the reported values of its foreign assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in the Company's consolidated financial statements, even though their value has not changed in local currency. 
 
 Interest rate fluctuations could increase the Company's financing costs and reduce the Company's ability to obtain additional indebtedness or debt refinancing, which could materially and adversely affect the Company. Interest rate fluctuations could increase the Company's financing costs to the extent such interest rates are not hedged. In addition, increases in interest rates could limit the Company's ability to obtain additional indebtedness or debt refinancing on terms that the Company deems attractive, or at all, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's borrowing costs, profitability, liquidity and capital resources. Borrowings under the Company s credit facilities, including the domestic credit facility, are subject to variable rates of interest and expose the Company to interest rate risk. The Company enters into interest rate swaps in order to achieve a mix of fixed and variable rate debt that it deems appropriate. To the extent that some or all of the Company s variable interest rate debt is not subject to interest rate swaps, if interest rates were to increase, the Company s interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments. 
 
 The Company also has 300.0 million 8.625 senior secured second lien notes due October 1, 2027 (the "2027 Senior Secured Notes"). In the event the Company seeks to refinance indebtedness under the domestic credit facility or the 2027 Senior Secured Notes, or obtain additional financing, higher interest rates may limit the Company s ability to incur such indebtedness on terms that it deems attractive, if at all. If the Company is unable to incur indebtedness on terms that it deems attractive, it could have a material and adverse effect on the Company s borrowing costs, profitability, liquidity and capital resources. 
 
 Increased prices for raw materials or shortages could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows. The Company's profitability is affected by the prices of the raw materials used in the manufacture of its products. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including changes in supply and demand, domestic and global economic conditions, volatility in commodity markets, currency exchange rates, labor costs, tariffs and fuel-related costs. If suppliers increase the price of critical raw materials, alternative sources of supply, or alternative materials, may not exist or be readily available. In addition, disruptions in the global supply chain may cause prices for raw materials to increase. See "The Company faces additional global supply chain risks and risks of interruption of requisite logistics and transportation services, including as a result of the Company's reliance on limited suppliers and vendors for certain components, materials, and services." 
 
 The Company has standard selling price structures (i.e., list prices) in certain of its segments, which are reviewed for adjustment generally on an annual basis. In addition, the Company has established pricing terms with several of its customers through contracts or similar arrangements. Based on competitive market conditions and to the extent that the Company has established pricing terms with customers, the Company's ability to immediately increase the price of its products to offset the increased costs may be limited. Significant raw material price increases that cannot be mitigated by selling price increases or productivity improvements will negatively affect the Company's results of operations. 
 
 11 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued) 

 The Company's balance sheet includes a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact the Company's consolidated results of operations and total assets. The Company has recorded a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets in its consolidated financial statements resulting from acquisition activities and has in the past recorded, and may in the future record, significant charges for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The Company tests, at least annually, the carrying value of goodwill for impairment. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. For example, during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2022, Matthews recorded a 16.7 million goodwill write-down with respect to its Surfaces and Engineering reporting unit and an 82.5 million goodwill write-down with respect to its SGK Brand Solutions reporting unit, respectively. See Note 23, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details. If Matthews concludes that any further goodwill or intangible asset values are impaired, for reasons that may include, but are not limited to, underperformance in one or more reporting segments against forecast levels; changes in the Company s business strategy, structure, and/or the allocation of resources; the inability of acquisitions to achieve expected operating results; a decline in the Company s stock price for a sustained period; a potential recession or other disruption; or interest rate increases or other factors, any resulting non-cash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on Matthews business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Changes in mortality and cremation rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's cash flows and revenues. Generally, life expectancy in the United States and other countries in which the Company's Memorialization segment operates has increased steadily for several decades and is expected to continue to do so in the future, absent events related to pandemics or similar outbreaks. The increase in life expectancy is also expected to impact the timing of deaths in the future. Additionally, cremations have steadily grown as a percentage of total deaths in the United States since the 1960's, and are expected to continue to increase in the future. The Company expects that these trends will continue in the future and sales of the Company's Memorialization segment may benefit from the continued growth in the number of cremations; however, such trends may adversely affect the volume of bronze and granite memorialization products and burial caskets sold in the United States. 
 
 The Company is subject to competitive pressures, including with respect to product demand and pricing. The Company's businesses have and will continue to operate in competitive markets. Changes in product demand or pricing are affected by domestic and foreign competition and an increase in consolidated purchasing by large customers operating in both domestic and global markets. The Memorialization businesses generally operate in markets with ample supply capacity and demand which is correlated to death rates. The SGK Brand Solutions businesses serve global customers that are requiring their suppliers to be global in scope and price-competitive. Additionally, in recent years the Company has witnessed an increase in products manufactured offshore, primarily in China, and imported into the Company's U.S. markets. It is expected that these trends will continue and may affect the Company's future results of operations. 
 
 The loss of any of the Company's large customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's cash flows and results of operations. Although the Company does not have any customer that is individually significant to consolidated sales, it does have contracts with several large customers in each of its business segments. While these contracts provide important access to large purchasers of the Company's products, they can obligate the Company to sell products at contracted prices for extended periods of time, or, in the event of a dispute with a large customer, cause disruptions to the units sold to such customer, if any. Additionally, any significant divestiture of business properties or operations by current customers could result in a loss of business if the Company is not able to maintain the business with the subsequent owners of the businesses. 
 
 The Company faces additional global supply chain risks and risks of interruption of requisite logistics and transportation services, including as a result of the Company's reliance on limited suppliers and vendors for certain components, materials, and services. The Company purchases components and materials to manufacture its products from a large number of suppliers, some of which may be critical to operations. The Company s product offerings are impacted by such suppliers' lead times, volume constraints and increasing costs. The Company has experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times and product unavailability due to manufacturing disruptions or closures as well as delays and unanticipated costs associated with the sourcing of materials. Matthews supply chain operations span several geographies globally and are heavily dependent upon third party logistics and transportation services to deliver the Company s products to customers. Extended lead times and shortages could impair the Company s ability to meet its customer requirements, require the Company to pay higher prices or incur expedite fees or cause its customers to delay or forgo projects, which would harm Matthews business and negatively impact the Company s gross margin and results of operations. 
 
 12 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued) 

 Pandemics or similar outbreaks may cause unfavorable economic or market conditions, which could impact demand patterns, access to capital and/or disrupt global supply chains and manufacturing operations. Pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely affect the economies of developed and emerging markets, potentially resulting in an economic downturn that could affect customers demand for the Company s products and services, as well as the Company's ability to access capital at acceptable interest rates. The spread of pandemics or similar outbreaks may also disrupt the Company s manufacturing and production operations, as well as its distribution systems, which include import and export for delivery of the Company s products to its customers. These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. See also "The Company faces additional global supply chain risks and risks of interruption of requisite logistics and transportation services, including as a result of the Company's reliance on limited suppliers and vendors for certain components, materials, and services." 
 
 Due to the uncertainty relating to a pandemic or similar outbreak, the Company, its customers or its suppliers may be required, or believe that it is advantageous, to take precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of a virus or disease spreading to employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate, and these measures could negatively impact the Company s business. Further, if the scope and severity of an outbreak worsens and the Company s contingency plans prove ineffective, its global operations could potentially experience disruptions, such as temporary closure of facilities or delays or suspensions in product offerings and services, which may materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Global conflicts may impact the Company's business and the markets in which the Company operates. Global conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, could impact the Company and its operations in a number of different ways, which are yet to be fully assessed and are therefore uncertain. The Company s principal concern is for the safety of its employees and other personnel, specifically those who are based in the affected region. The Company has employees who are based in Eastern Europe, including Russia and Ukraine, who may be affected by the ongoing hostilities. The Company additionally has property, plant and equipment in or around the affected region. The continuing impact of this war and the response of the United States and other countries to it by means of trade and economic sanctions, or other actions, is still evolving and unknown; however it could disrupt the Company s ability to work with certain parties. Similarly, the Company has employees based in the affected region and works with third-party providers from other parts of the world that may be affected by hostilities. 
 
 Due to the uncertainty relating to war or similar conflicts, the current war between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect the Company's business, of which could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and business and consumer spending; disruptions to the Company's global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack, ransom attack, or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; disruptions in global supply chains; exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets. Similar uncertainties may arise in connection with other ongoing hostilities or future hostilities. 
 
 For so long as the hostilities continue, and perhaps even thereafter as the situation unfolds, the Company may see increased volatility in financial markets, which may impact equity markets generally, including the Company s stock price, and make it more difficult for the Company to raise additional capital at a strategically advantageous time, or for financing to be available upon acceptable terms. All or any of these risks separately, or in combination could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 The Company faces risks in connection with acquisitions, divestitures and business combinations, including the Company's ability to identify or successfully complete any such acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations, to effectively integrate acquired businesses or to effectively manage the remaining business or the combined business. The Company has grown, in part, through acquisitions and continues to evaluate acquisition, divestiture and business combination opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen its businesses, and any such future acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations may be material. There is no assurance, however, that future acquisition, divestiture or business combination opportunities will arise, or that if they do, that they will be consummated. In addition, acquisition, divestitures and business combinations involve inherent risks that the businesses acquired, or the combined or remaining business, will not perform in accordance with expectations, or that synergies expected from an acquisition, divestiture or business combination will not be achieved as rapidly as expected, or at all. The Company's pre-transaction diligence review may not discover or accurately quantify certain undisclosed liabilities, and the Company may not be indemnified for such liabilities which could have an adverse effect on the acquired business, the remaining business or the combined business. Failure to effectively integrate acquired businesses or effectively manage the remaining business or the combined business could prevent the realization of expected rates of return on the investment, including the achievement of cost-reduction objectives, and could have a negative effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 13 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued) 

 If the Company is unable to adequately protect the Company's intellectual property, the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Certain of the Company's businesses rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish proprietary rights. If the Company does not enforce, or is unsuccessful in enforcing, its intellectual property rights successfully, its competitive position may suffer, which could harm the Company's operating results and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. In addition, the Company's patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, including its trade secrets, may not provide a significant competitive advantage. The Company may need to spend significant resources monitoring its intellectual property rights and may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. The Company's competitive position may be harmed if it cannot detect infringement and enforce its intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, the Company may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, such as the expense of litigation against a well-resourced adversary. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around the Company's intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and the Company's ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. 
 
 Intellectual property infringement assertions by third parties, including those of Tesla, could result in significant costs and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, operating results and reputation. The Company actively manages its businesses to ensure compliance under contractual commitments with its customers, including matters related to intellectual property rights. While the Company believes it has complied with its obligations in this regard and has not infringed on the intellectual property of third parties, the Company cannot assure that third parties will not assert claims, meritorious or otherwise. For example, while the Company has attempted to work under the terms of its existing contracts with Tesla to affirm the ownership of its intellectual property, in June 2024, Tesla filed a complaint against the Company (the Tesla Complaint alleging trade secret misappropriations under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (the DTSA and California s Uniform Trade Secrets Act (the CUTSA ), breach of contract and unfair business practices relating to the Company s dry battery electrode solutions. The Company cannot predict whether the assertions in the Tesla Complaint or other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising from such assertions would substantially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and operating results. The defense of these claims, including the Tesla Complaint, and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in the Company's favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute, including the dispute with Tesla, may require the Company to pay damages, cease making, licensing, or using products or offering services that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend additional development resources to redesign the Company's offerings, or enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary intellectual property, which may be unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in the Company's favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations, as well as environmental remediation and compliance that may lead to significant unforeseen expenses. The Company is subject to the risk of environmental liability and limitations on its operations due to environmental laws and regulations. The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning matters such as air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste handling and disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination. The risks of potentially substantial costs and liabilities related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of the Company's business, and future conditions may develop, arise or be discovered that create substantial environmental compliance or remediation liabilities and costs. Compliance with environmental, health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than the Company anticipates, and there is no assurance that significant expenditures related to such compliance may not be required in the future. 
 
 From time to time, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings brought by private parties or governmental authorities with respect to environmental matters, including matters involving alleged noncompliance with or liability under environmental, health and safety laws, property damage or personal injury. New laws and regulations, including those which may relate to emissions of greenhouse gases, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require the Company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. 

14 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued) 

 The Company relies on third parties and their systems for a variety of services, including significant information technology services, and the failure of these third parties to provide these services could disrupt the Company's business. The Company has entered into agreements with a variety of third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server maintenance, cloud computing and transaction processing services. In addition, Matthews has agreements through which it has outsourced certain activities related to the operations of the Company s business segments. A provider s ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including, among others, software errors or design faults, human error, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond their control. If one or more of Matthews providers is unable to provide adequate or timely services, the Company s ability to deliver products and services to customers could be adversely affected. Matthews cannot completely eliminate the risk of such disruptions, many of which are impacted by events outside of the Company s control. Any significant disruption could harm the Company s business, including damage to brands and loss of customers. Additionally, although Matthews believes that most of these services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of the providers could cause a material disruption in the Company s business and an increase in expense while it works to obtain alternative services. Additionally, while the Company has policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing the profiles of Matthews financial, legal, reputational and operational risks. 
 
 If the Company is unable to keep pace with technological changes, some of which are beyond the Company's control, the Company may not be able to maintain the Company's competitive position. The Company operates in certain markets in which technological product development contributes to its ability to compete effectively. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to develop new products, that new products can be manufactured and marketed profitably, or that new products will successfully meet the expectations of customers. 
 
 Changing laws and regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase the Company's costs, and the failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant business disruptions, litigation or enforcement actions. The Company is subject to many data privacy, data protection, and data breach notification laws, including the GDPR, which became effective in May of 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA"), which became effective in January 2020. The GDPR and the CCPA contain comprehensive data protection compliance requirements. Complying with the GDPR and the CCPA may continue to cause the Company to incur substantial operational costs or require the Company to change certain of its business practices in certain jurisdictions. The Company s measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with, the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as new and existing data-related laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, could be challenged, including by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. The Company s ongoing compliance measures could result in the incurrence of significant expense in facilitating and responding to regulatory investigations, and if the measures initiated by the Company are deemed to be inadequate, the Company could be subject to litigation or enforcement actions that may require operational changes, fines, penalties or damages, which could have an adverse impact on the Company s business or results of operations. 
 
 Future tax law changes and/or interpretation of existing tax laws may adversely affect the Company's effective income tax rate and require adjustments to the Company's tax estimates. Matthews is subject to domestic and international tax laws and cannot predict the scope or effect of future tax law changes. Domestically, the U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretive guidance. The Company has applied available guidance to estimate its tax obligations, but new guidance may cause the Company to make adjustments to its tax estimates in future periods. 
 
 The Company operates in a regulated environment that requires the Company's compliance with laws and regulations. Non-compliance could subject the Company to sanctions and materially adversely affect the Company's business. Due to the international scope of the Company's operations, Matthews is subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world, and the Company's foreign operations are governed by laws, rules and business practices that often differ from those of the United States. The Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which the Company's operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted, which could have a material and negative impact on the Company's business and results of operation. For example, recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws and regulations regarding trade compliance, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering, and anti-corruption, such as the FCPA and similar laws in other countries. While Matthews maintains a variety of internal policies and controls and takes steps, including periodic training and internal audits, that the Company believes are reasonably calculated to discourage, prevent and detect violations of such laws, the Company cannot guarantee that such actions will be effective or that individual employees will not engage in inappropriate behavior in contravention of the Company's policies and instructions. Such conduct, or even the allegation thereof, could result in costly investigations and the imposition of severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt the Company's business, and could materially and adversely affect the Company's reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.

 Further, the Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide affecting its operations outside the United States in areas including, but not limited to, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, customs, import and export requirements, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, pensions and social insurance, employment, and environment, health, and safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive and requirements may differ among jurisdictions. Further, the promulgation of new laws, changes in existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may have a negative impact on the Company's business and prospects. In addition, certain laws and regulations are relatively new and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainties. There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 General Risk Factors: 
 
 The Company's business is affected by general economic conditions, and any economic decline or other circumstances that result in reductions in the Company's customers spending could negatively impact the Company's sales volume and revenues. Generally, changes in domestic and international economic conditions affect the industries in which the Company and its customers and suppliers operate. These changes include changes in the rate of consumption or use of the Company's products due to economic downturns, volatility in currency exchange rates, and changes in raw material prices resulting from supply and/or demand conditions. 
 
 Uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk, as consumers and businesses may continue to postpone or cancel spending. Other factors that could influence customer spending include energy costs, conditions in the credit markets, consumer confidence, global pandemics, and other factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could have an effect on demand for the Company's products and services and negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company's results of operations could be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost increases. Labor is a significant component of the Company's operations. Several factors may adversely affect the labor force available to Matthews or increase labor costs (i.e., labor rates and overtime levels), including high employment levels, unemployment subsidies, increased wages offered by other employers, vaccine mandates and other government regulations and the Company s responses thereto. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover, or labor inflation, caused by pandemics or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on the Company s business and operating results. 
 
 The Company relies on information technology to operate the Company's business. Security breach incidents and breakdowns of information technologies, or failure to comply with laws governing data privacy and data protection, could disrupt the Company's operations, subject the Company to legal claims, and impact the Company's financial results. In the course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data and proprietary business information. The Company could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of the Company's network or data including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Although the Company is not aware of any significant incidents to date, if it is unable to prevent, detect and timely remediate such security or privacy breaches, its operations could be disrupted or the Company may suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. 
 
 The Company expects that compliance with laws governing data privacy and data protection will require ongoing investment in systems, policies and personnel and will continue to impact Matthews business in the future by increasing legal, operational and compliance costs. There can be no assurance that the Company s efforts will meet the evolving standards imposed by governmental and regulatory agencies, including data protection authorities, with respect to standards that may be adopted in the future. If the Company is found or suspected to have violated data privacy or data protection laws, it may be subject to potential private consumer, business partner or securities litigation, regulatory inquiries, governmental investigations and proceedings, and may incur damage to its reputation. Any such developments may subject Matthews to material fines and other monetary penalties and damages, divert management s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business and results of operations. 
 
 16 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued) 

 If the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level, the Company may not be able to accurately report the Company's financial results, and may require the restatement of previously published financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations, investor confidence in the Company's business and the trading price of the Company's securities. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a comprehensive evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, the Company is required to document and test its internal control over financial reporting, management is required to assess and issue a report concerning internal control over financial reporting, and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to and report on the Company's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls could cause the Company to fail to meet its periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in the consolidated financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify these or other internal control deficiencies. If the Company cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in the Company's reported financial information, the market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock could decline significantly, and its business, financial condition, and reputation could be harmed. 
 
 The Company's efforts to comply with Dodd-Frank and other evolving laws and regulations could result in increased costs and expenses related to compliance and potential violations. The Company is required to comply with various securities laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank"). Dodd-Frank contains provisions, among others, designed to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply chains of certain minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries that are believed to be benefiting armed groups ("Conflict Minerals"). While Dodd-Frank does not prohibit companies from using Conflict Minerals, the SEC mandates due diligence, disclosure and reporting requirements for companies for which Conflict Minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product. The Company's efforts to comply with Dodd-Frank and other evolving laws, regulations and standards could result in increased costs and expenses related to compliance and potential violations. 

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. 
 
 Not applicable. 

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY. 
 
 Cybersecurity Program 
 
 Matthews depends on integrated information systems to conduct its business. Accordingly, the Company has implemented a cybersecurity program designed to protect its information systems and to assess, identify and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. This comprehensive program addresses acceptable use, risk management, data privacy, incident management and reporting, identity and access management, third-party management, physical security, and vulnerability identification. The Company also deploys cybersecurity training courses to all employees, maintains an Incident Response Plan, establishes cybersecurity contingency plans and conducts phishing testing on a regular basis. 
 
 Matthews continues to invest in internal and external tools to better detect, patch, monitor, and restore systems. Further, the Company maintains cybersecurity insurance coverage intended to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents. 
 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 
 Matthews uses a risk-based approach to manage risks from cybersecurity threats according to the nature and sensitivity of the data and the criticality of the systems to operations. The Company also maintains a vulnerability management program where cybersecurity risks are identified, classified, and addressed and periodically conducts penetration testing through an independent third-party assessor. The Company conducts cybersecurity tabletop exercises to enhance mitigating controls and incident response preparedness. When management deems it advisable, the Company engages third parties, including consultants, advisors, and auditors, to assist with security and maturity assessments, security operations, employee training and awareness, compliance, penetration testing, network and endpoint monitoring, threat intelligence, and vulnerability management. 
 
 17 

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY, (continued) 

 Matthews uses a number of means to assess cyber risks related to its third-party service providers, including processes governing interconnections with third-party systems and regular review of critical vendors cybersecurity positions for potential risks. Third-party service provider assessments begin during onboarding and continue throughout the relationship, based upon an assessment of third-party risk. Those assessments include review of System and Organization Controls ("SOC") 1 and SOC 2 reports (as each such report is defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants), and direct interaction with key vendors to assess and address risks. Contracts with third-party service providers contain appropriate protective provisions for the Company including audit rights, third-party notification obligations, and security requirements for the retention of data. 
 
 Matthews maintains a cybersecurity Incident Response Plan. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, designated personnel including members of Information Technology ("IT"), finance, legal, communications, human resources and any affected unit or department are responsible for assessing the severity of an incident and associated threat, containing the threat, remediating the threat, including recovery of data and access to systems, analyzing any reporting obligations associated with the incident, and performing post-incident analysis and program enhancements. 
 
 Matthews has experienced cyber-attacks in the past and, while none of these cyber-attacks resulted in a material disruption to the Company s business, Matthews may experience additional cyber-attacks in the future. As of the filing of this Form 10-K, the Company is not aware of any such attacks that have occurred since the beginning of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. While the Company has implemented a cybersecurity program, the techniques used to infiltrate information technology systems continue to evolve. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to timely detect threats or anticipate and implement adequate security measures. For additional information, refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors - The Company relies on information technology to operate the Company's business. Security breach incidents and breakdowns of information technologies, or failure to comply with laws governing data privacy and data protection, could disrupt the Company's operations, subject the Company to legal claims, and impact the Company's financial results. 
 
 Governance 
 
 Board of Directors Oversight 
 
 Cybersecurity risks are overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors oversee and periodically review the design and effectiveness of the Company s cybersecurity program, as well as its contingency plans. The Chief Information Officer CIO and Director of IT Security provide regular reports to the Audit Committee, which include information about cyber-risk management, the effectiveness of the Company's cybersecurity framework, direct or emerging threats to the Company, program maturity and strategy, third-party risk management, and benchmarking against its industry peers. 
 
 Management s Role Managing Risk 
 
 Matthews CIO and Director of IT Security are primarily responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. The CIO reports directly to the Company s Chief Financial Officer, and the Director of IT Security reports to the CIO. The CIO, Director of IT Security, and the Company's cybersecurity team have decades of experience in various roles managing information security, developing cybersecurity strategy, and implementing, planning and operationalizing a comprehensive global IT infrastructure. 
 
 The Director of IT Security is responsible for the day-to-day management of the cybersecurity program, including the prevention, detection, investigation, response to, and recovery from cybersecurity threats and incidents. With the support of legal, the Director of IT Security is responsible for global regulatory compliance related to cybersecurity regulations and industry standards. The Director of IT Security also advises on the implementation of cybersecurity risk management in the Company s products and services as they are being developed. 
 
 As part of its risk management process, the Matthews management team also identifies, assesses and evaluates risks impacting the Company s operations, including those risks related to cybersecurity, and raises them for internal discussion, and where it is determined to be appropriate, issues are also raised to the Board of Directors for consideration.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 
 The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Management does not expect that the results of any of these ordinary course legal proceedings, as presently positioned, will have a material adverse effect on Matthews' financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 In addition to these ordinary course legal proceedings, the Company is involved in the following legal proceeding. 
 
 On October 7, 2024, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted the Company s motion to compel arbitration in response to a complaint filed by Tesla on June 14, 2024 against the Company in the Northern District of California, Civil Action No. 5:24-cv-03615 (N.D. Cal.), which alleged trade secret misappropriation under the DTSA and the CUTSA, breach of contract and unfair business practices. As a result of the Court s favorable ruling, the matter filed by Tesla has been effectively stayed pending arbitration. The Company maintains the claims vaguely stated in the complaint are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. The Company currently does not expect this matter will have a material adverse effect on Matthews' financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Sales relating to dry battery electrode solutions were approximately 6 of the Company's sales for fiscal 2024. For a discussion of the risks to the Company associated with this matter, see Item 1A - "Risk Factors - Intellectual property infringement assertions by third parties, including those of Tesla, could result in significant costs and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, operating results and reputation."

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Matthews and related notes thereto. In addition, see "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information" included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 
 
 The Company manages its businesses under three segments: Memorialization, Industrial Technologies and SGK Brand Solutions. The Memorialization segment consists primarily of bronze and granite memorials and other memorialization products, caskets, cremation-related products, and cremation and incineration equipment primarily for the cemetery and funeral home industries. The Industrial Technologies segment includes the design, manufacturing, service and sales of high-tech custom energy storage solutions; product identification and warehouse automation technologies and solutions, including order fulfillment systems for identifying, tracking, picking and conveying consumer and industrial products; and coating and converting lines for the packaging, pharma, foil, d cor and tissue industries. The SGK Brand Solutions segment consists of brand management, pre-media services, printing plates and cylinders, imaging services, digital asset management, merchandising display systems, and marketing and design services primarily for the consumer goods and retail industries. 
 
 The Company's primary measure of segment profitability is adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted EBITDA"). Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items that do not contribute directly to management s evaluation of its operating results. These items include stock-based compensation, the non-service portion of pension and postretirement expense, acquisition and divestiture costs, enterprise resource planning ("ERP") integration costs, and strategic initiatives and other charges. This presentation is consistent with how the Company's chief operating decision maker (the CODM evaluates the results of operations and makes strategic decisions about the business. For these reasons, the Company believes that adjusted EBITDA represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. 
 
 In addition, the CODM manages and evaluates the operating performance of the segments, as described above, on a pre-corporate cost allocation basis. Accordingly, for segment reporting purposes, the Company does not allocate corporate costs to its reportable segments. Corporate costs include management and administrative support to the Company, which consists of certain aspects of the Company s executive management, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology (including operational support) and finance departments. These costs are included within "Corporate and Non-Operating" in the following table to reconcile to consolidated adjusted EBITDA and are not considered a separate reportable segment. Management does not allocate non-operating items such as investment income, other income (deductions), net and noncontrolling interest to the segments. 

24 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, (continued) 

The following table sets forth sales and adjusted EBITDA for the Company's Memorialization, Industrial Technologies and SGK Brand Solutions segments for each of the last three fiscal years. Refer to Note 21, "Segment Information" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" for the Company's financial information by segment. 
 
 Years Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2022 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Sales to external customers: Memorialization 829,731 842,997 840,124 Industrial Technologies 433,156 505,751 335,523 SGK Brand Solutions 532,850 532,148 586,756 Consolidated Sales 1,795,737 1,880,896 1,762,403 Adjusted EBITDA: Memorialization 162,586 163,986 151,849 Industrial Technologies 39,716 66,278 56,762 SGK Brand Solutions 61,620 57,128 60,120 Corporate and Non-Operating (58,765) (61,583) (58,323) Total Adjusted EBITDA (1) 
 205,157 225,809 210,408 
 (1) Total Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section below. 
 
 Comparison of Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023: 
 
 Sales for the year ended September 30, 2024 were 1.80 billion, compared to 1.88 billion for the year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in fiscal 2024 sales primarily reflected lower sales in the Industrial Technologies and Memorialization segments. Memorialization segment sales for fiscal 2024 were 829.7 million, compared to 843.0 million for fiscal 2023. The sales decrease reflected lower unit sales of caskets, cemetery memorial products, and cremation equipment, predominantly resulting from a return to more normalized death rates following the COVID-19 pandemic. These declines were partially offset by improved price realization, benefits from recent acquisitions (see Acquisitions and Divestitures below), and higher mausoleum sales. Industrial Technologies segment sales for fiscal 2024 were 433.2 million, compared to 505.8 million for fiscal 2023. The decrease in sales reflected lower sales of purpose-built engineered products (primarily energy storage solutions for the electric vehicle market) and reduced sales of warehouse automation solutions. The decrease also reflected lower sales of the recently acquired automotive solutions business (R+S Automotive GmbH), as the Company discontinues these product offerings, and the sales impact of a fiscal 2023 divestiture (see Acquisitions and Divestitures below). Fiscal 2024 sales for the Industrial Technologies segment were impacted by slower market conditions for the warehouse automation business, and customer delays impacting the timing of projects within the energy storage business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of 4.1 million on the segment's sales compared to the prior year. In the SGK Brand Solutions segment, sales for fiscal 2024 were 532.9 million, compared to 532.1 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in sales reflected higher sales of cylinder (packaging) products in Europe, higher brand sales in the Asia-Pacific region, increased private-label brand sales, and improved price realization to mitigate inflationary cost increases. These increases were partially offset by lower retail-based sales, lower brand sales in Europe, and the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 3.1 million on the segment's sales compared to the prior year. 
 
 Gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2024 was 529.7 million, compared to 577.7 million for fiscal 2023. Consolidated gross profit as a percent of sales was 29.5 and 30.7 in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The decrease in gross profit reflected the impact of lower sales, lower margins on engineered products and cremation equipment, and higher material and labor costs. These decreases were partially offset by improved margins on warehouse automation solutions, product identification sales, and cylinder (packaging) products, and benefits from the realization of productivity improvements and other cost-reduction initiatives. Gross profit also included acquisition integration costs and other charges primarily in connection with cost-reduction initiatives totaling 39.2 million and 12.2 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 25 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, (continued) 

Selling and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2024 were 488.3 million, compared to 447.5 million for fiscal 2023. Consolidated selling and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales, were 27.2 for fiscal 2024, compared to 23.8 in fiscal 2023. Selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2024 reflected higher compensation costs and additional expenses from recently completed acquisitions, partially offset by benefits from ongoing cost-reduction initiatives and lower travel and entertainment ("T E") costs. Fiscal 2024 selling and administrative expenses included a non-cash impairment charge of 13.7 million for the write-down of certain net assets held-for-sale within the Memorialization segment. Refer to Note 24, "Asset Write-downs" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further details. Fiscal 2024 selling and administrative expenses included 12.4 million of legal costs related to an ongoing dispute in the Company's energy storage business (see Legal Matter below). Selling and administrative expenses also included acquisition integration and related systems-integration costs, and other charges primarily in connection with certain commercial, operational and cost-reduction initiatives totaling 24.5 million in fiscal 2024, compared to 12.5 million in fiscal 2023. Intangible amortization for the year ended September 30, 2024 was 37.0 million, compared to 42.1 million for fiscal 2023. In the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, the Company recorded a goodwill write-down of 16.7 million related to the Surfaces and Engineering reporting unit within the Industrial Technologies segment. Refer to Note 23, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further details. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2024 was 205.2 million, compared to 225.8 million for fiscal 2023. Memorialization segment adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2024 was 162.6 million, compared to 164.0 million for fiscal 2023. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA reflected the impact of lower unit sales, higher material and labor costs, and lower margins on cremation equipment. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of improved price realization, benefits from productivity initiatives, lower distribution costs, and lower performance-based compensation compared to fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the Industrial Technologies segment for fiscal 2024 was 39.7 million, compared to 66.3 million in fiscal 2023. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA primarily reflected the impact of lower sales, higher labor costs, lower margins on engineered products, and the impact of a fiscal 2023 divestiture. These decreases were partially offset by improved margins on warehouse automation solutions and product identification sales, benefits from cost-reduction initiatives, lower T E costs, and lower performance-based compensation compared to fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the SGK Brand Solutions segment for fiscal 2024 was 61.6 million, compared to 57.1 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA primarily reflected the impact of improved price realization, benefits from cost-reduction initiatives and improved margins on cylinder (packaging) products, partially offset by the impact of higher labor costs and higher performance-based compensation compared to fiscal 2023. 
 
 Interest expense for fiscal 2024 was 50.5 million, compared to 44.6 million in fiscal 2023. The increase in interest expense reflected higher average interest rates and an increase in average borrowing levels in the current fiscal year. Other income (deductions), net for the year ended September 30, 2024 represented a decrease in pre-tax income of 6.8 million, compared to a decrease in pre-tax income of 2.6 million in fiscal 2023. Other income (deductions), net includes the non-service components of pension and postretirement expense, which totaled 439,000 and 1.6 million in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Fiscal 2023 non-service pension expense included a 1.3 million non-cash charge resulting from the settlement of the Company's supplemental retirement plan ("SERP") and defined benefit portion of the officers retirement restoration plan ("ORRP") obligations. Refer to Note 16, "Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further details. Other income (deductions), net also includes investment income, banking-related fees and the impact of currency gains and losses on certain intercompany debt and foreign denominated cash balances. Other income (deductions), net included currency losses associated with highly inflationary accounting for the Company's subsidiaries in Turkey totaling 1.0 million and 1.4 million in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively (see Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further details). Fiscal 2024 other income (deductions), net included a non-cash impairment charge of 3.1 million for the write-down of a cost-method investment (see Note 8, "Investments" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further details). 
 
 The Company's consolidated income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2024 were a benefit of 10.0 million, compared to an expense of 1.8 million for fiscal 2023. The difference between the Company's consolidated income taxes for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 partially resulted from the Company's fiscal 2024 pre-tax consolidated loss position compared to pre-tax consolidated income for fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2024 tax rate included charges related to changes in the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets. These changes included both current year foreign net operating losses requiring a full valuation allowance as well as other changes in realizability of certain foreign net operating losses from prior years. The fiscal 2024 consolidated loss before income taxes also reflected a goodwill write-down and write-down of certain net assets held-for-sale that were non-deductible for tax purposes. Additionally, the fiscal 2024 tax rate benefited from research and development and foreign tax credits. The fiscal 2023 effective tax rate benefited from research and development and foreign tax credits, and changes in realizability of foreign deferred tax assets due to the utilization of foreign tax net operating losses with a valuation allowance. The fiscal 2023 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by share-based compensation.

 Comparison of Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022: 
 
 For a comparison of the Company's results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, see "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation" of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on November 17, 2023. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: 
 
 Included in this report are measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing its performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company s core operations including acquisition and divestiture costs, ERP integration costs, strategic initiative and other charges (which includes non-recurring charges related to certain commercial and operational initiatives and exit activities), stock-based compensation and the non-service portion of pension and postretirement expense. Management believes that presenting non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's core operations, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, forecast, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company s results. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provided herein, provides investors with an additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company s business that could not be obtained absent these disclosures. 
 
 The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA provides relevant and useful information, which is used by the Company s management in assessing the performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items that do not contribute directly to management s evaluation of its operating results. These items include stock-based compensation, the non-service portion of pension and postretirement expense, acquisition and divestiture costs, ERP integration costs, and strategic initiatives and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA provides the Company with an understanding of earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes, and the effects of certain acquisition and divestiture costs, and ERP integration costs, and items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company s operations. This measure may be useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance. It is also useful as a financial measure for lenders and is used by the Company s management to measure business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity. The Company's definition of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

 439 1,640 31,823 Total Adjusted EBITDA 205,157 225,809 210,408 
 (1) Includes fees for receivables sold under the RPA and factoring arrangements totaling 4.8 million, 4.0 million and 1.0 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 (2) Includes certain non-recurring costs associated with recent acquisition and divestiture activities, and also includes a gain of 1.8 million in fiscal year 2023 related to the divestiture of a business in the Industrial Technologies segment. 
 (3) Includes certain non-recurring costs associated with commercial, operational and cost-reduction initiatives and costs associated with global ERP system integration efforts. Fiscal 2024 also includes legal costs related to an ongoing dispute with Tesla, which totaled 12.4 million (See Note 19, "Commitments and Contingent Liabilities" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"). Fiscal 2023 includes loss recoveries totaling 2.2 million which were related to a previously disclosed theft of funds by a former employee initially identified in fiscal 2015. 
 (4) Includes certain non-recurring direct incremental costs (such as costs for purchases of computer peripherals and devices to facilitate working-from-home, additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies and services, etc.) incurred in response to COVID-19. This amount does not include the impact of any lost sales or underutilization due to COVID-19. 
 (5) Represents exchange losses associated with highly inflationary accounting related to the Company's Turkish subsidiaries (see Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ). 
 (6) Represents items associated with the termination of the Company's DB Plan, supplemental retirement plan and the defined benefit portion of the officers retirement restoration plan. 
 (7) Fiscal 2024 includes goodwill write-downs within the Industrial Technologies segment of 16.7 million (see Note 23, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"), asset write-downs within the Memorialization segment of 13.7 million (see Note 24, "Asset Write-Downs" in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"), and investment write-downs within Corporate and Non-operating of 3.1 million (see Note 8, "Investments" in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"). Fiscal 2022 includes goodwill write-downs within the SGK Brand Solutions segment of 82.5 million (see Note 23, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"), and asset write-downs net of recoveries within the SGK Brand Solutions segment of 10.1 million (see Note 24, "Asset Write-Downs" in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"). 
 (8) Non-service pension and postretirement expense includes interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses, curtailment gains and losses, and settlement gains and losses. These benefit cost components are excluded from adjusted EBITDA since they are primarily influenced by external market conditions that impact investment returns and interest (discount) rates. Curtailment gains and losses and settlement gains and losses are excluded from adjusted EBITDA since they generally result from certain non-recurring events, such as plan amendments to modify future benefits or settlements of plan obligations. The service cost and prior service cost components of pension and postretirement expense are included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, since they are considered to be a better reflection of the ongoing service-related costs of providing these benefits. Please note that GAAP pension and postretirement expense or the adjustment above are not necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to these employee benefit plans. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization was 27.8 million, 23.7 million, and 23.2 million, for the Memorialization segment, 23.8 million, 23.2 million, and 11.4 million for the Industrial Technologies segment, 38.7 million, 44.8 million, and 64.2 million for the SGK Brand Solutions segment, and 4.6 million, 4.8 million, and 5.3 million for Corporate and Non-Operating, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, (continued) 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES : 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 79.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to 79.5 million and 126.9 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2024 principally included net income (loss) adjusted for deferred taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, goodwill and other asset write-downs, non-cash pension expense, gain on divestitures and sale of assets, and other non-cash adjustments, and changes in working capital items. The change in working capital in fiscal 2024 primarily reflected lower inventory levels, higher accrued compensation related to severance and other employee termination benefits, changes in contract assets and liabilities related to products and services provided to customers over time, lower trade accounts payable, lower performance-based compensation accruals, and changes in other accounts. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2023 principally included net income (loss) adjusted for deferred taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash pension expense, gain on divestitures and sale of assets, and other non-cash adjustments, and changes in working capital items. Fiscal 2023 operating cash flow also reflected 24.2 million of contributions to fund the settlement of the Company's SERP and ORRP obligations, and 10.5 million of proceeds from the settlement of cash flow hedges. The change in working capital in fiscal 2023 primarily reflected higher inventory levels, lower trade accounts payable, and changes in contract assets and liabilities related to products and services provided to customers over time, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of receivables under a receivables purchase agreement and a non-recourse factoring arrangement (see below for further discussion). Operating cash flow for fiscal 2022 principally included net income (loss) adjusted for deferred taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, goodwill and other asset write-downs, non-cash pension expense, gain on divestitures and sale of assets, and other non-cash adjustments, and changes in working capital items. Fiscal 2022 operating cash flow also reflected 35.7 million of contributions to fully fund the settlement of the Company's DB Plan obligations. The favorable movements in working capital in fiscal 2022 primarily reflected proceeds from the sale of receivables under a receivables purchase agreement, partially offset by higher inventory levels reflecting increased commodity costs, lower performance-based compensation accruals, and changes in other accounts. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 47.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to 58.7 million and 80.9 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Investing activities for fiscal 2024 primarily reflected capital expenditures of 45.2 million, acquisition payments (net of cash acquired or received from sellers) of 5.8 million, purchases of investments of 825,000, and proceeds from the sale of assets of 4.2 million . Investing activities for fiscal 2023 primarily reflected capital expenditures of 50.6 million, acquisition payments (net of cash acquired or received from sellers) of 15.3 million, purchases of investments of 1.6 million, proceeds from the sale of assets of 2.1 million, and proceeds from divestitures of 6.7 million . Investing activities for fiscal 2022 primarily reflected capital expenditures of 61.3 million, acquisition payments (net of cash acquired or received from sellers) of 44.5 million , purchases of investments of 2.2 million, proceeds from the sale of assets of 5.0 million, proceeds from the sale of investments of 8.8 million, and proceeds from the settlement of net investment hedges of 13.1 million . 
 
 Capital expenditures were 45.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to 50.6 million and 61.3 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capital expenditures in each of the last three fiscal years reflected reinvestments in the Company's business segments and were made primarily for the purchase of new production machinery, equipment, software and systems, and facilities designed to improve product quality, increase manufacturing efficiency, lower production costs and meet regulatory requirements. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment has averaged 52.4 million for the last three fiscal years. Capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years were primarily financed through operating cash. Capital spending for fiscal 2025 is currently estimated to be in the range of approximately 50 million to 60 million. The Company expects to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund all anticipated capital spending projects. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2024 was 35.0 million, and principally reflected repayments, net of proceeds, on long-term debt of 31.3 million, purchases of treasury stock of 20.6 million, payment of dividends of 31.4 million, payments of debt issuance costs of 10.2 million (see below), and proceeds from net investment hedges of 58.4 million (see below).

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, (continued) 

The Company has a domestic credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that was amended and restated in September 2024. The amended and restated loan agreement includes a 750.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, which matures in January 2029, subject to the terms and conditions of the amended facility. The obligations under the domestic credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Company's and certain of its domestic subsidiaries' assets. A portion of the revolving credit facility (not to exceed 350.0 million can be drawn in foreign currencies. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus a 0.10 per annum rate spread adjustment, plus a factor ranging from 1.00 to 2.00 (1.50 at September 30, 2024) based on the Company's leverage ratio. The leverage ratio is defined as total indebtedness divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) as defined within the domestic credit facility agreement. The Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 (based on the Company's leverage ratio) of the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of 4.9 million in connection with the amended and restated agreement, which were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the facility. Unamortized costs were 5.0 million and 949,000 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The domestic credit facility requires the Company to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios. A portion of the facility (not to exceed 75.0 million) is available for the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit. Outstanding U.S. dollar denominated borrowings on the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 410.5 million and 405.0 million, respectively. Outstanding Euro denominated borrowings on the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 30.0 million 33.5 million) and 55.0 million 58.2 million), respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings for the domestic credit facility (including the effects of interest rate swaps and Euro denominated borrowings) at September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4.59 and 5.95 , respectively. 
 
 In September 2024, the Company issued 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625 senior secured second lien notes due October 1, 2027 (the "2027 Senior Secured Notes"). The 2027 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.625 per annum with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning on April 1, 2025. The Company's obligations under the 2027 Senior Secured Notes are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of the Company s and certain of its domestic subsidiaries assets. The Company is subject to certain covenants and other restrictions in connection with the 2027 Senior Secured Notes. The net proceeds from the 2027 Senior Secured Notes, together with additional funds borrowed under the Company s domestic credit facility, were irrevocably deposited into a trust and were subsequently used to redeem all of the Company s outstanding 5.25 senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes on October 24, 2024, and to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the 2025 Senior Notes at such time. Effective with the irrevocable deposit of these amounts into the trust in September 2024, the Company satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Notes in accordance with its terms. Accordingly, the remaining unamortized direct financing costs from the 2025 Senior Notes, which totaled 585,000 , were charged to interest expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company incurred direct financing fees and costs of 5.2 million in connection with 2027 Senior Secured Notes, which were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the 2027 Senior Secured Notes. Unamortized costs related to the Company s notes were 5.2 million and 1.1 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries sell, on a continuous basis without recourse, their trade receivables to Matthews Receivables Funding Corporation, LLC Matthews RFC ), a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote subsidiary of the Company. Matthews RFC has a receivables purchase agreement RPA to sell up to 125.0 million of receivables to certain purchasers (the Purchasers on a recurring basis in exchange for cash (referred to as capital within the RPA) equal to the gross receivables transferred. The parties intend that the transfers of receivables to the Purchasers constitute purchases and sales of receivables. Matthews RFC has guaranteed to each Purchaser the prompt payment of sold receivables, and has granted a security interest in its assets for the benefit of the Purchasers. Under the RPA, each Purchaser s share of capital accrues yield at a floating rate plus an applicable margin. The Company is the master servicer under the RPA, and is responsible for administering and collecting receivables. The RPA, which had a maturity date of March 2024, was amended in March 2024 to extend the maturity date to March 2026. 
 
 The proceeds of the RPA are classified as operating activities in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash received from collections of sold receivables may be used to fund additional purchases of receivables on a revolving basis, or to reduce all or any portion of the outstanding capital of the Purchasers. The fair value of the sold receivables approximated book value due to their credit quality and short-term nature, and as a result, no gain or loss on sale of receivables was recorded. As of September 30, 2024, and 2023, the amount sold to the Purchasers was 96.3 million and 101.8 million, respectively which was derecognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As collateral against sold receivables, Matthews RFC maintains a certain level of unsold receivables, which was 58.2 million and 57.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

30 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, (continued) 

The following table sets forth a summary of receivables sold as part of the RPA: 
 For the Year Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Gross receivables sold 
 379,094 393,493 Cash collections reinvested 
 (384,594) (388,283) Net cash (payments) proceeds (5,500) 5,210 
 
 In March 2023, the Company, through its U.K. subsidiary, entered into a non-recourse factoring arrangement. In connection with this arrangement, the Company periodically sells trade receivables to a third-party purchaser in exchange for cash. These transfers of financial assets are recorded at the time the Company surrenders control of the assets. As these transfers qualify as true sales under the applicable accounting guidance, the receivables are de-recognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets upon transfer. The principal amount of receivables sold under this arrangement was 70.2 million and 55.2 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discounts on the trade receivables sold are included within administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The proceeds from the sale of receivables are classified as operating activities in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of factored receivables that remained outstanding was 15.7 million and 18.0 million, respectively. 
 
 The Company, through certain of its European subsidiaries, has a credit facility with a European bank, which is guaranteed by Matthews. The maximum amount of borrowings available under this facility is 10.0 million 11.2 million). This facility also provides 18.5 million 20.6 million) for bank guarantees. This facility has no stated maturity date and is available until terminated. There were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 
 Other borrowings totaled 15.6 million and 19.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was 2.66 and 2.95 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company operates internationally and utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage its foreign currency, debt and interest rate exposures. The following table presents information related to interest rate swaps entered into by the Company and designated as cash flow hedges: 
 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Notional amount 175,000 175,000 Weighted-average maturity period (years) 3.2 4.1 Weighted-average received rate 4.85 5.32 Weighted-average pay rate 3.83 3.83 
 
 The Company enters into interest rate swaps in order to achieve a mix of fixed and variable rate debt that it deems appropriate. In order to transition the Company's swaps from LIBOR-based to SOFR-based rates, the LIBOR-based swaps were settled during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, resulting in cash proceeds of 10.5 million. Concurrently, the Company entered into new interest rate swaps with SOFR-based rates with a notional amount of 175.0 million. The interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of future variable interest payments, which are considered probable of occurring. Based on the Company's assessment, all of the critical terms of each of the hedges matched the underlying terms of the hedged debt and related forecasted interest payments, and as such, these hedges were considered highly effective. 
 
 The fair value of the interest rate swaps reflected a net unrealized loss of 2.6 million 1.9 million after tax) and a net unrealized gain of 4.0 million 3.0 million after tax) at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that is included in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"). Unrecognized gains of 3.8 million 2.9 million after tax) and 8.1 million 6.0 million after tax) related to previously terminated LIBOR-based swaps were also included in AOCI as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Assuming market rates remain constant with the rates at September 30, 2024, a gain (net of tax) of approximately 1.0 million included in AOCI is expected to be recognized in earnings over the next twelve months.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, (continued) 

The Company utilizes certain cross currency swaps as net investment hedges of foreign operations and assesses effectiveness for these contracts based on changes in fair value attributable to changes in spot prices. The following table presents information related to cross currency swaps entered into by the Company and designated as net investment hedges: 
 
 Notional Amount Unrealized Losses Recognized in AOCI Swap Currencies Maturity Date September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (Dollar amounts in thousands) USD/EUR September 2027 81,392 81,392 (5,440) (2,065) USD/SEK June 2025 20,000 (468) USD/SGD August 2026 20,000 (441) USD/EUR August 2026 25,000 (30) 146,392 81,392 (6,379) (1) 
 (2,065) (1) 
 (1) Total unrealized losses are presented net of tax of 2,156 and 701, for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 In connection with certain of these cross currency swaps, the Company received cash from the counterparties, representing partial advance payments of amounts due under the U.S. dollar leg of the swaps. Such amounts totaled 58.4 million, of which 17.4 million and 41.0 million were included in other current liabilities and other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company uses certain foreign currency debt instruments as net investment hedges of foreign operations with a notional amount of 30.0 million 33.5 million) as of September 30, 2024. Currency losses of 3.8 million (net of income taxes of 1.1 million), which represent effective hedges of net investments, were reported as a component of AOCI within currency translation adjustment at September 30, 2024. No such net investment hedges were outstanding as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company has a stock repurchase program. The buy-back program is designed to increase shareholder value, enlarge the Company's holdings of its Class A Common Stock, and add to earnings per share. Repurchased shares may be retained in treasury, utilized for acquisitions, or reissued to employees or other purchasers, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation. Under the current authorization, 611,321 shares remain available for repurchase as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Consolidated working capital was 197.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 253.7 million at September 30, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents were 40.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 42.1 million at September 30, 2023. The Company's current ratio was 1.5 and 1.6 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, (continued) 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company made lump sum payments totaling 24.2 million to fully settle the Company's non-qualified Supplemental Retirement Plan ("SERP") and defined benefit portion of the Company's Officers Retirement Restoration Plan ("ORRP") obligations. The settlement of these plan obligations resulted in the recognition of a non-cash charge of 1.3 million, which has been presented as a component of other income (deductions), net for the year ended September 30, 2023. This amount represents the immediate recognition of the deferred AOCI balances related to the SERP and ORRP. 
 
 Unrecognized tax benefits are positions taken, or expected to be taken, on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken, or expected to be taken, or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, excluding penalties and interest, of approximately 4.5 million. The timing of potential future payments related to the unrecognized tax benefits is not presently determinable. The Company believes that its current liquidity sources, combined with its operating cash flow and borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet its capital needs for the foreseeable future. 

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES: 
 
 Refer to Note 22, "Acquisitions and Divestitures" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for further details on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures. 

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION: 
 
 Management routinely develops and reviews with the Company s Board of Directors strategic plans with the primary objective of continuous improvement in the Company s consolidated sales and operating results. Strategic plans are developed at the business segment level and generally contain strategies for organic growth and acquisitions. Organic growth primarily reflects the Company s internal efforts to grow its businesses including commercial activities, cost structure and productivity improvements, new product development, and the expansion into new markets with existing products. Growth through acquisitions reflects the benefits from acquired businesses and also includes related integration activities to achieve commercial and cost synergy benefits. 
 
 The significant factors influencing organic sales growth in the Industrial Technologies segment include economic/industrial market conditions, new product development, and the electric vehicles ("EV") and e-commerce trends. Sales within this segment may also be influenced by the timing of work with the Company's largest energy storage customer, as well as the level of advancement by existing and potential new customers towards adopting new production solutions. For the Memorialization segment, the Company expects that sales growth will be influenced by North America death rates and the impact of the increasing trend toward cremation on the segment's product offerings, including caskets, cemetery memorial products and cremation-related products. For the SGK Brand Solutions segment, the Company expects that sales growth will be influenced by global economic conditions, brand innovation, the level of marketing spending by the Company's clients, and government regulation. Due to the global footprint of the Company s businesses, particularly the Industrial Technologies and SGK Brand Solutions segments, currency fluctuations can also be a significant factor on the Company s U.S. dollar reported results. 
 
 Recent labor cost increases, supply chain challenges, and other inflation-related impacts are expected to impact the Company's results for the near future. The Company expects to partially mitigate these cost increases through price realization and cost-reduction initiatives. The Company initiated cost reduction programs during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which are primarily focused on the Company's engineering and tooling operations in Europe, as well as the Company's general and administrative functions. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES: 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience, economic conditions, and in some cases, actuarial techniques. Actual results may differ from those estimates. A discussion of market risks affecting the Company can be found in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 33 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, (continued) 

The Company's significant accounting policies are included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide useful and reliable financial information about the Company's operating results and financial condition. The following accounting policies involve significant estimates, which were considered critical to the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Long-Lived Assets, including Property, Plant and Equipment: 
 
 Long-lived assets are recorded at their respective cost basis on the date of acquisition. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is computed primarily on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and intangibles with finite useful lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by evaluating the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis. An asset considered held-for-sale is reported at the lower of the asset's carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. No impairment charges for property, plant and equipment were recognized during the years presented, except as disclosed in Note 24, Asset Write-Downs" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
 
 Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles: 
 
 Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested annually for impairment, or when circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist. In general, when the carrying value of these assets exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss must be recognized. A significant decline in cash flows generated from these assets may result in a write-down of the carrying values of the related assets. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company uses a combination of valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and other market indicators. A number of assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the discounted cash flow model to forecast operating cash flows, including sales volumes and pricing, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, working capital changes, and discount rates. The Company estimates future cash flows using volume and pricing assumptions based largely on existing customer relationships and contracts, and operating cost assumptions management believes are reasonable based on historical performance and projected future performance as reflected in its most recent operating plans and projections. The discount rates used in the discounted cash flow analyses are developed with the assistance of valuation experts and management believes the discount rates appropriately reflect the risks associated with the Company's operating cash flows. In order to further validate the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of the reporting units as of the valuation date, a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of all reporting units to market capitalization is performed using a reasonable control premium. 
 The Company performed its annual impairment review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (January 1, 2024) and determined that the estimated fair values for all goodwill reporting units exceeded their carrying values, therefore no impairment charges were necessary. The results of this review indicated that the estimated fair value of the Company's SGK Brand Solutions reporting unit exceeded the carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) by approximately 7 . The fair value for the reporting unit was determined using level 3 inputs (including estimates of revenue growth, EBITDA contribution and the discount rates) and a combination of the income approach using the estimated discounted cash flows and a market-based valuation methodology. If current projections are not achieved or specific valuation factors outside the Company's control (such as discount rates and continued economic and industry challenges) significantly change, additional goodwill write-downs may be necessary in future periods. 
 The Company's Surfaces and Engineering reporting unit experienced declines during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily related to the Company's recently acquired (August 2022) Olbrich GmbH business. The Company determined that a triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, resulting in a re-evaluation of the goodwill for the Surfaces and Engineering reporting unit as of September 1, 2024. As a result of this interim assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill write-down totaling 16.7 million during the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, reducing the amount of goodwill for this reporting unit to zero. The fair value for the reporting unit was determined using level 3 inputs (including estimates of revenue growth, EBITDA contribution and the discount rates) and the income approach valuation methodology which utilizes estimated discounted cash flows of the reporting unit. 
 
 34 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, (continued) 

In fiscal 2022, in its assessment of the potential impacts of weakened economic conditions (particularly in Europe), increases in the cost of certain materials, labor, and other inflation-related pressures, and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates on the estimated future earnings and cash flows for the SGK Brand Solutions reporting unit, and in light of the limited excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit, management determined a triggering event occurred, resulting in a re-evaluation of goodwill for the reporting unit, as of September 1, 2022. As a result of this interim assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill write-down totaling 82.5 million during the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter. Subsequent to this write-down, the fair value of the SGK Brand Solutions reporting unit approximated its carrying value at September 1, 2022. The fair value for the reporting unit was determined using level 3 inputs (including estimates of revenue growth, EBITDA contribution and the discount rates) and a combination of the income approach using the estimated discounted cash flows and a market-based valuation methodology. 
 Income Taxes: 
 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since they have either been previously taxed, or are exempt from tax, or such earnings are considered to be reinvested indefinitely in foreign operations. 

INFLATION: 
 Recent labor cost increases and other inflation-related pressures have had an unfavorable impact on the Company's results of operations (see "Results of Operations"). Although recent economic conditions increase the level of uncertainty in the Company's near-term outlook, inflation is not currently anticipated to have a material impact on a long-term basis. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: 
 
 Refer to Note 3, "Accounting Pronouncements" in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for further details on recently issued accounting pronouncements. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK: 
 
 The following discussion about the Company's market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The Company has market risk related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not generally use derivative financial instruments in connection with these market risks, except as noted below. 
 
 Interest Rates - The Company's most significant long-term instrument is the domestic credit facility. U.S. dollar denominated debt under the domestic credit facility bears interest at variable rates based on SOFR (LIBOR for periods prior to March 2023). 
 
 The following table presents information related to interest rate contracts entered into by the Company and designated as cash flow hedges: 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Pay fixed swaps - notional amount 175,000 175,000 Weighted-average maturity period (years) 3.2 4.1 Weighted-average received rate 4.85 5.32 Weighted-average pay rate 3.83 3.83 
 
 The interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the future variable interest payments which are considered probable of occurring. Based on the Company's assessment, all the critical terms of each of the hedges matched the underlying terms of the hedged debt and related forecasted interest payments, and as such, these hedges were considered highly effective. 
 
 35 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK, (continued) 

The fair value of the interest rate swaps reflected a net unrealized loss of 2.6 million 1.9 million after-tax) at September 30, 2024 that is included in equity as part of AOCI. A hypothetical decrease of 10 in market interest rates (e.g., a decrease from 5.0 to 4.5 would result in a pre-tax decrease of approximately 1.5 million in the fair value of the interest rate swaps. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates - The Company is subject to changes in various foreign currency exchange rates, primarily including the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, and Australian Dollar in the conversion from local currencies to the U.S. dollar of the reported financial position and operating results of its non-U.S. based subsidiaries. An adverse change (strengthening U.S. dollar) of 10 in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in reported sales of 65.0 million and a decrease in reported operating loss of 4.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cross currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 146.4 million designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations. The net unrealized loss for these swap contracts at September 30, 2024 was 8.5 million 6.4 million after-tax). As of September 30, 2024, the potential pre-tax gain or loss in the fair value of these swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in the market rates would be approximately 15.9 million. 
 
 Commodity Price Risks - In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price fluctuations related to the purchases of certain materials and supplies (such as bronze ingot, steel, granite, fuel and wood) used in its manufacturing operations. The Company obtains competitive prices for materials and supplies when available. In addition, based on competitive market conditions and to the extent that the Company has established pricing terms with customers through contracts or similar arrangements, the Company's ability to immediately increase the price of its products to offset the increased costs may be limited. 
 
 Actuarial Assumptions - As of September 30, 2024, all of the Company's defined benefit plans are unfunded. The most significant actuarial assumption affecting pension expense and pension obligations is discount rates. A hypothetical decrease of 1 in discount rates would result in an increase of approximately 2.4 million in the projected benefit obligation. Refer to Note 16, "Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.

 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting management has conducted an assessment using the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Internal controls over financial reporting is a process under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO, and has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024.

Valuation of SGK Brand Solutions Reporting Unit Goodwill Description of the Matter As more fully described in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2024, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of January 1, 2024 and determined that the estimated fair value of the SGK Brand Solutions reporting unit, within the SGK Brand Solutions segment, exceeded the carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) by approximately 7 . The Company utilized a combination of the income approach using the estimated discounted cash flows and a market-based valuation methodology. Significant assumptions used in the Company s fair value estimate included the estimates of revenue growth, EBITDA contribution and the discount rates. Auditing the annual impairment analysis was complex, as it included estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate is sensitive to the significant assumptions named above, which are affected by expected future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company s goodwill impairment review process. These controls include management s assessment of indicators of impairment, management's review of the assumptions utilized to develop the estimate, and management s verification of the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data utilized to project future operating results for the reporting unit. To test the fair value of the reporting unit, our audit procedures included, among others, involving our valuation specialists to assist in assessing the valuation methodologies utilized by the Company and its valuation expert and testing the significant assumptions and underlying data used by the Company. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, changes in the Company s business model, and other relevant factors. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of the reporting unit resulting from changes in key assumptions. We reviewed the reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company and assessed the resulting control premium.

The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. Renewals and betterments of a nature considered to extend the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by evaluating the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis. An asset considered held-for-sale is reported at the lower of the asset's carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. No impairment charges for property, plant and equipment were recognized during the years presented, except as disclosed in Note 24, Asset Write-Downs."

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested annually for impairment, or when circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist. In general, when the carrying value of these assets exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss must be recognized. A significant decline in cash flows generated from these assets may result in a write-down of the carrying values of the related assets. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company uses a combination of valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and other market indicators. For purposes of testing indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company generally uses a relief from royalty method.

 Matthews has elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. 
 
 Benefit payments under the Company's DB Plan were made from plan assets, while benefit payments under the SERP were made from the Company's operating funds. Benefit payments under the Company's postretirement benefit plan are made from the Company's operating funds. 
 
 The weighted-average assumptions in the following table represent the rates used to develop the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the year listed and also the net periodic benefit cost for the following year. The measurement date of annual actuarial valuations for the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans was September 30, for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. 

In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries' Retirement Plans Experience Committee ("RPEC") released new mortality tables known as RP-2014. Each year, RPEC releases an update to the mortality improvement assumption that was released with the RP 2014 tables. The Company considered the RPEC mortality and mortality improvement tables and performed a review of its own mortality history to assess the appropriateness of the RPEC tables for use in generating financial results. In October 2019, the Society of Actuaries released updated base mortality tables denoted PRI-2012, replacing the RP-2014 base tables. In fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company elected to value its pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities using the base PRI-2012 mortality table and a slightly modified fully generational mortality improvement assumption. The revised assumption uses the most recent RPEC Scale MP mortality improvement table for all years where the RPEC tables are based on finalized data, and the most recently published Social Security Administration Intermediate mortality improvement for subsequent years.

 The Company's consolidated income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2024 were a benefit of , compared to an expense of for fiscal 2023, and a benefit of for fiscal 2022. The difference between the Company's consolidated income taxes for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 partially resulted from the Company's fiscal 2024 pre-tax consolidated loss position compared to pre-tax consolidated income for fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2024 tax rate included charges related to changes in the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets. These changes included both current year foreign net operating losses requiring a full valuation allowance as well as other changes in realizability of certain foreign net operating losses from prior years. The fiscal 2024 consolidated loss before income taxes also reflected a goodwill write-down and write-down of certain net assets held-for-sale that were non-deductible for tax purposes. Additionally, the fiscal 2024 tax rate benefited from research and development and foreign tax credits. The fiscal 2023 effective tax rate benefited from research and development and foreign tax credits, and changes in realizability of foreign deferred tax assets due to the utilization of foreign tax net operating losses with a valuation allowance. The fiscal 2023 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by share-based compensation. The difference between the Company's consolidated income taxes for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 partially resulted from fiscal 2023 having consolidated income before income taxes compared to fiscal 2022 having a consolidated loss before income taxes. The fiscal 2023 tax rate was negatively impacted by share-based compensation. Additionally, the fiscal 2023 tax rate benefited from research and development and foreign tax credits and the utilization of foreign tax net operating losses with a valuation allowance. The fiscal 2022 consolidated loss reflected a goodwill write-down recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 that was primarily non-deductible. The fiscal 2022 effective tax rate also benefited from research and development and foreign tax credits. The fiscal 2022 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by foreign net operating losses requiring a full valuation allowance. 
 
 The Company's foreign subsidiaries had losses before income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2024 of approximately , income before income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2023 of approximately and losses before income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2022 of approximately . At September 30, 2024, undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which deferred income taxes have not been provided approximated . Deferred income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since they have either been previously taxed, or are now exempt from tax, under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or such earnings are considered to be reinvested indefinitely in foreign operations. A determination of the deferred tax liability to be recorded if the earnings were not permanently reinvested is not practicable.

 segments: Memorialization, Industrial Technologies and SGK Brand Solutions. The Memorialization segment consists primarily of bronze and granite memorials and other memorialization products, caskets, cremation-related products, and cremation and incineration equipment primarily for the cemetery and funeral home industries. The Industrial Technologies segment includes the design, manufacturing, service and sales of high-tech custom energy storage solutions; product identification and warehouse automation technologies and solutions, including order fulfillment systems for identifying, tracking, picking and conveying consumer and industrial products; and coating and converting lines for the packaging, pharma, foil, d cor and tissue industries. The SGK Brand Solutions segment consists of brand management, pre-media services, printing plates and cylinders, imaging services, digital asset management, merchandising display systems, and marketing and design services primarily for the consumer goods and retail industries. 
 
 The Company's primary measure of segment profitability is adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted EBITDA"). Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items that do not contribute directly to management s evaluation of its operating results. These items include stock-based compensation, the non-service portion of pension and postretirement expense, acquisition and divestiture costs, enterprise resource planning ("ERP") integration costs, and strategic initiatives and other charges. This presentation is consistent with how the Company's chief operating decision maker (the CODM evaluates the results of operations and makes strategic decisions about the business. For these reasons, the Company believes that adjusted EBITDA represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss.

The results of this review indicated that the estimated fair value of the Company's SGK Brand Solutions reporting unit exceeded the carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) by approximately . The fair value for the reporting unit was determined using level 3 inputs (including estimates of revenue growth, EBITDA contribution and the discount rates) and a combination of the income approach using the estimated discounted cash flows and a market-based valuation methodology. If current projections are not achieved or specific valuation factors outside the Company's control (such as discount rates and continued economic and industry challenges) significantly change, additional goodwill write-downs may be necessary in future periods.

 Equity Compensation Plans: 
 
 The Company maintains an equity incentive plan (as amended and restated, the "2017 Equity Incentive Plan") that provides for grants of stock options, restricted shares, restricted share units ("RSUs"), stock-based performance units and certain other types of stock-based awards. The Company also maintains equity incentive plans (the "2012 Equity Incentive Plan" and "2007 Equity Incentive Plan") and a stock incentive plan (the "1992 Incentive Stock Plan") that previously provided for grants of stock options, restricted shares, stock-based performance units and certain other types of stock-based awards. Under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, which has a ten-year term from the date the Company's Board of Directors approved of the amendment and restatement of the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares available for grants or awards is an aggregate of 3,450,000 (subject to adjustment upon certain events such as stock dividends or stock splits), following the amendment and restatement of the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan at the Company's 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting. There will be no further grants under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 1992 Incentive Stock Plan. In November 2024, the Board of Directors approved the Second Amended and Restated 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Second Amended 2017 Plan"), which increases the maximum number of shares available for grants or awards to an aggregate of 4,950,000. The Second Amended 2017 Plan is subject to shareholder approval at the February 2025 Annual Shareholder Meeting. At September 30, 2024, 1,187,901 shares have been issued under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan. 1,233,583 time-based RSUs, 1,579,514 performance-based RSUs, and 75,000 stock options have been granted under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan. 1,707,349 of these share-based awards are outstanding as of September 30, 2024. All plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The number of shares issued under performance-based RSUs may be up to 200 of the number of performance-based RSUs, based on the satisfaction of specific criteria established by the plan administrator. 
 
 With respect to the restricted share unit grants, units generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. The number of units that vest depend on certain time and performance thresholds. Such performance thresholds include adjusted earnings per share, return on invested capital, appreciation in the market value of the Company's Class A Common Stock, or other targets 
 81 

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT, continued 

 established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Approximately 40 of the outstanding share units vest based on time, while the remaining vest based on pre-defined performance thresholds. The Company issues common stock from treasury shares once vested. 
 
 The Company maintains the Amended and Restated 2019 Director Fee Plan, the Amended and Restated 2014 Director Fee Plan and the 1994 Director Fee Plan (collectively, the "Director Fee Plans"). There will be no further fees or share-based awards granted under the Amended and Restated 2014 Director Fee Plan and the 1994 Director Fee Plan. Under the Amended and Restated 2019 Director Fee Plan, non-employee directors (except for the Chairman of the Board) each receive, as an annual retainer fee for fiscal 2024, either cash or shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock with a value equal to 90,000. The annual retainer fee for fiscal 2024 paid to the non-employee Chairman of the Board is 210,000. Where the annual retainer fee is provided in shares, each director may elect to be paid these shares on a current basis or have such shares credited to a deferred stock account as phantom stock, with such shares to be paid to the director subsequent to leaving the Board. The total number of shares of stock that have been authorized to be issued under the Amended and Restated 2019 Director Fee Plan or credited to a deferred stock compensation account for subsequent issuance is 300,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (subject to adjustment upon certain events such as stock dividends or stock splits), following the amendment and restatement of the 2019 Director Fee Plans at the Company's 2023 Annual Shareholder Meeting. The value of deferred shares is recorded in other liabilities. A total of 51,147 shares and share units had been deferred under the Director Fee Plans at September 30, 2024. Additionally, non-employee directors each receive an annual stock-based grant (non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights and/or restricted shares or units) with a value of 140,000 for fiscal 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 377,460 restricted shares and RSUs have been granted under the Director Fee Plans, 204,231 of which were issued under the 2019 Director Fee Plan. 71,549 RSUs are unvested at September 30, 2024 under the Director Fee Plans.

The Company provides a matching contribution of 10 of such purchases subject to certain limitations under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

PART I OF THIS POLICY ON INSIDER TRADING 
 THIS PART I OF THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ALL OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY 
 Transactions Subject to this Policy 
 This Policy applies to all trading and other transactions (i) in Company Securities, including transactions in the Company s common stock, options to purchase common stock, or any other type of securities that the Company may issue, including (but not limited to) preferred stock, convertible notes, bonds and warrants, as well as any derivative securities related to Company Securities, whether or not issued by the Company and (ii) the securities of certain other companies, including common stock, options and other securities issued by those companies, as well as derivative securities relating to any of those companies securities, where the person trading used non-public information obtained while working for the Company. 
 Individual Responsibility 
 You have ethical and legal obligations to maintain the confidentiality of information about the Company and to refrain from engaging in transactions in Company Securities while in possession of material nonpublic information. In this regard, you are responsible for ensuring that you comply with this Policy, or an entity that you control whose transactions are subject to this Policy, as discussed above, also complies with this Policy. In addition, you shall be expected, at all times, to exercise reasonable care and vigilance in safeguarding and securing any information that may be considered as material, confidential and or non-public. 
 In all cases, the responsibility for determining whether an individual is in possession of material nonpublic information rests with that individual. Any action by the Company, the Compliance Officer or any other employee or director of the Company pursuant to this Policy (or otherwise) does not in any way constitute legal advice or insulate an individual from liability under applicable securities laws. You could be subject to severe legal penalties and disciplinary action by the Company for conduct that is prohibited by this Policy or applicable securities laws, as described in greater detail below under the heading, Consequences of Violations. 
 Statement of Policy 
 It is the Company s policy that if you become aware of material nonpublic information related to the Company, you may not directly or indirectly through family members or other persons or entities 
 a. engage in transactions in Company Securities, except as otherwise specified in this Policy under the headings Exception Transactions Under Company Plans, Exception Transactions Not Involving a Purchase or Sale and Rule 10b5-1.

b. recommend the purchase or sale of any Company Securities 
 c. disclose material nonpublic information tip to persons within the Company whose jobs do not require them to have that information, or outside of the Company to other persons, including, but not limited to, family, friends, business associates, investors and expert consulting firms, unless any such disclosure is made in accordance with the Company s policies regarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of information regarding the Company or 
 d. assist anyone engaged in the above activities. 
 Please note that you may be in possession of such material nonpublic information following your termination of service. The prohibitions included in this Policy continue to apply even after your termination of service to the Company, and it is the responsibility of each person subject to this Policy to comply. 
 In addition, if in the course of working for the Company you become aware of material nonpublic information about a company with which the Company does business (e.g., a customer or supplier of the Company), you cannot trade in that company s securities until such information becomes public or is no longer material. Further, it is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or other employee of the Company, or any other person designated as subject to this Policy, who knows of any such material nonpublic information may communicate that information to, or tip, any other person, including family members and friends, or otherwise disclose such information without the Company s authorization. 
 Except as specified herein, there are no exceptions to this Policy. Transactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons (i.e., the need to raise money for an emergency expenditure), or small transactions, are not excepted from this Policy. The securities laws do not recognize any mitigating circumstances, and even the appearance of an improper transaction must be avoided to preserve the Company s reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct. For compliance purposes, you should never trade, tip or recommend securities (or otherwise cause the purchase or sale of securities) while in possession of information that you have reason to believe is material and nonpublic. If you have questions, please check with the Compliance Officer. 
 Definition of Material Nonpublic Information 
 Material Information Information is considered material if a reasonable investor would consider that information important in making a decision to buy, hold or sell securities. Any information that has market significance, that is if it could be expected to affect the Company s stock price, whether it is positive or negative, should be considered material. There is no bright-line standard for assessing materiality rather, materiality is based on an assessment of all of the facts and circumstances, and is often evaluated by enforcement authorities with the benefit of hindsight. While it is not possible to define all categories of material information, some examples of information that ordinarily would be regarded as material are

a. projections of future earnings or losses, or other earnings guidance, including changes to previously- announced earnings guidance 
 b. changes to previously announced earnings guidance, or the decision to suspend earnings guidance 
 c. proposals, plans, or agreements, even if preliminary in nature, involving mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, restructurings, recapitalizations, strategic alliances, or purchases or sales of significant assets

 q. changes in debt ratings 
 r. a significant information or cyber security breach 
 s. pending or threatened significant litigation, or the resolution of such litigation or 
 t. gain or loss of a significant customer or supplier. 
 Material information is not limited to historical facts, but also may include projections and forecasts. With respect to a future event, the point at which events, such as a merger, acquisition or introduction of a new product, the point at which negotiations or product development are determined to be material is evaluated by balancing (i) the probability that the event will occur again (ii) the magnitude of the effect that the event would have on a company s operations or stock price, should it occur. Thus, information concerning an event that would have a large impact on stock price, such as a merger, may be material even if the possibility that the event will occur is relatively small. When in doubt about whether particular nonpublic information is material, you should presume it is material. If you are unsure whether information is material, you should either consult the Compliance Officer before making

any decision to disclose such information (other than to persons who need to know it) or to trade in or recommend securities to which that information relates or assume that the information is material. 
 When Information is Considered Public 
 Information that has not been disclosed to the public generally is considered to be nonpublic information. In order to establish that the information has been disclosed to the public, the information must have been widely disseminated in a manner designed to reach investors generally (i.e., posting on a company website, or a filing with the SEC s EDGAR system) and investors must be given the opportunity to absorb the information. 
 By contrast, nonpublic information may include (i) information available only to a select group of analysts, brokers, or institutional investors (ii) undisclosed facts that are the subject of rumors and (iii) information that has been entrusted to the Company on a confidential basis until a public announcement has been made and enough time has elapsed for the market to respond i.e., the second business day after the information was publicly released. Depending on the particular circumstances, the Company may determine that a longer or shorter period should apply to the release of specific material nonpublic information. 
 If you are not sure whether information is considered public, you either should consult with the Compliance Officer, or presume that the information is nonpublic and treat it as confidential. 
 Exception Transactions Under Company Plans 
 This Policy does not apply in the case of the following transactions, except as specifically noted 
 a. Stock Option Exercises This Policy does not apply to the exercise of an employee stock option acquired pursuant to the Company s plans, or to the exercise of a tax withholding right where you elect to have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements. However, this Policy does apply to any sale of stock as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option, or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of, or withholding in connection with the exercise of, an option. 
 b. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards This Policy does not apply to the vesting of restricted stock, or the exercise of a tax withholding right where you elect to have the Company withhold shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of any restricted stock or restricted stock units. Note, however, that this Policy does apply to any market sale of shares of the Company s stock. 
 c. 401(k) Plan This Policy does not apply to purchases of Company Securities in the Company s 401(k) plan resulting from your periodic contribution of money to the plan pursuant to your payroll deduction election. This Policy does apply, however, to certain elections you may make under the 401(k) plan, including (a) an election to increase or decrease the percentage of your periodic contributions that will be allocated to the Company stock fund (b) an election to make an intra-plan transfer of an existing account balance into or out of the Company stock fund (c) an election to borrow money against your 401(k) plan account if the loan will result in

a liquidation of some or all of your Company stock fund balance and (d) an election to pre-pay a plan loan if the pre-payment will result in allocation of loan proceeds to the Company stock fund. It should be noted that sales of Company Securities from a 401(k) account are also subject to Rule 144, and therefore affiliates should ensure that a Form 144 is filed when required. 
 d. Employee Stock Purchase Plan This Policy does not apply to purchases of Company Securities in the employee stock purchase plan resulting from your periodic contribution of money to the plan pursuant to the election you made at the time of your enrollment in the plan. This Policy also does not apply to purchases of Company Securities resulting from lump sum contributions to the plan, provided that you elected to participate by lump sum payment at the beginning of the applicable enrollment period. This Policy does apply, however, to your election to participate in the plan for any enrollment period, and to your sales of Company Securities purchased pursuant to the plan. 
 e. Dividend Reinvestment Plan . This Policy does not apply to purchases of Company Securities under the Company s dividend reinvestment plan resulting from your reinvestment of dividends paid on Company Securities. This Policy does apply, however, to voluntary purchases of Company Securities resulting from additional contributions you choose to make to the dividend reinvestment plan, and to your election to participate in the plan or increase your level of participation in the plan. This Policy also applies to your sale of any Company Securities purchased pursuant to the plan. 
 f. Other Similar Company Transactions Any other purchase of Company Securities from the Company or sales of Company Securities to the Company are not subject to this Policy. 
 Exception Transactions Not Involving a Purchase or Sale 
 This Policy does not apply in the case of the following transactions, except as specifically noted 
 a. Bona Fide Gifts of Securities Bona fide gifts of securities are not transactions subject to this Policy, unless you have reason to believe that the recipient intends to sell the Company Securities while you are in possession of material, nonpublic information, or the person making the gift is subject to the trading restrictions specified below under the heading Additional Procedures and the sales by the recipient of the Company Securities occur during a blackout period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, members of the Board of Directors and Section 16 Officers and any other individuals subject to Section 16 shall be obligated to report any bona fide gifts on Form 4 or Form 5, as applicable pursuant to Rule 16a-3(g)(1). 
 
 Prohibited Transactions 
 The Board of Directors of the Company believes that it is inappropriate for persons covered by this Policy (except as described in clause (d) below) to engage in any short-term or speculative transactions involving Company Securities, not only because of insider trading concerns but also because of the pejorative appearance created by the transactions and the potential repercussions with investors,

regulations, and other market participants. As a result, this Policy prohibits you from engaging in the following transactions. 
 a. Short Sales , or the sale of a security that the seller does not own, may evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value, and therefore signal to the market that the seller lacks confidence in the Company. In addition, short sales may reduce a seller s incentive to seek to improve the Company s performance. For these reasons, short sales of Company Securities are prohibited. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Exchange Act explicitly prohibits officers and directors from engaging in short sales. (Short sales arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by the paragraph below captioned Hedging Transactions. 
 b. Publicly-Traded Options , including put options, call options or other derivative securities, on an exchange or in any other organized market, are prohibited by this Policy. Given the relatively short term of publicly-traded options, transactions in options may create the appearance that you are trading based on material nonpublic information and inappropriately focus your attention on short-term performance at the expense of long-term objectives. (Short sales arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by the paragraph below captioned Hedging Transactions. 
 c. Standing and Limit Orders Except under approved Rule 10b5-1 Plans, you may not enter into standing and limit riders, due to the lack of control over the timing of purchases or sales that result from standing instructions to a broker. If a person subject to this Policy determines that they must use a standing order or limit order, the order should be limited to short duration and should otherwise comply with the restrictions and procedures outlined below under the heading Additional Procedures. 
 d. Pension Plan Blackout Periods . Members of the Board of Directors and the Company s executive officers are prohibited from trading in the Company's equity securities during a blackout period imposed under an individual account retirement or pension plan of the Company, during which at least 50 of the plan participants are unable to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer an interest in equity securities of the Company, due to a temporary suspension of trading by the Company or the plan fiduciary. 
 e. Short-Term Trading . Short-term trading of Company Securities may be distracting to the person and may unduly focus the person on the Company s short-term stock market performance instead of the Company s long-term business objectives. For these reasons, any person covered by this Policy who purchases Company Securities in the open market may not sell any Company Securities of the same class during the six months following the purchase (or vice versa). 
 f. Hedging Transactions . Hedging or monetization transactions can be accomplished through a number of possible mechanisms, including through the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds. Such transactions may permit a person covered by this Policy to continue to own Company Securities obtained through employee benefit plans or otherwise, but without the full risks and rewards of

ownership. When that occurs, such person may no longer have the same objectives as the Company s other shareholders. Therefore, persons covered by this Policy are prohibited from engaging in any such transactions. 
 g. Margin Accounts and Pledged Securities . Securities held in a margin account as collateral for a margin loan may be sold by the broker without the customer s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Because a margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Company Securities, persons covered by this Policy are prohibited from holding Company Securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging Company Securities as collateral for a loan. (Pledges of Company Securities arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by the paragraph above captioned Hedging Transactions. 
 
 Consequences of Violations 
 Violations of this Policy and insider trading laws have serious consequences. 
 a. Legal Penalties A person who violates insider trading laws by engaging in transactions in a company's securities when he or she has material non-public information can be sentenced to a substantial jail term and required to pay a penalty of several times the amount of profits gained or losses avoided. In addition, a person who tips others also may be liable for transactions by the tippees to whom he or she has disclosed material nonpublic information. Tippers can be subject to the same penalties and sanctions as the tippees, and the SEC has imposed large penalties even when the tipper did not profit from the transaction. The SEC also can seek substantial penalties from any person who, at the time of an insider trading violation, directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed such violation, which would apply to the Company and or management and supervisory personnel. These control persons may be held liable for up to the greater of 1 million or three times the amount of the profits gained or losses avoided. Even for violations that result in a small or no profit, the SEC can seek a minimum of 1 million from a company and or management and supervisory personnel as control persons. 
 b. Company-Imposed Penalties Employees who violate this Policy may be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, including dismissal for cause, whether or not the employee s failure to comply results in a violation of law. Any exceptions to this Policy, if permitted, may only be granted by the Compliance Officer and must be provided before any activity contrary to the above requirements takes place. 
 Company Assistance 
 Any person who has a question about this Policy or its application to any proposed transaction may obtain additional guidance from the Compliance Officer, Brian D. Walters, who can be reached by telephone at 412-442-8217 or by e-mail at bwalters matw.com.

PART II OF THIS POLICY ON INSIDER TRADING 
 THIS PART II OF THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ONLY THE FOLLOWING PERSONS 
 MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
 ANY OF THE COMPANY S SECTION 16 OFFICERS 
 THE COMPANY S COMPLIANCE OFFICER, THE ATTORNEYS WITHIN THE COMPANY S LEGAL DEPARTMENT, THE CORPORATE TREASURER AND THE CORPORATE CONTROLLER (COLLECTIVELY, THE COVERED LEADERSHIP TEAM AND 
 ANY EMPLOYEE WHO RECEIVED AN EQUITY AWARD FROM THE COMPANY (TOGETHER WITH THE COVERED LEADERSHIP TEAM, THE COVERED PERSONS 
 Additional Procedures 
 The Company has established additional procedures in order to assist the Company in the administration of this Policy, to facilitate compliance with laws prohibiting insider trading while in possession of material nonpublic information, and to avoid the appearance of any impropriety. These additional procedures are applicable only to Covered Persons, as well as the Family Members and Controlled Entities of such persons, since such persons are likely to obtain material nonpublic information on a regular basis. 
 a. Pre-Clearance Procedures 1 
 The Covered Leadership Team, as well as any Family Members and Controlled Entities of such persons, may not engage in any transaction in Company Securities including purchasing, selling or otherwise making any transfer of Company Securities (such as gifts, pledges or loans), without first obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from the Compliance Officer. 2 A request for pre-clearance should be submitted to the Compliance Officer at least two (2) business days in advance of the proposed transaction. 
 The Compliance Officer is under no obligation to approve a transaction submitted for pre-clearance, and may determine not to permit the transaction. If a person seeks pre-clearance and permission to engage in the transaction is denied, then he or she should refrain from initiating any transaction in Company Securities, and should not inform any other person of the restriction. When a request for pre-clearance is made, the requestor should carefully consider whether he or she may be aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company, and should describe fully those circumstances to the 
 
 1 Unless otherwise stated by the Compliance Officer, the pre-clearance will only be valid for a period of five (5) trading days from the date the clearance is given. 
 2 In the case of pre-clearance for any transaction by the Compliance Officer, the Company s Chairman, CEO or CFO, as the case may be, may provide pre-clearance to the Compliance Officer.

Compliance Officer. The requestor should also indicate whether he or she has effected any non-exempt opposite-way transactions within the past six months, and should be prepared to report the proposed transaction on an appropriate Form 4 or Form 5. The requestor should also be prepared to comply with SEC Rule 144 and file Form 144, if necessary, at the time of any sale. Unless revoked, pre-clearance granted by the Compliance Officer will ordinarily remain valid until the close of trading five (5) trading days following the day on which it is granted. If the transaction does not occur during the two-day period, pre-clearance of the transaction must be re-requested. Following completion of the transaction, the Covered Person shall promptly notify the Compliance officer, but in no event later than one (1) business day following completion of such transaction. 
 b. Quarterly Trading Restrictions The Covered Persons, as well as the Family Members and Controlled Entities of such persons, may not conduct any transactions involving Company Securities (other than as specified by this Policy), during a Blackout Period beginning at the close of market fifteen (15) days prior to the end of each fiscal quarter and ending at the close of market on the second business day following the date of the public release of the Company s earnings results for that fiscal quarter or fiscal year on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, respectively. For example, if a Company s fiscal quarter ended on June 30th, the Blackout Period would commence starting at 12 01 a.m. on June 15th and would end two business days after the Company s filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the June 30th fiscal period. In other words, these persons may only conduct transactions in Company Securities during the Window Period beginning on the third business day following the public release of the Company s earnings for that fiscal quarter or fiscal year on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K and ending at the close of market on the 15th day prior to the close of the next fiscal quarter. 
 c. Event-Specific Trading Restriction Periods From time to time, an event may occur that is material to the Company and is known by only a certain number of Covered Persons. So long as the event remains material and nonpublic, those specific Covered Persons (who have knowledge) may not trade Company Securities. In these cases, the Compliance Officer will provide notice (usually by email) indicating that there is an event-specific trading restriction period. 
 In addition, the Company s financial results may be sufficiently material in a particular fiscal quarter that, in the judgment of the Compliance Officer, a Covered Person should refrain from trading in Company Securities even sooner than the typical Blackout Period described above. In that situation, the Compliance Officer will notify the Covered Persons that they should not trade in the Company s Securities without disclosing the reason for the restriction. 
 The existence of an event-specific trading restriction period or extension of a Blackout Period will not be announced to the Company as a whole, and should not be communicated to any other person. Even if the Compliance Officer has not designated a Covered Person as a person who should not trade due to an event-specific restriction, such person should not trade while aware of material nonpublic information. Exceptions will not be granted during an event-specific trading restriction period.

d. Exceptions The quarterly trading restrictions and event-driven trading restrictions do not apply to those transactions, as described above under the headings, Exception Transactions Under Company Plans and Exception Transactions Not Involving a Purchase or Sale. Further, the requirement for pre-clearance, the quarterly trading restrictions and event-specific trading restrictions do not apply to transactions conducted pursuant to approved Rule 10b5-1 plans, described under the heading Rule 10b5-1 Plans. 
 e. Written Updates or Schedule The Compliance Officer shall be responsible for providing written (which may be by email) updates and or a yearly schedule on when Blackout Periods begin and end. The Compliance Officer shall be responsible for updating such schedule and for providing sufficient communications related event-specific trading restrictions. 
 Rule 10b5-1 Plans 
 Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides a defense from insider trading liability under Rule 10b-5. In order to be eligible to rely on this defense, a person subject to this Policy must enter into a Rule 10b5-1 plan for transactions in Company Securities that meets certain conditions specified in the Rule (a Rule 10b5-1 Plan ). If the plan meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1, Company Securities may be purchased or sold without regard to certain insider trading restrictions. To comply with the Policy, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be approved by the Compliance Officer and meet the following requirements (each an Approved 10b5-1 Plan 
 a. it has been reviewed and approved by the Compliance Officer at least five business days in advance of being entered into (or, if revised or amended, such proposed revisions or amendments have been reviewed and approved by the Compliance Officer at least five business days in advance of being entered into) 
 b. it provides that no trades may occur thereunder until expiration of the applicable cooling-off period specified in Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), and no trades occur until after that time. The appropriate cooling-off period will vary based on the status of the Covered Person. For directors and officers, the cooling-off period ends on the later of (x) ninety days after adoption or certain modifications of the 10b5-1 plan or (y) two business days following disclosure of the Company's financial results in a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K for the quarter in which the 10b5-1 plan was adopted. For all other Covered Persons, the cooling-off period ends 30 days after adoption or modification of the 10b5-1 plan. This required cooling-off period will apply to the entry into a new 10b5-1 plan and any revision or modification of a 10b5-1 plan 
 c. it is entered into in good faith by the Covered Person, and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1, at a time when the Covered Person is not in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company and, if the Covered Person is a director or officer, the 10b5-1 plan must include representations by the Covered Person certifying to that effect 
 d. it gives a third party the discretionary authority to execute such purchases and sales, outside the control of the Covered Person, so long as such third party does not possess any material nonpublic information about the Company or explicitly specifies the security or securities to

be purchased or sold, the number of shares, the prices and or dates of transactions, or other formula(s) describing such transactions and 
 e. it is the only outstanding Approved 10b5-1 Plan entered into by the Covered Person (subject to the exceptions set out in Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(ii)(D)). 
 No Approved 10b5-1 Plan may be adopted during a Blackout Period. 
 If you are considering entering into, modifying or terminating an Approved 10b5-1 Plan or have any questions regarding Approved Rule 10b5-1 Plans, please contact the Compliance Officer. You should consult your own legal and tax advisors before entering into, or modifying or terminating, an Approved 10b5-1 Plan. A trading plan, contract, instruction or arrangement will not qualify as an Approved 10b5-1 Plan without the prior review and approval of the Compliance Officer as described above. 
 Section 16 Reporting 
 For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the pre-clearance procedures set forth in this Policy or the approval of an Approved 10b5-1 Plan, Company Insiders remain obligated to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 under Section 16 of the Exchange Act in connection with most sales, purchases, bona fide gifts or certain other transactions in Company Securities. If any questions arise, such Company Insider should consult with their own counsel in connection with any transaction, including pursuant to an Approved 10b5-1 Plan. 
 Post-Termination Transactions 
 This Policy continues to apply to transactions in Company Securities even after termination of service to the Company. If an individual is in possession of material nonpublic information when his or her service terminates, that individual may not trade in Company Securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. The pre-clearance procedures specified under the heading Additional Procedures above, however, will cease to apply to transactions in Company Securities upon the termination of service to the Company. 
 Certification 
 The Covered Leadership Team members must certify their understanding of, and intent to comply with, this Policy.
