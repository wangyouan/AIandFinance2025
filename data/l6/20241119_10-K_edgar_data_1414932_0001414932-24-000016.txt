PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 General 
 Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation, a Delaware corporation, or together with its subsidiaries, where applicable, the Company, which may also be referred to as we, us or our , is a specialty finance company dedicated to providing customized, one-stop credit solutions to companies with limited access to public or syndicated capital markets. We were formed in late 2007 and currently operate as a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. In addition, we have qualified and elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for tax purposes. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or net realized capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders if we meet certain source-of-income, income distribution and asset diversification requirements. 
 We are externally managed by Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC, which we also refer to as Oaktree or our Adviser, pursuant to an investment advisory agreement, as amended from time to time, or the Investment Advisory Agreement, between the Company and Oaktree. Oaktree is an affiliate of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., or OCM, the Company's external investment adviser from October 17, 2017 through May 3, 2020, and is under common control of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC, or OCG. In 2019, Brookfield Corporation (f/k/a Brookfield Asset Management Inc.), which collectively with its affiliates we refer to as "Brookfield," acquired a majority economic interest in OCG. OCG operates as an independent business within Brookfield, with its own product offerings and investment, marketing and support teams. Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC, which we refer to as Oaktree Administrator, a subsidiary of OCM, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate. 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by providing companies with flexible and innovative financing solutions, including first and second lien loans, unsecured and mezzanine loans, bonds, preferred equity and certain equity co-investments. We may also seek to generate capital appreciation and income through secondary investments at discounts to par in either private or syndicated transactions. Our portfolio may also include certain structured finance and other non-traditional structures. We invest in companies that typically possess resilient business models with strong underlying fundamentals. We intend to deploy capital across credit and economic cycles with a focus on long-term results, which we believe will enable us to build lasting partnerships with financial sponsors and management teams, and we may seek to opportunistically take advantage of dislocations in the financial markets and other situations that may benefit from our Adviser s credit and structuring expertise. Sponsors may include financial sponsors, such as an institutional investor or a private equity firm, or a strategic entity seeking to invest in a portfolio company. 
 Our Adviser is generally focused on middle-market companies, which we define as companies with enterprise values of between 100 million and 750 million. We expect our portfolio to include a mix of first and second lien loans, including asset backed loans, unitranche loans, mezzanine loans, unsecured loans, bonds, preferred equity and certain equity co-investments. Our portfolio may also include certain structured finance and other non-traditional structures. We generally invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as high yield and junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 
 Our portfolio totaled billion at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and was composed of portfolio companies. These included debt investments in 122 companies, equity investments in 42 companies and our investments in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC, or SLF JV I, a joint venture through which we and Trinity Universal Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Kemper Corporation, or Kemper, co-invest in senior secured loans of middle-market companies and other corporate debt securities, and OCSI Glick JV LLC, or the Glick JV, a joint venture through which we and GF Equity Funding 2014 LLC, or GF Equity Funding, co-invest primarily in senior secured loans of middle-market companies. 22 of our equity investments were in companies in which we also had a debt investment. At fair value, 94.2 of our portfolio consisted of debt investments, including our debt investments in SLF JV I and Glick JV, and 85.2 of our portfolio consisted of senior secured loans as of September 30, 2024. The weighted average annual yield of our debt investments at fair value as of September 30, 2024, including the return on our debt investments in SLF JV I and Glick JV, was approximately 11.2 , including 10.0 representing cash payments. The weighted average annual yield of our debt investments is determined before the payment of, and therefore does not take into account, our expenses and the payment by an investor of any stockholder transaction expenses, and does not represent the return on investment for our stockholders. See Investments SLF JV I and Investments Glick JV below for additional information regarding our investments in SLF JV I and Glick JV.

We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a Business Development Company, subject to certain limited exceptions, we are currently only allowed to borrow amounts in accordance with the asset coverage requirements in the Investment Company Act. We generally expect to target a long-term debt to equity ratio of 0.90x to 1.25x (i.e., one dollar of equity for each 0.90 to 1.25 of debt outstanding). As of September 30, 2024, we had a net debt to equity ratio of 1.07x (i.e., one dollar of equity for each 1.07 of debt outstanding). At a special meeting of stockholders held on June 28, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act to us, effective as of June 29, 2019. As a result of the reduced asset coverage requirement, we can incur 2 of debt for each 1 of equity. 
 On March 19, 2021, we acquired Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation, or OCSI, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the OCSI Merger Agreement, dated as of October 28, 2020, by and among OCSI, us, Lion Merger Sub, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, Oaktree. Pursuant to the OCSI Merger Agreement, OCSI was merged with and into us in a two-step transaction, with us as the surviving company, or the OCSI Merger. 
 On January 23, 2023, we acquired Oaktree Strategic Income II, Inc., or OSI2, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the OSI2 Merger Agreement, dated as of September 14, 2022, by and among OSI2, us, Project Superior Merger Sub, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, Oaktree. Pursuant to the OSI2 Merger Agreement, OSI2 was merged with and into us in a two-step transaction, with us as the surviving company, or the OSI2 Merger and, together with the OCSI Merger, the Mergers. 
 Our Adviser 
 We are externally managed and advised by Oaktree, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. Oaktree, subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory services to us pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 Our Adviser is an affiliate of OCM, a leading global investment management firm headquartered in Los Angeles, California, focused on less efficient markets and alternative investments. A number of the senior executives and investment professionals of our Adviser and its affiliates have been investing together for over 35 years and have generated impressive investment performance through multiple market cycles. Our Adviser and its affiliates emphasize an opportunistic, value-oriented and risk-controlled approach to investments in distressed debt, corporate debt (including high-yield debt and senior loans), control investing, real estate, convertible securities and listed equities. 
 In 2019, Brookfield acquired a majority economic interest in OCG. OCG operates as an independent business within Brookfield, with its own product offerings and investment, marketing and support teams. Brookfield is a leading global alternative asset manager with over a 100 year history and approximately 1 trillion of assets under management (inclusive of OCG) across a broad portfolio of real estate, infrastructure, renewable power, credit and private equity assets. OCG's founders, senior management and current and former employee-unitholders of OCG are able to sell their remaining OCG units to Brookfield over time pursuant to an agreed upon liquidity schedule and approach to valuing such units at the time of liquidation. Pursuant to this liquidity schedule, the earliest year in which Brookfield could own 100 of the OCG business is 2029. 
 The primary firm-wide goal of our Adviser and OCM is to achieve attractive returns while bearing less than commensurate risk. Our Adviser believes that it can achieve this goal by taking advantage of market inefficiencies in which financial markets and their participants fail to accurately value assets or fail to make available to companies the capital that they reasonably require. 
 Oaktree believes that its defining characteristic is adherence to the highest professional standards, which has yielded several important benefits. First and foremost, this characteristic has allowed Oaktree to attract and retain a talented group of investment professionals, or the Investment Professionals, as well as accounting, valuation, legal, compliance and other administrative professionals. As of September 30, 2024, Oaktree had more than 1,200 professionals in 21 cities and 17 countries, including a deep and broad credit platform drawing from more than 350 highly experienced investment professionals with significant origination, structuring and underwriting expertise. Specifically, the Strategic Credit group that is primarily responsible for implementing our investment strategy consists of approximately 40 Investment Professionals led by Armen Panossian, our Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chief Investment Officer, who focus on the investment strategy employed by our Adviser and certain of its affiliates. Second, it has permitted the investment team to build strong relationships with brokers, banks and other market participants. These institutional relationships have been instrumental in strengthening access to trading opportunities, to understanding the current market, and to executing the investment team s investment strategies. OCM aims to attract, motivate and retain talented employees (both Investment Professionals and accounting, valuation, legal, compliance and other administrative professionals) by making them active participants in, and beneficiaries of, the platform s success. In addition to competitive base salaries, all OCM employees share in the discretionary bonus pool. An employee s participation in 
 3 

the bonus pool is based on the overall success of our Adviser and its affiliates and the individual employee s performance and level of responsibility. 
 Our Adviser and its affiliates provide discretionary investment management services to other managed accounts and investment funds, which may have overlapping investment objectives and strategies with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. The activities of such managed accounts and investment funds may raise actual or potential conflicts of interest. 
 Strategic Credit 
 Our Adviser's affiliates officially launched the Strategic Credit strategy in early 2013 as a step-out from the Distressed Debt strategy to capture attractive investment opportunities that appear to offer too little return for distressed debt investors, but may pose too much uncertainty for high-yield bond creditors. The strategy seeks to achieve an attractive total return by investing in public and private revenue-generating, performing debt. 
 Strategic Credit focuses on U.S. and non-U.S. investment opportunities that arise from pricing inefficiencies that occur in the primary and secondary markets or from the financing needs of healthy companies with limited access to traditional lenders or public markets. Typical investments will be in high yield bonds and senior secured loans for borrowers that are in need of direct loans, rescue financings, or other capital solutions or that have had challenged or unsuccessful primary offerings. 
 The Investment Professionals employ a fundamental, value-driven opportunistic approach to credit investing, which seeks to benefit from the resources, relationships and proprietary information of the global investment platform of our Adviser and its affiliates. 
 Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance 
 Oaktree takes account of environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, considerations as part of its investment process. In September 2019, Oaktree became a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment, or PRI. Oaktree believes that the tenets of the PRI are well-aligned with Oaktree s mission of delivering superior investment results with risk under control, and complementary to not in conflict with its investment philosophy. Oaktree s adoption of the PRI reflects broad-based support for incorporating environmental, social and corporate governance considerations when making investments. OCM s ESG policy, or the ESG Policy, was first adopted and published in 2014, and since then Oaktree has continued to refine its approach. The firm recognizes that material ESG issues can directly impact investment performance. Accordingly, Oaktree s Strategic Credit team follows Oaktree s ESG Policy and regularly assesses ESG-related factors as part of the team s investment process in a manner it believes is consistent with relevant regulatory requirements and its fiduciary obligations to maximize profits for its funds and accounts. 
 The ability of Oaktree s Strategic Credit team to assess and influence material ESG issues varies by investment. Situations where Oaktree has access to full due diligence and where it obtains control allow Oaktree to better detect and address material ESG issues relative to situations where it may be limited to public information or have a non-controlling investment. In evaluating an existing or prospective investment, Oaktree s Strategic Credit investment professionals generally seek to (a) identify material ESG issues that may affect the investment, (b) analyze the relative importance of, and risk posed by, any identified material ESG issue, (c) consider the costs and benefits of potential remedial measures, and (d) assess its ability to influence change to mitigate material ESG-related risks and/or meet relevant regulatory obligations. Based on the foregoing analysis, Oaktree may seek to foster change in some circumstances or even forgo investments in others. Oaktree s Strategic Credit team seeks to, where possible, advance ESG practices through the interactions of its investment professionals with the management of existing and prospective portfolio companies and their advisers. Oaktree seeks to ensure that, where possible, portfolio company management appreciates the financial ramifications of such issues and has the benefit of Oaktree s insight with respect to the approaches being taken across a wide variety of industries and companies. 
 Our Administrator 
 We entered into an administration agreement, as amended from time to time, or the Administration Agreement, with Oaktree Administrator, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of OCM. The principal executive offices of Oaktree Administrator are located at 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, Oaktree Administrator provides services to us, and we reimburse Oaktree Administrator for costs and expenses incurred by Oaktree Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement and providing personnel and facilities thereunder.

Business Strategy 
 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by providing companies with flexible and innovative financing solutions, including first and second lien loans, unsecured and mezzanine loans, bonds, preferred equity and certain equity co-investments. We may also seek to generate capital appreciation and income through secondary investments at discounts to par in either private or syndicated transactions. We invest in companies across a variety of industries that typically possess resilient business models with strong underlying fundamentals. We deploy capital across credit and economic cycles with a focus on long-term results, which we believe will enable us to build lasting partnerships with financial sponsors and management teams, and we may seek to opportunistically take advantage of dislocations in the financial markets and other situations that may benefit from our Adviser s deep credit and structuring expertise. Our Adviser intends to implement the following business strategy to achieve our investment objective: 
 
 Emphasis on Proprietary Deals. Our Adviser is focused on proprietary opportunities as well as partnering with other lenders as appropriate. Dedicated sourcing professionals of our Adviser and its affiliates are in continuous contact with financial sponsors and corporate clients to originate proprietary deals and seek to leverage the networks and relationships of Oaktree s Investment Professionals with management teams and corporations to originate non-sponsored transactions. The platform has the capacity to invest in large deals and to solely underwrite transactions. 
 
 Focus on Quality Companies and Extensive Diligence. Our Adviser seeks to maintain a conservative approach to investing with discipline around fundamental credit analysis and downside protection. Our Adviser intends to focus on companies with resilient business models, strong underlying fundamentals, significant asset or enterprise value and seasoned management teams, although not all portfolio companies will meet each of these criteria. Our Adviser intends to leverage its deep credit and deal structuring expertise to lend to companies that have unique needs, complex business models or specific business challenges. Our Adviser conducts diligence on underlying collateral value, including cash flows, hard assets or intellectual property, and will typically model exit scenarios as part of the diligence process, including assessing potential work-out scenarios. 
 
 Disciplined Portfolio Management. Our Adviser monitors our portfolio on an ongoing basis to manage risk and take preemptive action to resolve potential problems where possible. Our Adviser intends to seek to reduce the impact of individual investment risks by diversifying portfolios across industry sectors and generally limiting positions to no more than 5 of our portfolio. 
 
 Manage Risk Through Loan Structures. Our Adviser seeks to leverage its experience in identifying structural risks in prospective portfolio companies and developing customized solutions to enhance downside protection where possible. Our Adviser has the expertise to structure comprehensive, flexible and customized solutions for companies of all sizes across numerous industry sectors. Our Adviser employs a rigorous due diligence process and seeks to include covenant protections designed to ensure that we, as the lender, can negotiate with a portfolio company before a debt investment reaches impairment. The platform of our Adviser and its affiliates can address a wide range of borrower needs, with capability to invest across the capital structure and to fund large loans, and our Adviser pays close attention to market trends. Our Adviser provides certainty to borrowers by seeking to provide fully underwritten financing commitments and has expertise in both performing credit as well as restructuring and turnaround situations, which allows us to lend at times of market stress when our competitors may halt or reduce investment activity. 
 
 Our Adviser s emphasis is on fundamental credit analysis, consistency and downside protection, all of which are key tenets of its investment philosophy and important in times of market dislocation. We believe this philosophy strongly aligns with the interests of our stockholders. Our Adviser controls primarily for risk, rather than return. Although this may lead us to underperform in bullish markets, we expect that prudence across the economic cycle and limiting losses will allow us to achieve our investment objectives. 
 Identification of Investment Opportunities 
 Our primary focus is on identifying differentiated private lending opportunities, with a secondary emphasis on identifying opportunities in the public markets. 
 Private Lending Opportunities. We believe that the market for lending to private companies is underserved and presents a compelling investment opportunity. We intend to focus on private lending opportunities in the following key areas: 
 
 Non-Sponsor Situational Lending. Certain businesses (including those with complex business models or specific business challenges) may present challenges for traditional lenders to understand or value, thus presenting attractive 
 5 

lending opportunities for the Company. Prospective borrowers with little-to-no revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, may be unable to secure financing from traditional lenders. In these instances, a debt-to-EBITDA approach may not be appropriate, instead requiring a value-oriented approach that involves targeting low loan-to-value ratios and negotiating highly-structured investments with bespoke covenants, contingencies and terms that help mitigate business-specific risks. Examples of these opportunities may include life sciences companies that are unable to access traditional bank financing to commercialize their product pipelines. 
 
 Select Sponsor-Related Financings. Financing for portfolio companies backed by private equity firms is one the most active areas of opportunity, including those opportunities related to leveraged buyouts and refinancings. The Investment Professionals have many longstanding relationships with established, reputable sponsors and generally favor those that view their portfolio companies as long-term partners and those that specialize in certain industries where they have significant subject matter expertise. In addition, the Investment Professionals have historically favored borrowers backed by sponsors that have demonstrated a willingness to invest large amounts of equity, which provides enhanced downside protection. Examples of these opportunities may include financings for software- or healthcare-focused borrowers backed by private equity firms. 
 
 Stressed Sector/Rescue Lending . Individual businesses or sectors experiencing stress or reduced access to capital can create attractive private lending opportunities. Broad market weakness or sector-specific issues can constrain borrowers access to capital. Further, certain factors such as regulation may cause entire industries (e.g., energy) to be rebuffed by more traditional lenders (e.g., commercial banks) such that all borrowers in the industry lose access to capital, regardless of their individual financial condition. Oftentimes, by sifting through an industry issuer-by-issuer, the Investment Professionals can identify attractive investment opportunities that are over-secured by valuable assets. Examples of these opportunities may include debtor-in-possession loans or loans to companies in sectors temporarily impacted by macro events. 
 
 Opportunities in Public Markets. Certain factors may also drive opportunities for us in the public market and will allow us to leverage broader credit platform and decades of credit investing experience of Oaktree and its affiliates. These factors may include: 
 
 Macro Factors. Macro factors that drive market dislocations can ripple through the global economy and include sovereign debt crises, political elections, global pandemics and other unexpected geopolitical events. These factors drive highly correlated risk on and risk off market swings and frequently result in the indiscriminate selling of securities and obligations at prices that the Investment Professionals believe are well below their intrinsic values. 
 
 Industry Headwinds . Select industries may face secular challenges or may fall out of favor due to a variety of factors such as evolving technology or regulation. These headwinds can cause the debt of healthy and unhealthy companies alike to trade lower, potentially allowing the Investment Professionals to identify mispriced opportunities. 
 
 Company Characteristics. Company-specific factors that drive market dislocations include overleveraged balance sheets, near-term liquidity or maturity issues, secular pressures, acute shock to company operations, asset-light businesses and new or relatively small issuers. These factors may result in mispriced securities or obligations or require a highly structured direct loan. 
 
 The securities we may purchase in the public markets include broadly syndicated loans, high yield bonds and structured credit products. We generally expect to have smaller positions in these securities, and to hold such securities for a shorter period of time, relative to securities purchased in private lending opportunities. 
 Investment Criteria and Guidelines 
 Once the Investment Professionals have identified a potential investment opportunity, they will evaluate the opportunity against the following investment criteria and guidelines. However, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we invest. 
 
 Covenant Protections. We generally expect to invest in loans that have covenants that may help to minimize our risk of capital loss and meaningful equity investments in the portfolio company. We intend to target investments that have strong credit protections, including default penalties, information rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, such as limitations on debt incurrence, lien protection and prohibitions on dividends. 
 
 6 

Sustainable Cash Flow. Our investment philosophy places emphasis on fundamental analysis from an investor s perspective and has a distinct value orientation. We intend to focus on companies with significant asset or enterprise value in which we can invest at relatively low multiples of normalized operating cash flow. Additionally, we anticipate investing in companies with a demonstrated ability or credible plan to de-lever. Typically, we will not invest in start-up companies or companies having speculative business plans or structures that could impair capital over the long-term although we may target certain earlier stage companies that have yet to reach profitability. 
 
 Experienced Management Team. We generally will look to invest in portfolio companies with an experienced management team and proper incentive arrangements, including equity compensation, to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors. 
 
 Strong Relative Position in Its Market. We intend to target companies with what we believe to be established and leading market positions within their respective markets and well-developed long-term business strategies. 
 
 Exit Strategy. We generally intend to invest in companies that we believe will provide us with the opportunity to exit our investments in three to eight years, including through (1) the repayment of the remaining principal outstanding at maturity, (2) the recapitalization of the company resulting in our debt investments being repaid or (3) the sale of the company resulting in the repayment of all of its outstanding debt. 
 
 Geography. As a Business Development Company, we will invest at least 70 of our total assets in U.S. companies. To the extent we invest in non-U.S. companies, we intend to do so only in jurisdictions with established legal frameworks and a history of respecting creditor rights. 
 
 Investment Process 
 
 Our investment process consists of the following five distinct stages. 
 Source 
 Our Adviser has several resources for originating new opportunities that grant the Investment Professionals a comprehensive view of the actionable investment universe. From this universe, our Adviser can then select the most attractive opportunities for us. In addition to its dedicated group of sourcing professionals, our Adviser also leverages its strong global market presence and relationships with affiliates, advisers, sponsors, banks, management teams, capital-raising advisers, trading desks and other sources to gain access to opportunities that are consistent with our investment strategy. Our Adviser is a trusted partner to financial sponsors and management teams based on its best-in-class market reputation, relationship-based approach, long-term investment orientation and focus on lending across economic cycles. Our Adviser believes that this gives us access to proprietary deal flow and first looks at investment opportunities and that we are well-positioned for difficult and complex transactions. 
 Screen 
 We expect to be highly selective in making new investments. The initial screening process will typically include a review of the proposed capital structure of the prospective portfolio company, including level of assets or enterprise value coverage, an assessment by our Adviser of the company s management team and its equity ownership levels as well as the viability of its long-term business model, the target's performance against certain ESG considerations and a review of forecasted financial statements and liquidity profile. In addition, our Adviser may assess the prospect of industry or macroeconomic catalysts that may create enhanced value in the investment as well as the potential ability to enforce creditor rights, particularly where collateral is located outside of the United States. 
 Research 
 Once the Investment Professionals have identified a potential investment opportunity and prior to making any new investment, our Adviser will complete an extensive due diligence process led by investment analysts assigned to each transaction. The analysts will examine various elements of the prospective investment to assess its risks and ensure that it meets our investment criteria and guidelines. Throughout the underwriting process, the analysts typically consider the following to evaluate the opportunity: the company s management team, suite of products/services, competitive position in its markets, barriers to entry, valuation, operating and financial performance, organic and inorganic growth prospects, as well as the expansion potential of its markets. In performing this evaluation, the analysts may use financial, qualitative and other due diligence materials provided by the target company, commissioned third-party reports and internal sources, including our Adviser s relationships derived from the Investment Professionals, industry participants and experts. As part of their research, 
 7 

our Adviser s analysts will typically perform a what-if analysis that explores a range of values for each proposed investment and a range of potential credit events to understand how the investment may perform under several different scenarios. Our Adviser conducts diligence on underlying collateral value, including cash flows, hard assets or intellectual property, and will typically model exit scenarios as part of the diligence process, including assessing potential work-out scenarios. 
 Decide 
 The Investment Professionals will propose investments along with all due diligence findings to an investment committee of the Adviser, or the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee is a collaborative and consensus-driven body that employs a rigorous process to weigh the merits and risks of each prospective investment, make investment decisions and appropriately size investments within the portfolio on our behalf. The Investment Committee generally strives for full consensus, but ultimately requires majority approval to move forward with an investment. No single committee member has veto rights for an investment. Investment Committee members are appointed and serve at the sole discretion of Armen Panossian. 
 Monitor 
 Risk management is our Adviser's utmost priority. In managing our portfolio, our Adviser monitors each portfolio company to be well-positioned to make hold and exit decisions when credit events occur, our collateral becomes overvalued or opportunities with more attractive risk/reward profiles are identified. Investment analysts are assigned to each investment to monitor industry developments, review company financial statements, attend company presentations and regularly speak with company management. Based on their monitoring, the Investment Professionals seek to determine the optimal time and strategy for exiting and maximizing the return on the investment, typically when prices or yields reach target valuations. In circumstances where a particular investment is underperforming, our Adviser intends to employ a variety of strategies to maximize its recovery based on the specific facts and circumstances of the underperforming investment, including actively working with the management to restructure all or a portion of the business, explore the possibility of a sale or merger of all or a portion of the assets, recapitalize or refinance the balance sheet, negotiate deferrals or other concessions from existing creditors and arrange new liquidity or new equity contributions. We believe that our Adviser s experience with restructurings and our access to our Adviser s deep knowledge, expertise and contacts in the distressed debt area will help us preserve the value of our investments. 
 Investments 
 Debt Investments 
 At fair value, 94.2 of our portfolio consisted of debt investments and 85.2 of our portfolio consisted of senior secured loans as of September 30, 2024. Our debt investments generally consist of the following: 
 
 First Lien Loans. Our first lien loans generally have terms of three to seven years, provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, contain prepayment penalties and are secured by a first priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. Our first lien loans may take many forms, including revolving lines of credit, term loans and acquisition lines of credit. 
 
 Unitranche Loans. Our unitranche loans generally have terms of five to seven years and provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, contain prepayment penalties and are generally secured by a first priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. Our unitranche loans may take many forms, including revolving lines of credit, term loans and acquisition lines of credit. Unitranche loans typically provide a borrower with all of its capital except for common equity, often with higher interest rates than those associated with traditional first lien loans. 
 
 Second Lien Loans. Our second lien loans generally have terms of five to eight years, provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, contain prepayment penalties and are secured by a second priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. 
 
 Mezzanine Loans. Our mezzanine loans generally have maturities of five to ten years. Mezzanine loans may take the form of a second priority lien on the assets of a portfolio company and have interest-only payments in the early years with cash or PIK payments with amortization of principal deferred to the later years. In some cases, we may invest in debt securities that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. 
 
 8 

Unsecured Loans. Our unsecured investments generally have terms of five to ten years and provide for a fixed interest rate. We may make unsecured investments on a stand-alone basis, or in connection with a senior secured loan, a junior secured loan or a one-stop financing. 
 
 Bonds. We may selectively invest in high yield corporate bonds issued by middle-market companies that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. The bonds in which we may invest are expected to have terms of five to eight years and provide for fixed interest rate payments. We do not expect that these bonds would be secured by any assets of the issuer. 
 Equity Investments 
 When we make a debt investment, we may also be granted equity, such as warrants to purchase common stock in a portfolio company. To a lesser extent, we may also make preferred and/or common equity investments, which may be in conjunction with a concurrent debt investment or the result of an investment restructuring. For non-control equity investments, we generally seek to structure our non-control equity investments to provide us with minority rights provisions and event-driven put rights. We also seek to obtain limited registration rights in connection with these investments, which may include piggyback registration rights. 
 SLF JV I 
 We and Kemper co-invest through SLF JV I, an unconsolidated Delaware limited liability company, or LLC. SLF JV I was formed in May 2014 to invest in middle-market and other corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2024, we and Kemper had funded approximately 190.5 million to SLF JV I, of which 166.7 million was from us. As of September 30, 2024, we had aggregate commitments to fund SLF JV I of million, of which approximately million was to fund additional subordinated notes issued by SLF JV I, or the SLF JV I Notes, and approximately million was to fund LLC equity interests in SLF JV I. Additionally, SLF JV I has a revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., or the SLF JV I Facility, which permitted up to million of borrowings (subject to borrowing base and other limitations) as of September 30, 2024. Borrowings under the SLF JV I Facility are secured by all of the assets of a special purpose financing subsidiary of SLF JV I. SLF JV I is managed by a four-person Board of Directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by Kemper. SLF JV I is generally capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions must be approved by its investment committee consisting of one representative selected by us and one representative selected by Kemper (with approval of each required). As of September 30, 2024, our investment in SLF JV I was approximately million at fair value. We do not consolidate SLF JV I in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Glick JV 
 On March 19, 2021, as a result of the consummation of the OCSI Merger, we became party to the LLC agreement of the Glick JV. The Glick JV invests primarily in senior secured loans of middle-market companies. Approximately million in aggregate commitments was funded to the Glick JV as of September 30, 2024, of which million was from us. As of September 30, 2024, we had aggregate unfunded commitments to Glick JV of approximately 14.0 million, of which approximately million was to fund additional subordinated notes issued by the Glick JV, or the Glick JV Notes, and approximately million was to fund LLC equity interests in the Glick JV. The Glick JV has a revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., or the Glick JV Facility, which permitted borrowings of up to million (subject to borrowing base and other limitations) as of September 30, 2024. Borrowings under the Glick JV Facility are secured by all of the assets of a special purpose financing subsidiary of Glick JV. The Glick JV is managed by a four-person Board of Directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by GF Equity Funding. The Glick JV is generally capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions must be approved by its investment committee consisting of one representative selected by us and one representative selected by GF Equity Funding (with approval of each required). As of September 30, 2024, our investment in the Glick JV was approximately million at fair value. We do not consolidate Glick JV in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Valuation Procedures 
 As a Business Development Company, we generally invest in illiquid debt and equity securities issued by private middle-market companies. We are required to carry our portfolio investments at market value or, if there is no readily available market value, at fair value as determined in accordance with our valuation policies and procedures. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Investment Advisory Agreement 
 The following is a description of the Investment Advisory Agreement. The investment advisory agreement with Oaktree was amended and restated on March 19, 2021 in connection with the closing of the OCSI Merger, on January 23, 2023 in connection with the closing of the OSI2 Merger and on November 14, 2024 to reflect a reduced base management fee. The term Investment Advisory Agreement refers collectively to the agreements with Oaktree. 
 Management Services 
 Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, Oaktree manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory services. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, Oaktree: 
 
 determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; 
 identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make; 
 executes, closes, monitors and services the investments we make; 
 determines what securities and other assets we purchase, retain or sell; 
 performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; and 
 provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably required for the investment of our funds. 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that Oaktree s services are not exclusive to us and Oaktree is generally free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. 
 Management and Incentive Fee 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay Oaktree a fee for its services under the investment advisory agreement consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to Oaktree and any incentive fees earned by Oaktree is ultimately borne by our common stockholders. 
 Base Management Fee 
 Effective as of July 1, 2024, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00 of total gross assets, including any investment made with borrowings, but excluding cash and cash equivalents; provided, however, that for the period from July 1, 2024 to January 23, 2025, the base management is calculated at such an annual rate as to cause (1) the base management fee less (2) previously agreed waivers of 750,000 of base management fees per quarter (with such amount appropriately prorated for any partial quarter) to equal 1.00 of our gross assets, including any investments made with borrowings, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents. From May 3, 2019 through June 30, 2024, the base management fee was 1.50 of total gross assets, including any investments made with borrowings, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents, provided that the base management fee on gross assets that exceeded the product of (A) 200 and (B) the Company s net asset value was 1.00 . The 200 was calculated in accordance with the Investment Company Act. In connection with the OCSI Merger, we and Oaktree entered into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement, which among other items, waived an aggregate of 6 million of base management fees otherwise payable to Oaktree in the two years following the closing of the OCSI Merger on March 19, 2021 at a rate of 750,000 per quarter (with such amount appropriately prorated for any partial quarter). In connection with the OSI2 Merger, Oaktree waived an aggregate of 9.0 million of base management fees payable to Oaktree as follows: 6.0 million at a rate of 1.5 million per quarter (with such amount appropriately prorated for any partial quarter) in the first year following closing of the OSI2 Merger on January 23, 2023 and 3.0 million at a rate of 750,000 per quarter (with such amount appropriately prorated for any partial quarter) in the second year following closing of the OSI2 Merger. Oaktree also waived additional base management fees such that the total amount of waived base management fees (including those waived in connection with the OSI2 Merger described above) was 1.5 million for each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee consists of two parts. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the first part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the incentive fee on income or the Part I incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter. The payment of the incentive fee on income is subject to payment of a preferred return to investors each quarter (i.e., a hurdle rate ), expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the most recently completed quarter, of 1.50 , subject to a catch up feature. 
 10 

For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies, other than fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the fiscal quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, or OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. In addition, pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any amortization or accretion of any purchase premium or purchase discount to interest income resulting solely from merger-related accounting adjustments in connection with the assets acquired in the OCSI Merger and the OSI2 Merger, in each case, including any premium or discount paid for the acquisition of such assets, solely to the extent that the inclusion of such merger-related accounting adjustments, in the aggregate, would result in an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the calculation of the incentive fee on income for each quarter is as follows: 
 
 No incentive fee is payable to Oaktree in any quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.50 (the preferred return on net assets. 
 100 of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 1.8182 in any fiscal quarter is payable to Oaktree. We refer to this portion of the incentive fee on income as the catch-up provision, and it is intended to provide Oaktree with an incentive fee of 17.5 on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income when our pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches 1.8182 on net assets in any fiscal quarter. 
 For any quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 1.8182 on net assets, the incentive fee on income is equal to 17.5 of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, as the preferred return and catch-up will have been achieved. 
 There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. 
 The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the incentive fee on income under the Investment Advisory Agreement: 
 
 Quarterly Incentive Fee on Income 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 (expressed as a percentage of net assets) 

Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income allocated to income-related portion of incentive fee 
 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) commencing with the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and equals 17.5 of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 through the end of each subsequent fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Any realized capital gains, realized capital losses, unrealized capital appreciation and unrealized capital depreciation with respect to our portfolio as of the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 are excluded from the calculations of the second part of the incentive fee. In addition, the calculation of realized capital gains, realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation does (1) not include any such amounts resulting solely from merger-related accounting adjustments in connection with the assets acquired in the OCSI Merger, including any premium or discount paid for the acquisition of such assets, solely to the extent that the inclusion of such merger-related accounting adjustments, in the aggregate, would result in an increase in the capital gains incentive fee, (2) include any such amounts associated with the investments acquired in the OCSI Merger for the period from October 1, 2018 to the date of 
 11 

closing of the OCSI Merger, solely to the extent that the exclusion of such amounts, in the aggregate, would result in an increase in the capital gains incentive fee and (3) include any such amounts associated with the investments acquired in the OSI2 Merger for the period from August 6, 2018 to the date of closing of the OSI2 Merger, solely to the extent that the exclusion of such amounts, in the aggregate, would result in an increase in the capital gains incentive fee. 
 Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation under the Investment Advisory Agreement (A) 
 Example 1: Incentive Fee on Income for Each Quarter 
 Alternative 1 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.80 
 Preferred return under the Investment Advisory Agreement 1 = 1.50 
 Management fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement 2 = 0.25 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 (investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 1.35 
 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return under the Investment Advisory Agreement, therefore there is no incentive fee on income under the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 
 Alternative 2 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.25 
 Preferred return under the Investment Advisory Agreement 1 = 1.50 
 Management fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement 2 = 0.25 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 (investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 1.80 
 Incentive fee = 17.5 pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to catch-up 3 
 = 100 (1.80 - 1.50 
 = 0.30 
 
 Alternative 3 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.375 
 Preferred return under the Investment Advisory Agreement 1 = 1.50 
 Management fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement 2 = 0.25 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 (investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.925 
 Incentive fee = 17.5 pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to catch-up 3 
 Incentive fee = 100 catch-up + (17.5 (pre-incentive fee net investment income - 1.8182 )) 
 Catch-up = 1.8182 - 1.50 = 0.3182 
 Incentive fee = (100 0.3182 + (17.5 (2.925 - 1.8182 )) 
 = 0.3182 + (17.5 1.1068 
 = 0.3182 + 0.1937 
 = 0.5119 
 __________ 
 (A) Solely for purposes of these illustrative examples, we have assumed that we have not incurred any leverage. However, we have in the past and expect to continue in the future to use leverage to partially finance our investments. 
 
 1. Represents 6.0 annualized preferred return. 
 2. Represents 1.00 annualized management fee and does not reflect any waivers of the management fee. 
 12 

3. The catch-up provision is intended to provide our Adviser with an incentive fee of 17.5 on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a preferred return did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 1.50 in any calendar quarter and is not applied once our Adviser has received 17.5 of investment income in a quarter. The catch-up portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income is the portion that exceeds the 1.50 preferred return but is less than or equal to approximately 1.8182 (that is, 1.50 divided by (1 - 0.175)) in any fiscal quarter. 
 
 Example 2: Incentive Fee on Capital Gains under the Investment Advisory Agreement 
 Assumptions 
 Year 1: 10 million investment made in Company A Investment A ), 10 million investment made in Company B Investment B ), 10 million investment made in Company C Investment C ), 10 million investment made in Company D Investment D and 10 million investment made in Company E Investment E ). 
 Year 2: Investment A sold for 20 million, fair market value FMV of Investment B determined to be 8 million, FMV of Investment C determined to be 12 million, and FMV of Investments D and E each determined to be 10 million. 
 Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be 8 million, FMV of Investment C determined to be 14 million, FMV of Investment D determined to be 14 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be 16 million. 
 Year 4: Investment D sold for 12 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be 10 million, FMV of Investment C determined to be 16 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be 14 million. 
 Year 5: Investment C sold for 20 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be 14 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be 10 million. 
 Year 6: Investment B sold for 16 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be 8 million. 
 Year 7: Investment E sold for 8 million and FMV. 

These assumptions are summarized in the following chart: 
 Investment A Investment B Investment C Investment D Investment E Cumulative Unrealized Capital Depreciation Cumulative Realized Capital Losses Cumulative Realized Capital Gains Year 1 10 million (cost basis) 10 million (cost basis) 10 million (cost basis) 10 million (cost basis) 10 million (cost basis) -- -- -- Year 2 20 million (sale price) 8 million FMV 12 million FMV 10 million FMV 10 million FMV 2 million -- 10 million Year 3 -- 8 million FMV 14 million FMV 14 million FMV 16 million FMV 2 million -- 10 million Year 4 -- 10 million FMV 16 million FMV 12 million (sale price) 14 million FMV -- -- 12 million Year 5 -- 14 million FMV 20 million (sale price) -- 10 million FMV -- -- 22 million Year 6 -- 16 million (sale price) -- -- 8 million FMV 2 million -- 28 million Year 7 -- -- -- -- 8 million (sale price) -- 2 million 28 million 

The Incentive Fee on Capital Gains under the Investment Advisory Agreement would be: 
 Year 1: None 
 
 Year 2: Capital Gains Fee = 17.5 multiplied by 10 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A less 2 million cumulative capital depreciation) = 1.4 million 
 
 Year 3: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5 multiplied by 10 million cumulative realized capital gains less 2 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less 1.4 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = 1.4 million less 1.4 million = 0.00 million 
 
 Year 4: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5 multiplied by 12 million cumulative realized capital gains)) less 1.4 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = 2.1 million less 1.4 million = 0.7 million 
 
 Year 5: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5 multiplied by 22 million cumulative realized capital gains)) less 2.1 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = 3.85 million less 2.1 million = 1.75 million 
 
 13 

Year 6: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5 multiplied by 28 million cumulative realized capital gains less 2 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less 3.85 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = 4.55 million less 3.85 million = 0.70 million 
 
 Year 7: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5 multiplied by 28 million cumulative realized capital gains less 2 million cumulative realized capital losses)) less 4.55 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = 4.55 million less 4.55 million = 0.00 million 
 Duration and Termination 
 Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect from year-to-year if approved annually by our Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other. The Investment Advisory Agreement may also be terminated, without penalty, upon the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 Indemnification 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, Oaktree and its officers, managers, partners, members (and their members, including the owners of their members), agents, employees, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Oaktree s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. 
 Organization of our Adviser 
 Our Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The principal address of our Adviser is 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071. 
 Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement 
 At the meeting held on November 7, 2024, our Board of Directors, including all of the independent directors, unanimously approved the Investment Advisory Agreement. In reaching its decision to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors, including all of the independent directors, reviewed a significant amount of information, which had been furnished by Oaktree at the request of independent counsel, on behalf of the independent directors. In reaching a decision to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors considered, among other things: 
 
 the nature, extent and quality of services performed by Oaktree; 
 the investment performance of us and other Business Development Companies with a similar investment objective to us; 
 the costs of services provided and the profits realized by Oaktree and its affiliates from their relationship with us; 
 the possible economies of scale that would be realized due to our growth; 
 whether fee levels reflect such economies of scale for the benefit of investors; and 
 comparisons of services rendered to and fees paid by us with the services provided by and the fees paid to other investment advisers and the services provided to and the fees paid by other Oaktree clients. 
 No single factor was determinative of the decision of our Board of Directors, including all of the independent directors, to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement and individual directors may have weighed certain factors differently. Throughout the process, the independent directors were advised by, and met separately with, independent counsel.

 Oaktree Administrator also provides portfolio collection functions for interest income, fees and warrants and is responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain, and prepares, prints and disseminates reports to our stockholders and all other materials filed with the SEC. In addition, Oaktree Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Oaktree Administrator may also offer to provide, on our behalf, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. 
 For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we reimburse Oaktree Administrator the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Oaktree Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the rent of our principal executive offices (which are located in a building owned by a Brookfield affiliate) at market rates and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our 
 15 

Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, their staffs and other non-investment professionals at Oaktree that perform duties for us. Such reimbursement is at cost, with no profit to, or markup by, Oaktree Administrator. 
 The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, Oaktree Administrator and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members (or their owners) and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Oaktree Administrator s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator. 
 Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect from year-to-year if approved annually by our Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other. The Administration Agreement may also be terminated, without penalty, upon the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. We compete for investments with various other investors, such as other public and private funds, other Business Development Companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies and to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds, some of which may be our affiliates. Other Oaktree funds may have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may result in us receiving no or limited allocations. Many competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that will not be available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we do, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act and the Code impose on us. The competitive pressures could impair our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure We may face increasing competition for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses." 
 Staffing 
 We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided through the Administration Agreement and the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interest 
 Our executive officers and directors, and certain members of our Adviser, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. For example, Oaktree presently serves as the investment adviser to Oaktree Gardens OLP, LLC, or OLPG, a private Business Development Company, and Oaktree Strategic Credit Fund, or OSCF, a continuously offered Business Development Company. All of our executive officers serve in substantially similar capacities for OLPG and OSCF, and one of our independent directors serves as an independent director of OSCF. OLPG and OSCF invest in senior secured loans, including first lien, unitranche and second lien debt instruments that pay interest at rates which are determined periodically on the basis of a floating base lending rate, made to private middle-market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, similar to those we target for investment. Oaktree and its affiliates also manage or sub-advise other Business Development Companies, registered investment companies and private investment funds and accounts, and may manage other such funds and accounts in the future, which have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. Therefore, there may be certain investment opportunities that satisfy the investment criteria for OLPG, OSCF and us as well as other Business Development Companies, registered investment companies and private investment funds and accounts advised or sub-advised by Oaktree or its affiliates. In addition, Oaktree and its affiliates may have obligations to investors in other entities that they advise or sub-advise, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. 
 For example, the personnel of our Adviser may face conflicts of interest in the allocation of investment opportunities to us and such other funds and accounts. Oaktree has investment allocation guidelines that govern the allocation of investment opportunities among the investment funds and accounts managed or sub-advised by Oaktree and its affiliates. To the extent an investment opportunity is appropriate for OLPG, OSCF or us or any other investment fund or account managed or sub-advised 
 16 

by Oaktree or its affiliates, Oaktree will adhere to its investment allocation guidelines in order to determine a fair and equitable allocation. 
 We may invest alongside funds and accounts managed or sub-advised by our Adviser and its affiliates in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. For example, we may invest alongside such accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the staff of the SEC permitting us and such other accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that our Adviser, acting on our behalf and on behalf of other clients, negotiates no term other than price or terms related to price. 
 In addition, affiliates of our Adviser have received exemptive relief from the SEC to allow certain managed funds and accounts, each of whose investment adviser is OCM or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with OCM, such as our Adviser, as well as proprietary accounts (subject to certain conditions) to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions where doing so is consistent with the applicable registered fund s or Business Development Company s investment objective and strategies as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to the conditions of the exemptive relief. On September 11, 2024, we, the Adviser and certain of its affiliates received a further modified exemptive order that allows us to participate in follow-on investments with private funds that are not already invested in the issuer. Each potential co-investment opportunity that falls under the terms of the exemptive relief and is appropriate for us and any affiliated fund or account, and satisfies the then-current board-established criteria, will be offered to us and such other eligible funds and accounts. If there is a sufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated among the participants in accordance with their proposed order size and if there is an insufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated pro rata based on the investment proposed by the applicable investment adviser to such participant, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each, which is reviewed and approved by an independent committee of legal, compliance and accounting professionals at our Adviser. We may also invest alongside funds managed by our Adviser and its affiliates in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. For example, we may invest alongside such accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the staff of the SEC permitting us and such other accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that our Adviser, acting on our behalf and on behalf of other clients, negotiates no term other than price. 
 Although Oaktree will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, we and our common stockholders could be adversely affected to the extent investment opportunities are allocated among us and other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, our executive officers, directors and members of our Adviser. We might not participate in each individual opportunity, but will, on an overall basis, be entitled to participate equitably with other entities managed by Oaktree and its affiliates. Oaktree is committed to treating all clients fairly and equitably over time such that none receive preferential treatment vis- -vis the others over time, in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duty to each of them; however, in some instances, especially in instances of limited liquidity, the factors may not result in pro rata allocations or may result in situations where certain funds or accounts receive allocations where others do not. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser s liability is limited and we are required to indemnify our Adviser against certain liabilities. This may lead our Adviser to act in a riskier manner in performing its duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement than it would if it were acting for its own account, and creates a potential conflict of interest. 
 Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, Oaktree Administrator furnishes us with the facilities, including our principal executive office, and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We pay Oaktree Administrator its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Oaktree Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including, without limitation, a portion of the rent at market rates and compensation of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, their respective staffs and other non-investment professionals at Oaktree that perform duties for us. 
 Election to be Taxed as a Regulated Investment Company 
 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to operate in a manner so as to continuously qualify annually, as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be required to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to our stockholders as dividends. Instead, dividends we distribute (or are deemed to distributed) generally will be taxable to stockholders, and any net operating losses, foreign tax credits and most other tax attributes generally will not pass through to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal corporate-level income tax on any undistributed income and gains. To continue 
 17 

to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute (or be deemed to distribute) to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90 of the Company s investment company taxable income for that year, which is generally its ordinary income plus the excess of its realized net short-term capital gains over its realized net long-term capital losses (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction), or the Annual Distribution Requirement. Our qualification and taxation as a RIC depends upon our ability to satisfy on a continuing basis, through actual, annual operating results, distribution, income and asset, and other requirements imposed under the Code. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to meet the complex and varied tests required to qualify as a RIC or to avoid corporate level tax. In addition, because the relevant laws may change, compliance with one or more of the RIC requirements may be impossible or impracticable. 
 If we: 
 qualify as a RIC; and 
 satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement; 
 
 then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular U.S. corporate income tax rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 
 We will be subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, less certain reductions, as applicable, and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax, in preceding years. 
 In order to maintain our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 
 at all times during each taxable year, have in effect an election to be treated as a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act; 
 
 derive in each taxable year at least 90 of our gross income from (a) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities (including loans), gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain "qualified publicly traded partnerships," or other income (including certain deemed inclusions) derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or foreign currencies and (b) net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership; (the 90 Gross Income Test and 
 
 diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 
 
 (i) at least 50 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5 of the value of its assets or more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 
 
 (ii) no more than 25 of the value of our assets is invested in a the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, b the securities of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or c the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (i) and (ii) collectively, the Diversification Tests ). 
 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with increasing interest rates or debt instruments issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any OID accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 
 Because we use debt financing, we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the Investment Company Act described above and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain 
 18 

circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources or are otherwise limited in our ability to make distributions, we could fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to U.S. corporate-level income tax. 
 Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things: (a) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions; (b) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income; (c) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited); (d) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash; (e) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of securities is deemed to occur; (f) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions; or (g) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90 Gross Income Test described above. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions. 
 If, in any particular taxable year, we do not qualify as a RIC, all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) will be subject to tax at regular U.S. corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to stockholders, and distributions will be taxable to the stockholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. 
 Business Development Company Regulations 
 We have elected to be a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act. As with other companies regulated by the Investment Company Act, a Business Development Company must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. The Investment Company Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between Business Development Companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. 
 The Investment Company Act further requires that a majority of our directors be persons other than interested persons, as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a Business Development Company unless authorized by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the Investment Company Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the Investment Company Act as the lesser of: (a) 67 or more of such company s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50 of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50 of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 
 We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). We may also make rights offerings to our stockholders at prices per share less than the net asset value per share, subject to applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act. 
 Investment Restrictions 
 We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the Investment Company Act. Under such limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3 of the voting stock of any registered investment company (which may be increased to 25 in certain circumstances under certain fund of funds arrangements), invest more than 5 of the value of our total assets in the securities of one registered investment company or invest more than 10 of the value of our total assets in the securities of registered investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject stockholders to additional indirect expenses. None of the policies described above is fundamental and each such policy may be changed without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the Investment Company Act. 
 Qualifying Assets 
 Under the Investment Company Act, a Business Development Company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70 of the company s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following: 
 19 

(1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the Investment Company Act as any issuer which: 
 (a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
 (b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the Business Development Company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the Investment Company Act; and 
 (c) satisfies any of the following: 
 (i) does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange; 
 (ii) has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than 250 million; 
 (iii) is controlled by a Business Development Company or a group of companies including a Business Development Company and the Business Development Company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or 
 (iv) is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than 4 million and capital and surplus of not less than 2 million; 
 (2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control; 
 (3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements; 
 (4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60 of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company; 
 (5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities; or 
 (6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 A Business Development Company must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70 test, a Business Development Company must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance. However, when a Business Development Company purchases securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance includes any arrangement whereby a Business Development Company, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 
 Temporary Investments 
 Pending investment in other types of "qualifying assets," as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment (collectively, temporary investments so that 70 of our assets are qualifying assets. We may also invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as the Company, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25 of our gross assets 
 20 

constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
 Senior Securities 
 At a special meeting of stockholders held on June 28, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act to us, effective as of June 29, 2019. The reduced asset coverage requirements permit us to double the maximum amount of leverage that we are permitted to incur by reducing the asset coverage requirements applicable to us from 200 to 150 . As a result of the reduced asset coverage requirement, we can incur 2 of debt for each 1 of equity. 
 Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as calculated as provided in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150 immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we may make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We would also be permitted to borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of our total assets for generally up to 60 days for temporary purposes without regard to asset coverage. 
 Other 
 We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the Investment Company Act. 
 We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a Business Development Company, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person s office. 
 We and our Adviser are each required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the U.S. federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
 Code of Ethics 
 We have adopted a joint code of ethics with OLPG and OSCF pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and we have also approved Oaktree s code of ethics that was adopted by it under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act. These codes establish procedures for personal investments and restrict certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the codes may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the applicable code s requirements. The codes of ethics are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov and our code of ethics is available at the Investors: Corporate Governance portion of our website at www.oaktreespecialtylending.com. 
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures of our Adviser are set forth below. These guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Adviser and our independent directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
 An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, our Adviser recognizes that it must vote portfolio securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. 
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 Our Adviser will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities, if any, in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Our Adviser will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a shareholder vote to determine its 
 21 

impact on portfolio securities held by us. Although our Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there are compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 Our Adviser s proxy voting decisions will be made by officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that the vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Adviser will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to the Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Adviser intends to vote on a proposal, in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 
 Stockholders may obtain information regarding how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation, Chief Compliance Officer, 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071. 
 Reporting Obligations 
 We file annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. 
 We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC in accordance with the Exchange Act. These include our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov . 
 We maintain a website at www.oaktreespecialtylending.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance 
 We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on public companies and their insiders. For example: 
 
 pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
 pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; and 
 pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit our internal control over financial reporting. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
 
 Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Regulations 
 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We are in compliance with such corporate governance regulations as applicable to us.

(exclusive of deferred financing costs and inclusive of the impact of an interest rate swap designated as a hedging instrument). We will need to generate sufficient cash flow to make these required interest payments. In order for us to cover our annual interest payments on indebtedness, we must achieve annual returns on our September 30, 2024 total assets of at least . If we are unable to meet the financial obligations under our credit facilities, the lenders under such credit facilities will have a superior claim to our assets over our stockholders. If we are unable to meet the financial obligations under the 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes or 2029 Notes, the holders thereof will have the right to declare the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on such notes to be due and payable immediately.

Illustration. 
 
 - - 
 
 For purposes of this table, we have assumed 3,130.3 million in total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities), 1,660.0 million in debt outstanding, 1,487.8 million in net assets as of September 30, 2024, and a weighted average interest rate of as of September 30, 2024 (exclusive of deferred financing costs and inclusive of the impact of an interest rate swap designated as a hedging instrument). Actual interest payments may be different. 
 
 Substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests under our credit facilities and if we default on our obligations under any such facility, we may suffer adverse consequences, including foreclosure on our assets. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, substantially all of our assets were pledged as collateral under our credit facilities and may be pledged as collateral under future credit facilities. If we default on our obligations under these facilities, the lenders may have the right to foreclose upon and sell, or otherwise transfer, the collateral subject to their security interests or their superior claim. In such event, we may be forced to sell our investments to raise funds to repay our outstanding borrowings in order to avoid foreclosure and these forced sales may be at times and at prices we would not consider advantageous. Moreover, such deleveraging of our company could significantly impair our ability to effectively operate our business in the manner in which we have historically operated. As a result, we could be forced to curtail or cease new investment activities and lower or eliminate the distributions that we have historically paid to our stockholders. 
 
 In addition, if the lenders exercise their right to sell the assets pledged under our credit facilities or future credit facilities, such sales may be completed at distressed sale prices, thereby diminishing or potentially eliminating the amount of cash available to us after repayment of the amounts outstanding under the credit facilities. 
 
 We may enter into reverse repurchase agreements, which are another form of leverage. 
 
 We may enter into reverse repurchase agreements as part of our management of our temporary investment portfolio. Our entry into any such reverse repurchase agreements would be subject to the Investment Company Act limitations on leverage. In connection with entry into a reverse repurchase agreement, we would effectively pledge our assets as collateral to secure a short-term loan. Generally, the other party to the agreement would make a loan to us in an amount equal to a percentage of the fair value of the collateral we have pledged. At the maturity of the reverse repurchase agreement, we will be required to repay the loan and then receive back our collateral. While used as collateral, the assets continue to pay principal and interest which are for the benefit of us. 
 
 Our use of reverse repurchase agreements, if any, involves many of the same risks involved in our use of leverage. For example, the market value of the securities acquired in the reverse repurchase agreement may decline below the price of the securities that we have sold but we would remain obligated to purchase those securities, meaning that we bear the risk of loss that the proceeds at settlement are less than the fair value of the securities pledged. In addition, the market value of the securities retained by us may decline. If a buyer of securities under a reverse repurchase agreement were to file for bankruptcy or experience insolvency, we would be adversely affected. In addition, due to the interest costs associated with reverse repurchase agreements, our net asset value would decline, and, in some cases, we may be worse off than if we had not used such agreements.

 Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 We rely on the cybersecurity strategy and policies implemented by Oaktree. Oaktree maintains a cyber risk management program designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats. This program is integrated into Oaktree s overall risk management processes and focuses on the corporate information technology environment. The audit committee of the board of directors of Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC oversees Oaktree s cybersecurity program. The cybersecurity team briefs the audit committee of Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC on the effectiveness of Oaktree s cyber risk management program. The Internal Audit team also shares the results of its annual cybersecurity audits with the audit committee of Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC. 
 The underlying controls of the cyber risk management program are designed to meet Oaktree s business requirements, security risks and organization profile, and leverages many elements of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework and the International Organization Standardization 27001 Information Security Management System Requirements. The Internal Audit team conducts an annual internal audit of the Company s cyber risk management program utilizing the services of a third-party provider. Additionally, Oaktree hires a third party provider to conduct an annual penetration test of Oaktree's systems. Oaktree has developed and implemented controls and processes to oversee and manage its engagements with third-party vendors. These procedures encompass pre-engagement due diligence efforts and the ongoing monitoring of the third-party vendors that are considered to be high-risk. Although these controls and processes are designed to mitigate risks associated with third-party engagements, they do not guarantee the elimination of all potential risks. The effectiveness of these controls and processes is dependent on a variety of factors, some of which are outside Oaktree s and our control. 
 A third party Managed Security Service Provider manages Oaktree s Security Operations Center to provide 24/7 monitoring of its global systems and to coordinate the investigation of alerts of potential security incidents. Alerts are then escalated to the Oaktree Cybersecurity team for investigation and remediation, if necessary. Cyber partners are a key part of Oaktree s cybersecurity infrastructure. Oaktree partners with leading cybersecurity companies and organizations, leveraging third-party technology and expertise. Oaktree engages with these partners to monitor and maintain the performance and effectiveness of products and services that are deployed in Oaktree s environment. A Managing Director in Oaktree s information technology department heads Oaktree s cybersecurity team. This individual reports to Oaktree s Chief Information Officer. and is responsible for assessing and managing Oaktree s cyber risk management program, informs senior management regarding the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents and supervises such efforts. The cybersecurity team has decades of collective experience selecting, deploying and operating cybersecurity technologies, initiatives and processes and relies on threat intelligence as well as other information obtained from governmental, public and private sources, including external consultants engaged by Oaktree. 
 The head of Oaktree s cybersecurity team has substantial information technology and cybersecurity experience, with a career spanning over 30 years in managing global IT operations in a wide range of areas, including cybersecurity, IT governance, controls, compliance, data center operations, network engineering and cloud computing. 
 Our board of directors oversees our cybersecurity program and receives quarterly updates from the cybersecurity team on matters including Oaktree s cyber risk management program (and risks to us related to cybersecurity) and updates to the cybersecurity program, including active and recently completed initiatives. 
 We and Oaktree face risks from cybersecurity threats that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We and Oaktree have experienced, and will continue to experience, cyber incidents in the normal course of its business. However, we are not currently aware of any current or past cyberattacks or other incidents that, individually or in the aggregate, have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure We may face a breach of our cyber security, which could result in adverse consequences to our operations and exposure of confidential information . 

Item 2. Properties 
 We do not own any real estate or other physical properties material to our operations. Our administrative and principal executive offices are located at 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071. We believe that our office facilities are suitable and adequate for our business as it is presently conducted.

 (6) The incentive fee consists of two parts. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee on income is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter. The payment of the incentive fee on income is subject to payment of a preferred return to investors each quarter (i.e., a hurdle rate ), expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the most recently completed quarter, of 1.50 , subject to a catch up feature. In addition, pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any amortization or accretion of any purchase premium or purchase discount to interest income resulting solely from merger-related accounting adjustments in connection with the assets acquired in the OCSI Merger or in the OSI2 Merger, in each case, including any premium or discount paid for the acquisition of such assets, solely to the extent that the inclusion of such merger-related accounting adjustments, in the aggregate, would result in an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income. See Item 1. Business - Investment Advisory Agreement - Management and Incentive Fee for additional information. 
 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the second part of the incentive fee (the capital gains incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) commencing with the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and equals 17.5 of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 through the end of each fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Any realized capital gains or losses and unrealized capital depreciation with respect to our portfolio as of the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 are excluded from the calculations of the second part of the

(exclusive of deferred financing costs and inclusive of the impact of an interest rate swap designated as a hedging instrument). The amount of leverage that we employ at any particular time will depend on, among other things, our Board of Directors assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.

 (10) Total annual expenses is presented as a percentage of net assets attributable to common stockholders because our common stockholders bear all of our fees and expenses and includes all fees and expenses of our consolidated subsidiaries. Total annual expenses does not reflect any potential provision (benefit) for income taxes because of the uncertainties associated with determining such amounts in future periods.

 The example and the expenses in the tables above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses, and actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown. While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5 annual return, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5 . The incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income under the Investment Advisory Agreement, which, assuming a 5 annual return, would either not be payable or would have an insignificant impact on the expense amounts shown above, is not included in the

Business Environment and Developments 
 
 Global financial markets have experienced an increase in volatility over the last few years amid higher inflation, elevated interest rates, and concern over a potential slowdown in economic activity. As inflation pressures have eased in recent months, the Federal Reserve has relaxed its monetary policies and cut the federal funds rate to support the broader economy. However, various macroeconomic headwinds remain including ongoing conflict in the Middle East and signs of an economic slowdown outside the United States. These uncertainties can ultimately impact the overall supply and demand of the market through changing spreads, deal terms and structures and equity purchase price multiples. 
 
 We are unable to predict the full effects of these macroeconomic events or how they might evolve. We continue to closely monitor the impact these events have on our business, industry and portfolio companies and will provide constructive solutions where necessary. 
 
 Against this backdrop, we believe attractive risk-adjusted returns can be achieved by making loans to companies in the middle market. Given the breadth of the investment platform and decades of credit investing experience of Oaktree and its affiliates, we believe that we have the resources and experience to source, diligence and structure investments in these companies. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 Oaktree, as the valuation designee of our Board of Directors pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, determines the fair value of our assets on at least a quarterly basis in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A liability s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments complexity. 
 Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows: 
 
 Level 1 Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. 
 Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
 Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect Oaktree s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. 
 If inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, an investment's level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Oaktree's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. This includes investment securities that are valued using "bid" and "ask" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments may be classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions. 
 Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, Oaktree obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers for all of our investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing vendors and brokers use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations. 
 Oaktree seeks to obtain at least two quotations for the subject or similar securities, typically from pricing vendors. If Oaktree is unable to obtain two quotes from pricing vendors, or if the prices obtained from pricing vendors are not within our set threshold, Oaktree seeks to obtain a quote directly from a broker making a market for the asset. Oaktree evaluates the quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers based on available market information, including trading activity of the 
 65 

subject or similar securities, or by performing a comparable security analysis to ensure that fair values are reasonably estimated. Oaktree also performs back-testing of valuation information obtained from pricing vendors and brokers against actual prices received in transactions. In addition to ongoing monitoring and back-testing, Oaktree performs due diligence procedures over pricing vendors to understand their methodology and controls to support their use in the valuation process. Generally, Oaktree does not adjust any of the prices received from these sources. 
 If the quotations obtained from pricing vendors or brokers are determined to not be reliable or are not readily available, Oaktree values such investments using any of three different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is the transaction precedent technique, which utilizes recent or expected future transactions of the investment to determine fair value, to the extent applicable. The second valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value, or EV, of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The EV analysis is typically performed to determine (i) the value of equity investments, (ii) whether there is credit impairment for debt investments and (iii) the value for debt investments that we are deemed to control under the Investment Company Act. To estimate the EV of a portfolio company, Oaktree analyzes various factors, including the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results, macroeconomic impacts on the company and competitive dynamics in the company s industry. Oaktree also utilizes some or all of the following information based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company: (i) valuations of comparable public companies, (ii) recent sales of private and public comparable companies in similar industries or having similar business or earnings characteristics, (iii) purchase prices as a multiple of their earnings or cash flow, (iv) the portfolio company s ability to meet its forecasts and its business prospects, (v) a discounted cash flow analysis, (vi) estimated liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company s assets and (vii) offers from third parties to buy the portfolio company. Oaktree may probability weight potential sale outcomes with respect to a portfolio company when uncertainty exists as of the valuation date. Under the EV technique, the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our investments in debt or equity securities is the EBITDA, revenue or asset multiple, as applicable. Increases or decreases in the valuation multiples in isolation may result in a higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively. The third valuation technique is a market yield technique, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. In the market yield technique, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk, and we consider the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, Oaktree depends on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry-specific market movements, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable. Under the market yield technique, the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our investments in debt securities is the market yield. Increases or decreases in the market yield may result in a lower or higher fair value measurement, respectively. 
 In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with ASC 946 may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value. Consistent with FASB guidance under ASC 820, these investments are excluded from the hierarchical levels. These investments are generally not redeemable. 
 Oaktree estimates the fair value of certain privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions, including the current stock price (by using an EV analysis as described above), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk-free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates. 
 The fair value of our investments as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was determined by Oaktree, as our valuation designee. We have and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance each quarter regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. As of September 30, 2024, 94.5 of our portfolio at fair value was valued either based on market quotations, the transactions precedent approach or corroborated by independent valuation firms. 
 Certain factors that may be considered in determining the fair value of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s earnings and its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, Oaktree's determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Due to these uncertainties, Oaktree's fair value determinations may cause our net asset value on a given date to materially understate or overstate the value that we may ultimately realize upon the sale of one or more of our investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 3,021.3 million of investments at fair value, up from 2,892.4 million held at September 30, 2023, primarily driven by purchases of investments during the year ended September 30, 2024. As of 
 66 

September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, approximately 94.5 and 89.9 , respectively, of our total assets represented investments at fair value. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest income. The principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income, adjusted for accretion of OID is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest cash payments will be collected. Cash interest payments received on investments may be recognized as income or a return of capital depending upon management s judgment. A non-accrual investment is restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash, and the portfolio company, in management s judgment, is likely to continue timely payment of its remaining obligations. As of September 30, 2024, there were nine investments on non-accrual status that in the aggregate represented 4.9 and 4.0 of total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, there were four investments on non-accrual status that in aggregate represented 2.4 and 1.8 of total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. 
 In connection with our investment in a portfolio company, we sometimes receive nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the portfolio company. When we receive nominal cost equity, we allocate our cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. 
 PIK Interest Income 
 Our investments in debt securities may contain PIK interest provisions. PIK interest, which typically represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We generally cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. Our decision to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; our assessment of the portfolio company's business development success; information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. Our determination to cease accruing PIK interest is generally made well before our full write-down of a loan or debt security. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of the loans or debt securities would be reduced by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost bases of these investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements including for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to Oaktree. To maintain our status as a RIC, certain income from PIK interest may be required to be distributed to our stockholders, even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never do so. 
 Portfolio Composition 
 Our investments principally consist of loans, common and preferred equity and warrants in privately-held companies, SLF JV I, a joint venture through which we and Kemper co-invest in senior secured loans of middle-market companies and other corporate debt securities, and Glick JV, a joint venture through which we and GF Equity Funding co-invest primarily in senior secured loans of middle-market companies. We refer to SLF JV I and the Glick JV collectively as the JVs. Our loans are typically secured by a first, second or subordinated lien on the assets of the portfolio company and generally have terms of up to ten years (but an expected average life of between three and four years). 
 During the year ended September 30, 2024, we originated 1,363.6 million of investment commitments in 54 new and 44 existing portfolio companies and funded 1,270.9 million of investments. 
 67 

During the year ended September 30, 2024, we received 1,060.0 million of proceeds from prepayments, exits, other paydowns and sales and exited 51 portfolio companies.

 The Joint Ventures 
 
 Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC 
 
 In May 2014, we entered into a limited liability company, or LLC, agreement with Kemper to form SLF JV I. We co-invest in senior secured loans of middle-market companies and other corporate debt securities with Kemper through our investment in SLF JV I. SLF JV I is managed by a four person Board of Directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by Kemper. All portfolio decisions and investment decisions in respect of SLF JV I must be approved by the SLF JV I investment committee, which consists of one representative selected by us and one representative selected by Kemper (with approval from a representative of each required). Since we do not have a controlling financial interest in SLF JV I, we do not consolidate SLF JV I. SLF JV I is not an "eligible portfolio company" as defined in section 2(a)(46) of the Investment Company Act. SLF JV I is capitalized pro rata with LLC equity interests as transactions are completed and may be capitalized with additional subordinated notes issued to us and Kemper by SLF JV I. The subordinated notes issued by SLF JV I are referred to as the SLF JV I Notes. The SLF JV I Notes are senior in right of payment to SLF JV I LLC equity interests and subordinated in right of payment to SLF JV I s secured debt. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we and Kemper owned, in the aggregate, 87.5 and 12.5 , respectively, of the LLC equity interests of SLF JV I and the outstanding SLF JV I Notes. As of each of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we and Kemper had funded approximately 190.5 million to SLF JV I, of which 166.7 million was from us. As of each of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had aggregate commitments to fund SLF JV I of 13.1 million, of which approximately 9.8 million was to fund additional SLF JV I Notes and approximately 3.3 million was to fund LLC equity interests in SLF JV I. 
 Both the cost and fair value of our SLF JV I Notes were 112.7 million as of each of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. We earned interest income of 14.3 million, 12.7 million and 8.0 million on the SLF JV I Notes for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the SLF JV I Notes bore interest at a rate of one-month SOFR plus 7.00 per annum with a SOFR floor of 1.00 and will mature on December 29, 2028. 
 The cost and fair value of the LLC equity interests in SLF JV I held by us was 54.8 million and 22.5 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and 54.8 million and 28.9 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. We earned 5.3 million, 4.2 million and 2.9 million in dividend income for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, with respect to our investment in the LLC equity interests of SLF JV I. 
 Below is a summary of SLF JV I's portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

 OCSI Glick JV LLC 
 On March 19, 2021, we became party to the LLC agreement of the Glick JV. The Glick JV invests primarily in senior secured loans of middle-market companies. We co-invest in these securities with GF Equity Funding through the Glick JV. The Glick JV is managed by a four person Board of Directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by GF Equity Funding. All portfolio decisions and investment decisions in respect of the Glick JV must be approved by the Glick JV investment committee, consisting of one representative selected by us and one representative selected by GF Equity Funding (with approval from a representative of each required). Since we do not have a controlling financial interest in the Glick JV, we do not consolidate the Glick JV. The Glick JV is not an "eligible portfolio company" as defined in section 2(a)(46) of the Investment Company Act. The Glick JV is capitalized as transactions are completed. The members provide capital to the Glick 
 71 

JV in exchange for LLC equity interests, and we and GF Debt Funding, an entity advised by affiliates of GF Equity Funding, provide capital to the Glick JV in exchange for subordinated notes issued by the Glick JV, or the Glick JV Notes. The Glick JV Notes are junior in right of payment to the repayment of temporary contributions made by us to fund investments of the Glick JV that are repaid when GF Equity Funding and GF Debt Funding make their capital contributions and fund their Glick JV Notes, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we and GF Equity Funding owned 87.5 and 12.5 , respectively, of the outstanding LLC equity interests, and we and GF Debt Funding owned 87.5 and 12.5 , respectively, of the Glick JV Notes. Approximately 84.0 million in aggregate commitments was funded as of each of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, of which 73.5 million was from us. As of each of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had commitments to fund Glick JV Notes of 78.8 million, of which 12.4 million was unfunded. As of each of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had commitments to fund LLC equity interests in the Glick JV of 8.7 million, of which 1.6 million was unfunded. 
 
 The cost and fair value of our aggregate investment in the Glick JV was 51.7 million and 48.9 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 . The cost and fair value of our aggregate investment in the Glick JV was 50.3 million and 50.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023 . For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our investment in the Glick JV Notes earned interest income of 7.2 million, 6.7 million and 4.7 million, respectively. We did not earn any dividend income for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 with respect to our investment in the LLC equity interests of the Glick JV. 
 Below is a summary of the Glick JV's portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

Discussion and Analysis of Results and Operations 
 Results of Operations 
 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations includes net investment income, net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends and fees and net expenses. Net realized gains (losses) is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of investment related assets and liabilities and their stated costs. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our investment related assets and liabilities carried at fair value during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation (depreciation) when gains or losses are realized. 
 Comparison of Years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Total Investment Income 
 Total investment income includes interest on our investments, fee income and dividend income. 
 Total investment income for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 381.7 million and 379.3 million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2024, this amount consisted of 367.1 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included 20.8 million of PIK interest), 9.2 million of fee income and 5.4 million of dividend income. For the year ended September 30, 2023, this amount consisted of 368.5 million of interest income from portfolio investments (which included 19.8 million of PIK interest), 6.5 million of fee income and 4.2 million of dividend income. The increase of 2.4 million, or 0.6 , in our total investment income for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to 2.7 million of higher fee income from increased prepayment and amendment fees and a 1.1 million increase in dividend income from our investment in SLF JV I. This was partially offset by a 1.4 million decrease in interest income, which resulted from lower OID accretion and an increase in the number of non-accrual investments. 
 Expenses 
 Net expenses (expenses net of fee waivers) for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 206.6 million and 198.5 million, respectively. Net expenses increased for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023, by 8.1 million, or 4.1 . The increase in net expenses was primarily driven by 17.0 million of higher interest expense due to the impact of rising interest rates on our floating rate liabilities. This was partially offset by a 5.5 million reduction in Part I incentive fees (net of waivers), 2.2 million of lower operating expenses and 1.2 million of lower management fees (net of waivers). 
 Net Investment Income 
 Net investment income for the year ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 5.6 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the 2.4 million increase in total investment income and the 8.1 million increase in net expenses. 
 Realized Gain (Loss) 
 Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of investments and foreign currency and the cost basis without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off during the period, net of recoveries. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules. 
 During the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded aggregate net realized losses of 136.4 million and 33.2 million, respectively, in connection with the exits and restructurings of various investments and foreign currency forward contracts. See Note 8. Realized Gains or Losses and Net Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding investment realization events for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation is the net change in the fair value of our investments and foreign currency during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. 
 73 

During the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of 19.1 million and (28.6) million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2024, this consisted of 69.8 million of net unrealized appreciation related to exited investments (a portion of which resulted in a reclassification to realized losses), partially offset by 37.5 million of net unrealized depreciation on equity investments, 8.8 million of net unrealized depreciation of foreign currency forward contracts and 4.4 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments. For the year ended September 30, 2023, this consisted of 49.1 million of net unrealized depreciation on debt investments and 4.9 million of net unrealized depreciation on equity investments, partially offset by 25.4 million of net unrealized appreciation related to exited investments (a portion of which resulted in a reclassification to realized losses) and 0.1 million of net unrealized appreciation of foreign currency forward contracts. 
 Comparison of Years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 
 The comparison of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 can be found within Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have a number of alternatives available to fund our investment portfolio and our operations, including raising equity, increasing or refinancing debt and funding from operational cash flow. We generally expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through additional debt and equity capital, which may include securitizing a portion of our investments. We cannot assure you, however, that our efforts to grow our portfolio will be successful. For example, our common stock has traded at prices below net asset value, and we may not be able to raise additional equity at prices below the then-current net asset value per share. We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, including interest earned, and future borrowings or equity offerings. We intend to fund our future distribution obligations through operating cash flow or with funds obtained through future equity and debt offerings or credit facilities, as we deem appropriate. 
 
 Our primary uses of cash are for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (2) the cost of operations (including our expenses, the management and incentive fees and any indemnification obligations), (3) debt service of borrowings and (4) cash distributions to stockholders. We may also from time to time repurchase or redeem some or all of our outstanding notes. At a special meeting of our stockholders held on June 28, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act to us effective as of June 29, 2019. As a result of the reduced asset coverage requirement, we can incur 2 of debt for each 1 of equity as compared to 1 of debt for each 1 of equity. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,663.8 million in senior securities and our asset coverage ratio was 188.14 . As of September 30, 2024, our target debt to equity ratio was 0.90x to 1.25x (i.e., one dollar of equity for each 0.90 to 1.25 of debt outstanding) and our net debt to equity ratio was 1.07x. 
 For the year ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of 67.0 million. During that period, net cash provided by operating activities was 19.1 million, primarily from 1,086.2 million of principal payments and sale proceeds received, the cash activities related to 175.1 million of net investment income, 42.6 million of net decreases in receivables and net increases in payables from unsettled transactions and a 37.2 million decrease in due from broker, partially offset by funding 1,281.4 million of investments. During the same period, net cash used in financing activities was 86.8 million, primarily consisting of 176.8 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders, partially offset by 92.7 million of proceeds from the issuance of shares under the "at the market" offering. 
 For the year ended September 30, 2023, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of 119.2 million. During that period, net cash provided by operating activities was 228.8 million, primarily from 912.0 million of principal payments and sale proceeds received, the cash activities related to 180.7 million of net investment income, 22.3 million of cash received in connection with the OSI2 Merger and a 16.3 million decrease in due from portfolio companies, partially offset by funding 742.1 million of investments and 65.2 million of net increases in receivables and net decreases in payables from unsettled transactions. During the same period, net cash used by financing activities was 110.4 million, primarily consisting of 215.0 million of net repayments under the credit facilities, 180.0 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders and 10.6 million of deferred financing costs paid, partially offset by 296.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes. 
 For the year ended September 30, 2022, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of 5.3 million. During that period, net cash provided by operating activities was 22.4 million, primarily from 693.7 million of principal payments and sale proceeds received, 22.4 million of net increase in payables from unsettled transactions and the cash activities related to 148.6 million of net investment income, partially offset by funding 702.1 million of investments, 43.9 million of increase in due from broker (cash held at a broker to cover collateral obligations under the interest

swap agreement) and 20.5 million increase in due from portfolio companies. During the same period, net cash used in financing activities was 26.8 million, primarily consisting of 115.2 million of cash distributions paid to our stockholders, 1.9 million of repurchases of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan, DRIP, and 0.3 million of deferred financing costs paid, partially offset by 70.0 million of net borrowings under the credit facilities and 20.6 million of proceeds (net of offering costs) from shares issued under the "at the market" offering. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 78.5 million in cash and cash equivalents (including 14.6 million of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of 3.0 billion, 38.8 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, 12.5 million of due from portfolio companies, 907.5 million of undrawn capacity on our credit facilities (subject to borrowing base and other limitations), 1.9 million of net receivables from unsettled transactions, 710.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities and 928.7 million of unsecured notes payable (net of unamortized financing costs, unaccreted discount and interest rate swap fair value adjustment). 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had 145.5 million in cash and cash equivalents (including 9.1 million of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of 2.9 billion, 44.6 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, 6.3 million of due from portfolio companies, 907.5 million of undrawn capacity on our credit facilities (subject to borrowing base and other limitations), 44.4 million of net receivables from unsettled transactions, 710.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities and 890.7 million of unsecured notes payable (net of unamortized financing costs, unaccreted discount and interest rate swap fair value adjustment). 
 We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2024, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of 311.4 million of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of 284.3 million to provide debt and equity financing to certain of our portfolio companies and 27.1 million to provide financing to the JVs. Of the 284.3 million, approximately 247.6 million can be drawn immediately with the remaining amount subject to certain milestones that must be met by portfolio companies or other restrictions. As of September 30, 2023, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of 232.7 million of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of 205.6 million to provide debt and equity financing to certain of our portfolio companies and 27.1 million to provide financing to the JVs. Of the 205.6 million, approximately 154.2 million can be drawn immediately with the remaining amount subject to certain milestones that must be met by portfolio companies or other restrictions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have analyzed cash and cash equivalents, availability under our credit facilities, the ability to rotate out of certain assets and amounts of unfunded commitments that could be drawn and believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to invest in market opportunities as they arise.

 (1) As contractually required, we report financial covenants based on the last filed quarterly or annual report, in this case our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Syndicated Facility based on the financial information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 As of each of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had 430.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Syndicated Facility, which had a fair value of 430.0 million. Our borrowings under the Syndicated Facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 7.443 , 6.792 and 2.876 for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 OSI2 Citibank Facility 
 On January 23, 2023, as a result of the consummation of the OSI2 Merger, we became party to a revolving credit facility, or, as amended and/or restated from time to time, the OSI2 Citibank Facility, with OSI 2 Senior Lending SPV, LLC, or OSI 2 SPV, our wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary, as the borrower, us, as collateral manager, each of the lenders from time to time party thereto, Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as collateral agent. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were able to borrow up to 400 million under the OSI2 Citibank Facility (subject to borrowing base and other limitations). As of September 30, 2024, the OSI2 Citibank Facility had a reinvestment period through May 25, 2027, during which advances may be made, and matures on January 26, 2029. Following the reinvestment period, OSI 2 SPV will be required to make certain mandatory amortization payments. Borrowings under the OSI2 Citibank Facility bear interest payable quarterly at a rate per year equal to SOFR plus 2.35 per annum. After the reinvestment period, the applicable spread is 3.35 per year. There is also a non-usage fee of 0.50 per year on the unused portion of the OSI2 Citibank Facility, payable quarterly; provided that if the unused portion of the OSI2 Citibank Facility is greater than 30 of the commitments under the OSI2 Citibank Facility, the non-usage fee will be based on an unused portion of 30 of the commitments under the OSI2 Citibank Facility. The OSI2 Citibank Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of OSI 2 SPV s assets. As part of the OSI2 Citibank Facility, OSI 2 SPV is subject to certain limitations as to how borrowed funds may be used and the types of loans that are eligible to be acquired by OSI 2 SPV including restrictions on sector concentrations, loan size, tenor and minimum investment ratings (or estimated ratings). The OSI2 Citibank Facility also contains certain requirements relating to interest coverage, collateral quality and portfolio performance, certain violations of which could result in the acceleration of the amounts due under the OSI2 Citibank Facility. 
 As of each of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had 280.0 million outstanding under the OSI2 Citibank Facility, which had a fair value of 280.0 million. Our borrowings under the OSI2 Citibank Facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 7.756 and 7.666 for the year ended September 30, 2024 and the period from January 23, 2023 to September 30, 2023, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2024 and the period from January 23, 2023 to September 30, 2023, we recorded interest expense (inclusive of fees) of 23.8 million and 14.6 million, respectively, related to the OSI2 Citibank Facility. 
 2025 Notes 
 On February 25, 2020, we issued 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes for net proceeds of 293.8 million after deducting OID of 2.5 million, underwriting commissions and discounts of 3.0 million and offering costs of 0.7 million. The OID on the 2025 Notes is amortized based on the effective interest method over the term of the notes. 
 2027 Notes 
 On May 18, 2021, we issued 350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes for net proceeds of 344.8 million after deducting OID of 1.0 million, underwriting commissions and discounts of 3.5 million and offering costs of 0.7 million.

 Regulated Investment Company Status and Distributions 
 
 We have qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As long as we continue to qualify as a RIC, we will not be subject to tax on our investment company taxable income (determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid) or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains is distributed, or deemed to be distributed as dividends, to stockholders on a timely basis. 
 Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Distributions declared and paid by us in a taxable year may differ from taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of taxable income derived from the current taxable year or the distribution of taxable income derived from the prior taxable year carried forward into and distributed in the current taxable year. Distributions also may include returns of capital. 
 To maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute (or be deemed to distribute) dividends, with respect to each taxable year, of an amount at least equal to 90 of our investment company taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any), determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. As a RIC, we are also subject to a federal excise tax, based on distribution requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis. We anticipate timely distribution of our taxable income in accordance with tax rules. For the calendar year 2022, we incurred 0.1 million of excise tax. We did not incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar year 2023. We do not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar year 2024. 
 We intend to distribute at least 90 of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income) to our stockholders. The covenants contained in our credit facilities may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders, and, as a result, could hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement associated with our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain 
 80 

circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal and taxable year fall below the total amount of our dividend distributions for that fiscal and taxable year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act and due to provisions in our credit facilities and debt instruments. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our taxable income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level. 
 A RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder elects to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to certain limitations regarding the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. 
 We may generate qualified net interest income or qualified net short-term capital gains that may be exempt from U.S. withholding tax when distributed to foreign stockholders. A RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. The following table, which may be subject to change as we finalize our annual tax filings, lists the percentage of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains for the year ended September 30, 2024. Year Ended Qualified Net Interest Income Qualified Short-Term Capital Gains September 30, 2024 85.7 
 We have adopted a DRIP that provides for the reinvestment of any distributions that we declare in cash on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then our stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving a cash distribution. If our shares are trading at a premium to net asset value, we typically issue new shares to implement the DRIP, with such shares issued at the greater of the most recently computed net asset value per share of our common stock or 95 of the current market value per share of our common stock on the payment date for such distribution. If our shares are trading at a discount to net asset value, we typically purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under the DRIP. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 We have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Oaktree and the Administration Agreement with Oaktree Administrator, an affiliate of Oaktree. Mr. John B. Frank, an interested member of our Board of Directors, has an indirect pecuniary interest in Oaktree.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in the valuations of our investment portfolio and interest rates. 
 Valuation Risk 
 Our investments may not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined by Oaktree, as our valuation designee. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith and valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of management judgment. In addition, our valuation methodology utilizes discount rates in part in valuing our investments, and changes in those discount rates may have an impact on the valuation of our investments. Accordingly, valuations by Oaktree do not necessarily represent the amounts which may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments. Estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investment existed, and the differences could be material to the financial statements. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments, cash and cash equivalents and idle fund investments. Our risk management procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and to continually monitor these risks. Our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates, including SOFR, EURIBOR, SONIA and prime rates, to the extent our debt investments include floating interest rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 88.4 of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) and 88.7 of our debt investment portfolio (at cost) bore interest at floating rates. As of September 30, 2023, 86.2 of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) and 86.4 of our debt investment portfolio (at cost) bore interest at floating rates. The composition of our floating rate debt investments by interest rate floor as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 in thousands) Fair Value of Floating Rate Portfolio Fair Value of Floating Rate Portfolio 0 388,959 15.5 169,693 7.2 >0 and 1 214,281 8.5 248,351 10.6 Total Floating Rate Investments 2,516,316 100.0 2,345,205 100.0 
 
 Based on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the approximate annualized net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations (excluding the impact of any potential incentive fees) of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investment and capital structure. However, there can be no assurances our portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels on increases in interest rates.

 We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on this review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for primarily all floating rate loans is indexed to the SOFR and/or an alternate base rate, which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. The following table shows a comparison of the interest rate base for our interest-bearing cash and outstanding investments, at principal, and our outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities of Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation (the Company), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets, and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 18, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 by correspondence with the custodian, syndication agents, underlying investees and others; when replies were not received from syndication agents, underlying investees and others, we performed other auditing procedures. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.

Valuation of investments using significant unobservable inputs 
 
 Description of the Matter As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company classified 2,723,732 thousand of its investments as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy (Level 3 investments) as of September 30, 2024. As described in Note 2 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s valuation designee, under the oversight of the Board of Directors, determined the fair value of the Company s Level 3 investments by using valuation techniques such as broker quotations, precedent transactions, enterprise value analyses or market yield techniques. These techniques require management to make judgments about the significant unobservable inputs including, among others, comparable EBITDA, revenue or asset multiples, market yields and broker quoted prices. Auditing the fair value of the Company s Level 3 investments involved a high degree of auditor judgment and extensive audit effort, as changes in the valuation techniques or significant unobservable inputs could have resulted in significant changes in fair value measurements. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls related to the Company s investment valuation process, including controls related to the Company s assessment of valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value measurements of the Level 3 investments. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company s valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used. Our audit procedures also included, for a sample of Level 3 investments, validating the mathematical accuracy of the fair value calculations and validating the accuracy of other relevant inputs used in estimating fair value measurement, such as investment terms and portfolio company financial information. For example, we compared publicly available information in the Company s valuation models (e.g., market yields, EBITDA, revenue, and asset multiples of comparable public companies and comparable public transactions) to information available from third-party market research providers. We also compared the significant company-specific inputs in the Company s valuation models to source documents, such as portfolio company financial statements and covenant certificates provided by the Company. To evaluate the reasonableness of significant unobservable inputs, we assessed whether these inputs were developed in a manner consistent with the Company s valuation policies and in some instances, we involved our valuation specialists to independently develop ranges using portfolio company and available market information to estimate the fair value of selected investments and we compared these ranges to the Company s fair value measurements. We also evaluated subsequent events and transactions and considered whether they corroborated or contradicted the Company s fair value measurements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities of the Company, including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November 18, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

investments on non-accrual status that in aggregate represented and of total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, there were investments on non-accrual status that in aggregate represented and of total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. 
 In connection with its investment in a portfolio company, the Company sometimes receives nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the portfolio company. When the Company receives nominal cost equity, the Company allocates its cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. 
 PIK Interest Income 
 The Company's investments in debt securities may contain PIK interest provisions. PIK interest, which generally represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company generally ceases accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if the Company does not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. The Company's decision to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; the Company's assessment of the portfolio company's business development success; information obtained by the Company in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. The Company's determination to cease accruing PIK interest is generally made well before the Company's full write-down of a loan or debt security. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that the Company will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of the loans or debt securities would be reduced by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on the Company s debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments in the Consolidated Financial Statements including for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by the Company to Oaktree. To maintain its status as a RIC, certain income from PIK interest may be required to be distributed to the Company s stockholders, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash and may never do so.

million of excise tax. The Company did t incur any U.S. federal excise tax for calendar year 2023. The Company does not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar year 2024. 
 The Company holds certain portfolio investments through taxable subsidiaries. The purpose of the Company's taxable subsidiaries is to permit the Company to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are "pass through" entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes in order to comply with the RIC tax requirements. The taxable subsidiaries are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and portfolio investments held by them are included in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements as portfolio investments and recorded at fair value. The taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. This income tax expense, if any, would be reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company uses the liability method to account for its taxable subsidiaries' income taxes. Using this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company recognizes deferred tax benefits associated with net operating loss carry forwards that it may use to offset future tax obligations. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which it expects to recover or settle those temporary differences. 
 FASB ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ("ASC 740"), provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Management's determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including an ongoing analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. Management has analyzed the Company's tax positions and has concluded that no liability for unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded related to uncertain tax positions taken on returns filed for open tax years 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Company identifies its major tax jurisdictions as U.S. Federal and California, and the Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change materially in the next 12 months.

The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. 
 
 When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, the determination is based upon the fact that the unobservable factors are significant to the overall fair value measurement. However, Level 3 financial instruments typically have both unobservable or Level 3 components and observable components (i.e. components that are actively quoted and can be validated by external sources). Accordingly, the appreciation (depreciation) in the tables below includes changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Transfers between levels are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period.

 Distributions 
 Distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the Board of Directors and is based on management s estimate of the Company s annual taxable income. Net realized capital gains, if any, may be distributed to stockholders or retained for reinvestment. 
 The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan DRIP that provides for reinvestment of any distributions the Company declares in cash on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Company s Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the Company s stockholders who have not opted out of the Company s DRIP will have their cash distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. If the Company s shares are trading at a premium to net asset value, the Company typically issues new shares to implement the DRIP with such shares issued at the greater of the most recently computed net asset value per share of common stock or of the current market price per share of common stock on the payment date for such distribution. If the Company s shares are trading at a discount to net asset value, the Company typically purchases shares in the open market in connection with the Company s obligations under the DRIP. 
 
 For income tax purposes, the Company has reported its distributions for the 2023 calendar year as ordinary income. The character of such distributions was appropriately reported to the Internal Revenue Service and stockholders for the 2023 calendar year. To the extent the Company s taxable earnings for a fiscal and taxable year fall below the amount of distributions

 __________ 
 (1) The Company's taxable income for the year ended September 30, 2024 is an estimate and will not be finally determined until the Company files its tax return for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. Therefore, the final taxable income may be different than the estimate. 
 The Company uses the liability method to account for its taxable subsidiaries' income taxes. Using this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company recognizes deferred tax benefits associated with net loss carry forwards that it may use to offset future tax obligations. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which it expects to recover or settle those temporary differences. 
 When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is probable that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining whether the deferred tax assets are realizable, the Company considers the period of expiration of the tax asset, historical and projected taxable income and tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. The deferred tax asset recognized by the Company, as it relates to the higher tax basis in the carrying value of certain assets compared to the book basis of those assets, will be recognized in future years by these taxable entities. Deferred tax assets are based on the amount of the tax benefit that the Company s management has determined is more likely than not to be realized in future periods. In determining the realizability of this tax benefit, management considered numerous factors that will give rise to pre-tax income in future periods. Among these are the historical and expected future book and tax basis pre-tax income of the Company and unrealized gains in the Company s assets at the determination date. Based on these and other factors, the Company determined that, as of September 30, 2024, million of the million deferred tax assets would not more likely than not be realized in future periods. 
 For the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a total benefit for income tax related to realized and unrealized gains (losses) of million, which was composed primarily of a current income tax benefit. For the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a total expense for income tax related to realized and unrealized gains (losses) of million, which was composed primarily of a deferred income tax expense. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized a provision for income tax related to net investment income of million, which was all current income tax expense. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company also recognized a total provision for income tax related to realized and unrealized gains (losses) of million, which was composed of (i) a current income tax expense of approximately million and (ii) a deferred income tax benefit of approximately million, which resulted from unrealized depreciation on investments held by the Company s wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries.

 million and million, respectively, reflecting the unpaid portion of the base management fees and incentive fees payable to Oaktree. 
 Investment Advisory Agreement 
 The Company is party to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays Oaktree a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to Oaktree and any incentive fees earned by Oaktree is ultimately borne by common stockholders of the Company. 
 The investment advisory agreement with Oaktree was amended and restated on March 19, 2021 in connection with the closing of the OCSI Merger, on January 23, 2023 in connection with the closing of OSI2 Merger and on November 14, 2024 to reflect a reduced base management fee. The term Investment Advisory Agreement refers collectively to the agreements with Oaktree. 
 Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect from year-to-year if approved annually by the Board of Directors of the Company or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of the directors of the Company who are not interested persons. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon days written notice to the other. The Investment Advisory Agreement may also be terminated, without penalty, upon the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company. 
 Base Management Fee 
 
 Effective as of July 1, 2024, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of total gross assets, including any investment made with borrowings, but excluding cash and cash equivalents; provided, however, that for the period from July 1, 2024 to January 23, 2025, the base management fee shall be calculated at such an annual rate as to cause (1) the base management fee less (2) previously agreed waivers of of base management fees per quarter (with such amount appropriately prorated for any partial quarter) to equal of the Company s gross assets, including any investments made with borrowings, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and the fee for any partial month or quarter is appropriately prorated. From May 3, 2019 through June 30, 2024, the base management fee was of total gross assets, including any investments made with borrowings, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents, provided that the base management fee on gross assets that exceeded the product of (A) and (B) the Company s net asset value was . The was calculated in accordance with the Investment Company Act. In connection with the OCSI Merger, Oaktree waived an aggregate of million of base management fees otherwise payable to Oaktree in the following the closing of the OCSI Merger on March 19, 2021 at a rate of per quarter (with such amount appropriately prorated for any partial quarter). In connection with the OSI2 Merger, Oaktree waived an aggregate of million of base management fees payable to Oaktree as follows: million at a rate of million per quarter (with such amount appropriately prorated for any partial quarter) in the first year following closing of the OSI2 Merger on January 23, 2023 and million at a rate of per quarter (with such amount appropriately prorated for any partial quarter) in the second year following closing of the OSI2 Merger. Oaktree also waived additional base management fees such that the total amount of waived base management fees (including those waived in connection with the OSI2 Merger described above) was million for each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 
 For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the base management fee incurred under the Investment Advisory Agreement was million (net of waiver), million (net of waiver) and million (net of waiver), respectively.

, subject to a catch up feature. 
 For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies, other than fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the fiscal quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID debt, instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. In addition, pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any amortization or accretion of any purchase premium or purchase discount to interest income resulting solely from merger-related accounting adjustments in connection with the assets acquired in the OCSI Merger or in the OSI2 Merger, in each case, including any premium or discount paid for the acquisition of such assets, solely to the extent that the inclusion of such merger-related accounting adjustments, in the aggregate, would result in an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the calculation of the incentive fee on income for each quarter is as follows: 
 
 No incentive fee is payable to Oaktree in any quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return rate of (the preferred return on net assets; 
 of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to in any fiscal quarter is payable to Oaktree. This portion of the incentive fee on income is referred to as the catch-up provision, and it is intended to provide Oaktree with an incentive fee of on all of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income when the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds on net assets in any fiscal quarter; and 
 For any quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds on net assets, the incentive fee on income is equal to of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, as the preferred return and catch-up will have been achieved. 
 
 There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. For the year ended September 30, 2024, Oaktree waived million of Part I incentive fees. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the first part of the incentive fee (incentive fee on income) incurred under the Investment Advisory Agreement was million (net of waiver), million and million, respectively. 
 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the second part of the incentive fee (the "capital gains incentive fee") is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) commencing with the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and equals of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 through the end of each subsequent fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Any realized capital gains, realized capital losses, unrealized capital appreciation and unrealized capital depreciation with respect to the Company s portfolio as of the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 are excluded from the calculations of the second part of the incentive fee. In addition, the calculation of realized capital gains, realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation does (1) not include any such amounts resulting solely from merger-related accounting adjustments in connection with the assets acquired in the OCSI Merger or in the OSI2 Merger, in each case, including any premium or discount paid for the acquisition of such assets, solely to the extent that the inclusion of such merger-related accounting adjustments, in the aggregate, would result in an increase in the capital gains incentive fee, (2) include any such amounts associated with the investments acquired in the OCSI Merger for the period from October 1, 2018 to the date of 
 155 

OAKTREE SPECIALTY LENDING CORPORATION 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated) 

million of capital gains incentive fees cumulatively under the Investment Advisory Agreement (net of waivers). For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not incur any capital gains incentive fees. 
 
 GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized on a theoretical "liquidation basis." A fee so calculated and accrued would not be payable under applicable law and may never be paid based upon the computation of capital gains incentive fees in subsequent periods. Amounts ultimately paid under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be consistent with the formula reflected in the Investment Advisory Agreement. This GAAP accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation. Any realized capital gains and losses and cumulative unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation with respect to the Company s portfolio as of the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 are excluded from the GAAP accrual. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires the Company to record a capital gains incentive fee equal to of such cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fees payable or capital gains incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. The resulting accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future or any accrued capital gains incentive fee will become payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were accrued capital gains incentive fees. For the year ended September 30, 2022, million of previously accrued capital gains incentive fees were reversed. As of September 30, 2024, the total accrued capital gains incentive fee liability was zero. 
 Indemnification 
 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, Oaktree and its officers, managers, partners, members (and their members, including the owners of their members), agents, employees, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from the Company for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Oaktree's services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as investment adviser.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 Not applicable. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in timely identifying, recording, processing, summarizing and reporting any material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 
 (b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and effected by such company's Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
 
 (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 
 
 (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

(c) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

Exhibit 4.2 
 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES 
 Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this Description of Securities is an exhibit. 
 (a) Common Stock, 0.01 par value per share 
 
 Our authorized capital stock consists of 250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of which 82,245,319 shares were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol OCSL. No stock has been authorized for issuance under any equity compensation plans. Under Delaware law, our stockholders generally will not be personally liable for our debts or obligations. 
 
 Under the terms of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or our certificate of incorporation, all shares of our common stock have equal rights as to earnings, assets, dividends and voting and, when they are issued, are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Distributions may be paid to the holders of our common stock if, as and when declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefore. Shares of our common stock have no preemptive, exchange, conversion or redemption rights and are freely transferable, except where their transfer is restricted by federal and state securities laws or by contract. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each share of our common stock would be entitled to share ratably in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we pay all debts and other liabilities. Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors. The holders of our common stock possess exclusive voting power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock are able to elect all of our directors, and holders of less than a majority of such shares are unable to elect any director. 
 
 (b) Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control 
 
 Limitation on Liability of Directors and Officers Indemnification and Advance of Expenses 
 Under our certificate of incorporation, we will fully indemnify any person who was or is involved in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) by reason of the fact that such person is or was one of our directors or officers or is or was serving at our request as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, against expenses (including attorney s fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding. Our 
 
 KE 115519856.1 

certificate of incorporation also provides that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except for a breach of their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. So long as we are regulated under the Investment Company Act, the above indemnification and limitation of liability will be limited by the Investment Company Act or by any valid rule, regulation or order of the SEC thereunder. The Investment Company Act provides, among other things, that a company may not indemnify any director or officer against liability to it or its stockholders to which he or she might otherwise be subject by reason of his or her willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office unless a determination is made by final decision of a court, by vote of a majority of a quorum of directors who are disinterested, non-party directors or by independent legal counsel that the liability for which indemnification is sought did not arise out of the foregoing conduct. 
 Delaware law also provides that indemnification permitted under the law shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the directors and officers may be entitled under the corporation s bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders or otherwise. 
 Our certificate of incorporation permits us to secure insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer or is or was serving at our request as a director or officer of another enterprise for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether the Delaware General Corporation Law would permit indemnification. 
 We have obtained liability insurance for our officers and directors. 
 Delaware Law and Certain Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions Anti-Takeover Measures 
 We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, the statute prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with interested stockholders for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes certain mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to exceptions, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with his, her or its affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years did own, 15 or more of the corporation s voting stock. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and fourth amended and restated bylaws, or bylaws, provide that 
 the Board of Directors be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in size as possible, with staggered three-year terms 
 
 directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares of our capital stock entitled to vote and 

KE 115519856.1 

any vacancy on the Board of Directors, however the vacancy occurs, including a vacancy due to an enlargement of the Board of Directors, may only be filled by vote of the directors then in office . 

The classification of our Board of Directors and the limitations on removal of directors and filling of vacancies could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring us. 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also provide that 
 
 any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders at an annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may only be taken if it is properly brought before such meeting and may not be taken by written action in lieu of a meeting and 
 special meetings of the stockholders may only be called by our Board of Directors, chairman or chief executive officer. 
 
 Our bylaws provide that, in order for any matter to be considered properly brought before a meeting, a stockholder must comply with requirements regarding advance notice to us. These provisions could delay until the next stockholders meeting stockholder actions which are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. These provisions may also discourage another person or entity from making a tender offer for our common stock, because such person or entity, even if it acquired a majority of our outstanding voting securities, would be able to take action as a stockholder (such as electing new directors or approving a merger) only at a duly called stockholders meeting, and not by written consent. 
 The Delaware General Corporation Law provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on any matter is required to amend a corporation s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless a corporation s certificate of incorporation or bylaws requires a greater percentage. Under our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, any amendment or repeal of the bylaws by the stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2 3 of the shares of our capital stock then outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of directors. The vote of at least 66 2 3 of the shares of our capital stock then outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, will be required to amend or repeal any provision of our certificate of incorporation pertaining to the Board of Directors, limitation of liability, indemnification, stockholder action or amendments to our certificate of incorporation. In addition, our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors to amend or repeal our bylaws by a majority vote.

 3. Compensation of the Adviser . 
 The Company agrees to pay, and the Adviser agrees to accept, as compensation for the services provided by the Adviser hereunder, a base management fee Base Management Fee and an incentive fee Incentive Fee as hereinafter set forth. The Adviser may agree to temporarily or permanently waive or defer, in whole or in part, the Base Management Fee and or the Incentive Fee. See Appendix A for examples of how these fees are calculated. The Company shall make any payments due hereunder to the Adviser or to the Adviser s designee as the Adviser may otherwise direct. Any portion of a deferred fee payable to the Adviser shall be deferred without interest and may be paid in any quarter prior to the termination of this Agreement as the Adviser may determine upon written notice to the Company. 
 3 

(a) As of the Effective Date, the Base Management Fee shall be calculated at an annual rate of 1.00 of the Company s gross assets, including any investments made with borrowings, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents provided, however, that for the period from July 1, 2024 to January 23, 2025, the Base Management Fee shall be calculated at such an annual rate as to cause (1) the Base Management Fee less (2) previously agreed waivers of 750,000 of Base Management Fees per quarter (with such amount appropriately prorated for any partial quarter) to equal 1.00 of the Company s gross assets, including any investments made with borrowings, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents. For purposes of this Agreement, the term cash and cash equivalents will have the meaning ascribed to it from time to time in the notes to the financial statements that the Company files with the SEC. The Base Management Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears, and shall be calculated based on the value of the Company s gross assets at the end of each fiscal quarter, and appropriately adjusted for any equity capital raises or repurchases during such quarter. 
 (b) Incentive Fee . The Incentive Fee shall consist of two parts, as follows 
 (i) The first part, referred to as the Incentive Fee on Income , shall be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding quarter (or upon termination of the Agreement, as of the termination date). The payment of the Incentive Fee on Income shall be subject to payment of a preferred return to investors each quarter, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 1.50 , subject to a catch up feature (as described below). 
 For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies, other than fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter (including the Base Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. In addition, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any amortization or accretion of any purchase premium or purchase discount to interest income resulting solely from merger-related accounting adjustments in connection with the assets acquired in the merger with Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation or in the merger with Oaktree Strategic Income II, Inc., in each case including any premium or discount paid for the acquisition of such assets, solely to the extent that the inclusion of such merger-related accounting adjustments, in the aggregate, would result in an increase in Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income. 
 The calculation of the Incentive Fee on Income for each quarter is as follows 
 4 

(A) No Incentive Fee on Income shall be payable to the Adviser in any calendar quarter in which the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.50 (the Preferred Return on net assets 
 (B) 100 of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the Preferred Return but is less than or equal to 1.8182 in any calendar quarter shall be payable to the Adviser. This portion of the company s Incentive Fee on Income is referred to as the catch up and is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 17.5 on all of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income reaches 1.8182 on net assets in any calendar quarter and 
 (C) For any quarter in which the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 1.8182 on net assets, the Incentive Fee on Income shall equal 17.5 of the amount of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, as the Preferred Return and catch-up will have been achieved. 
 (ii) The second part of the Incentive Fee, referred to as the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains , shall be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, and shall equal 17.5 of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 through the end of each subsequent fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees under this Agreement. Any realized capital gains, realized capital losses, unrealized capital appreciation and unrealized capital depreciation with respect to the Company s portfolio as of the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 shall be excluded from the calculations of the second part of the incentive fee. In addition, the calculation of realized capital gains, realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation shall (1) not include any such amounts resulting solely from merger-related accounting adjustments in connection with the assets acquired in the merger with Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation or in the merger with Oaktree Strategic Income II, Inc, in each case including any premium or discount paid for the acquisition of such assets, solely to the extent that the inclusion of such merger-related accounting adjustments, in the aggregate, would result in an increase in the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains, (2) include any such amounts associated with the investments acquired in the merger with Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation for the period from October 1, 2018 to the date of closing of such merger, solely to the extent that the exclusion of such amounts, in the aggregate, would result in an increase in the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains and (3) include any such amounts associated with the investments acquired in the merger with Oaktree Strategic Income II, Inc. for the period from August 6, 2018 to the date of closing of such merger, solely to the extent that the exclusion of such amounts, in the aggregate, would result in an increase in the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains. 
 5 

(c) In certain circumstances the Adviser, any Sub-Adviser, or any of their respective affiliates, may receive compensation from a portfolio company in connection with the Company s investment in such portfolio company. Any compensation received by the Adviser, Sub-Adviser, or any of their respective affiliates, attributable to the Company s investment in any portfolio company, in excess of any of the limitations in or exemptions granted from the 1940 Act, any interpretation thereof by the staff of the SEC, or the conditions set forth in any exemptive relief granted to the Adviser, any Sub-Adviser or the Company by the SEC, shall be delivered promptly to the Company and the Company will retain such excess compensation for the benefit of its shareholders. 
 4. Covenants of the Adviser . 
 The Adviser covenants that it will maintain its registration as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Adviser agrees that its activities will at all times be in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal and state laws governing its operations and investments. 
 5. Brokerage Commissions .
