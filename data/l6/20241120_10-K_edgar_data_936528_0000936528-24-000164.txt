Item 1. Business 
 
 General 
 
 Washington Federal Bank, a federally-insured Washington state chartered commercial bank dba WaFd Bank (the "Bank" or "WaFd Bank"), was founded on April 24, 1917 in Ballard, Washington and is engaged primarily in providing lending, depository, insurance and other banking services to consumers, mid-sized to large businesses, and owners and developers of commercial real estate. WaFd, Inc., a Washington corporation, was formed as the Bank s holding company in November, 1994. On September 27, 2023, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to its Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, with the Washington Secretary of State, to change its name from Washington Federal, Inc. to WaFd, Inc. This change was effective on September 29, 2023. As used throughout this document, the terms "WaFd," the "Company" or "we" or "us" and "our" refer to WaFd, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the term "Bank" or "WaFd Bank" refers to its bank operating subsidiary. The Company is headquartered in Seattle, Washington. 
 On November 9, 1982 the Company listed and began trading on the NASDAQ. Profitable operations have been recorded every year since going public. As of September 30, 2024, the stock traded at 91 times its original 1982 offering price, has paid 166 consecutive quarterly cash dividends and has returned 15,195 total shareholder return to those who invested 42 years ago. 
 On February 29, 2024, WaFd, Inc. closed its merger with Luther Burbank Corporation ("Luther Burbank" or "LBC"), a California corporation, effective as of 12:00am on March 1, 2024. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time Luther Burbank merged with and into the Company (the Corporate Merger ), with the Company surviving the Corporate Merger. Promptly following the Corporate Merger, Luther Burbank s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Luther Burbank Savings, merged with and into WaFd Bank with WaFd Bank as the surviving institution (the Bank Merger ). The Corporate Merger and the Bank Merger are collectively referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the Merger. The Merger added approximately 7.7 billion of LBC assets at fair value to the Company's balance sheet, and the Company assumed 50,175,000 in floating rate junior subordinated debentures, due June 2036 and June 2037, and 93,514,000 in 6.5 senior unsecured term notes which matured and were paid off on September 30, 2024. The Merger expanded WaFd Bank's footprint to nine western states with the addition of ten California branches of Luther Burbank. 
 The Company's fiscal year end is September 30th. All references herein to 2024, 2023 and 2022 represent balances as of September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, or activity for the fiscal years then ended. 
 The business of the Bank consists primarily of accepting deposits from the general public and investing these funds in loans of various types, including first lien mortgages on single-family dwellings, construction loans, land acquisition and development loans, loans on multi-family, commercial real estate and other income producing properties, home equity loans and business loans. The Bank also invests in certain United States government and agency obligations and other investments permitted by applicable laws and regulations. As of September 30, 2024, Washington Federal Bank has 210 branches located in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, California and Texas. Through the Bank's subsidiaries, the Company is also engaged in insurance brokerage activities. 
 
 The principal sources of funds for the Company's activities are retained earnings, loan repayments, net deposit inflows, borrowings and repayments and sales of investments. WaFd's principal sources of revenue are interest on loans and interest and dividends on investments. Its principal expenses are interest paid on deposits, credit costs, general and administrative expenses, interest on borrowings and income taxes. 
 
 The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by its primary state regulator, the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (the "WDFI"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), its primary federal regulator, which insures its deposits up to applicable limits, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"). The Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve"). 
 
 The regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities. Any change in such regulation, whether by the WDFI, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the CFPB or the U.S. Congress, could have a significant impact on the Company and its operations. See Regulation section below.

Lending Programs and Policies. The Bank's lending activities include commercial and consumer loans, including the following loan categories. 
 Commercial real estate loans . The Bank makes loans on a variety of commercial real estate CRE types which are generally secured by the subject property. Management differentiates multi-family properties from the rest of our CRE portfolio as these loans have key differences in the way they are handled from underwriting through monitoring. 
 The following table provides detail of the amortized cost of non-multi family CRE loans by property type: 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 in thousands) Office 783,363 815,776 813,103 Industrial 705,401 591,507 481,473 Retail 399,276 377,300 370,139 Warehouse/Self Storage 295,275 252,677 244,985 Medical/dental 265,495 198,208 167,200 Mixed Use 229,351 232,564 243,430 Hotel/motel 205,895 228,503 219,911 Other 848,099 613,566 570,871 Total commercial real estate loans 3,732,155 3,310,101 3,111,112 
 
 Within the types listed above, a CRE subject property could be either owner or non-owner occupied. The following table provides the amortized cost of CRE loans by occupation status:

 In underwriting, the Bank considers a number of factors, which include the projected net cash flow to the loan's debt service requirement, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower's experience in owning or managing similar properties. CRE loans are originated in amounts up to 75 of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. 
 With CRE loans, credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic and societal conditions on income-producing properties and the primary source of cash flow for repayment being spread across multiple tenants (non-owner). Repayment of CRE loans depends upon the successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from the property is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified at origination on the basis of the property's income and debt service ratio. 
 Multi-family residential loans . Multi-family residential (five or more dwelling units) loans generally are secured by multi-family rental properties, such as apartment buildings. In underwriting multi-family residential loans, the Bank considers the same factors considered for CRE loans. Like CRE, multi-family residential loans are originated in amounts up to 75 of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. 
 Loans secured by multi-family residential real estate generally involve different credit risk than single-family residential loans and carry larger loan balances. This different credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic and societal conditions on income-

producing properties, the primary source of cash flow for repayment being spread across multiple tenants, the effects of government orders such as eviction forbearance and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. 
 It is the Bank's policy to obtain title insurance ensuring that it has a valid first lien on the mortgaged real estate serving as collateral for the loan. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance prior to closing and, when required by regulation, flood insurance. Borrowers may be required to advance funds on a monthly basis, together with each payment of principal and interest, to a mortgage escrow account from which the Bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes, hazard insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums when due. 
 Commercial and industrial loans . The Bank makes various types of business loans to customers in its market area for working capital, acquiring real estate, equipment or other business purposes, such as acquisitions. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of ten years. The loans are either negotiated on a fixed-rate basis or carry adjustable interest rates indexed to the Secured Overnight Funding Rate ("SOFR"), Prime Rate or another market rate. 
 
 Commercial loans are made based upon assessment of the borrower's ability and willingness to repay along with an evaluation of secondary repayment sources such as the value and marketability of collateral. Most such loans are extended to closely held businesses and the personal guaranty of the principal is usually obtained. Commercial loans have a relatively high risk of default compared to residential real estate loans. Pricing of commercial loans is based on the credit risk of the borrower with consideration given to the overall relationship of the borrower, including deposits and contributed equity/loan-to-value ratio. The acquisition of business deposits is an important focus of this business line. The Bank provides a full line of treasury management products to support the depository needs of its clients. 
 Construction loans . The Bank originates construction loans to finance construction of single-family and multi-family residences as well as commercial properties. Loans made to builders are generally tied to an interest rate index and normally have maturities of two years or less or are structured such that they convert to a permanent loan after the completion of construction or stabilization of the property. Loans made to individuals for construction of their home generally are 30-year fixed rate loans. The Bank's policies provide that for residential construction loans, loans may be made for 85 or less of the construction cost or 80 of the appraised value of the property upon completion, whichever is less. As a result of activity over the past four decades, the Bank believes that builders of single-family residences in its primary market areas consider the Bank to be a construction lender of choice. Because of this history, the Bank has developed a staff with in-depth land development and construction experience and working relationships with selected builders based on their operating histories and financial stability. 
 Construction lending involves a higher level of risk than single-family residential lending due to the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers and the effects of general economic conditions in the home building industry. Moreover, a construction loan can involve additional risks because of the complexities of completing the construction, the inherent difficulty in estimating the cost (including interest) of the project, the future cash flows and the property's value at completion of the project. 
 Land development loans . The Bank's land development loans are of a short-term nature and are generally made for 75 or less of the appraised value of the unimproved property. Funds are disbursed periodically at various stages of completion as authorized by the Bank's personnel. The interest rate on these loans typically adjust daily or monthly in accordance with a designated index. 
 Land development loans involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on owner-occupied real estate. Mitigation of risk of loss on a land development loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value at completion of development compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of development and the financial strength of the borrower. 
 Permanent land loans . The Bank's permanent land loans (also called consumer lot loans) are generally made on improved land, with the intent of building a primary or secondary residence. These loans are limited to 70 or less of the appraised value of the property, up to a maximum loan amount of 1,500,000. The interest rate on permanent land loans is generally fixed for 20 years. 
 Single-family residential loans . The Bank originates 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by single-family residences. Moreover, it is the Bank's general policy to include in the documentation evidencing its conventional mortgage loans a due-on-sale clause, which facilitates adjustment of interest rates on such loans when the property securing the loan is sold or transferred. 
 All of the Bank's mortgage lending is subject to written, nondiscriminatory underwriting standards, loan origination procedures and lending policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). Property valuations are required 
 9 

on all real estate loans. Appraisals are prepared by independent appraisers, reviewed by staff of the Bank, and approved by the Bank's management. Property evaluations are sometimes utilized in lieu of appraisals on single-family real estate loans of 250,000 or less and are reviewed by the Bank's staff. Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the borrower's ability to repay and the more significant items on these applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements or written confirmations. 
 Depending on the size of the loan involved, a varying number of officers of the Bank must approve the loan application before the loan can be granted. Federal guidelines limit the amount of a real estate loan made to a specified percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, as determined by an evaluation at the time the loan is originated. This is referred to as the loan-to-value ratio. The Board sets the maximum loan-to-value ratios for each type of real estate loan offered by the Bank. 
 When establishing general reserves for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80 that are not insured by private mortgage insurance, the Bank considers the additional risk inherent in these products, as well as their relative loan loss experience, and provides reserves when deemed appropriate. The total balance for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80 at origination as of September 30, 2024, was 315,704,000, with allocated reserves of 2,939,000. 
 Consumer loans . The Bank's non-mortgage consumer loan portfolio consists of prime quality student loans acquired from an independent financial investment firm that retains 1 of each loan, plus various other non-mortgage consumer loans including personal lines of credit and credit cards. 
 
 Home equity loans . The Bank extends revolving lines of credit to consumers that are secured by a first or second mortgage on a single-family residence. The interest rate on these loans adjusts monthly indexed to prime. Total loan-to-value ratios when combined with any underlying first liens held by the Bank are limited to 85 or less. Total loan-to-value ratios are limited to 80 or less when underlying first liens are held by any other investor. Loan terms are a ten-year draw period followed by a fifteen-year amortization period. 
 Origination and Purchase of Loans. The Bank has general authority to lend anywhere in the United States; however, its primary lending areas are within the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, California and Texas. Loan originations come from a variety of sources. Residential loan originations result from referrals from real estate brokers, walk-in customers, purchasers of property in connection with builder projects that are financed by the Bank, mortgage brokers and refinance activity for existing customers. Business purpose loans are obtained primarily by direct solicitation of borrowers and ongoing relationships. 
 
 The Bank also purchases loans and mortgage-backed securities when lending rates and mortgage volume for new loan originations in its market area do not fulfill its needs.

 Interest Rates, Loan Fees and Service Charges. Interest rates charged by the Bank on mortgage loans are primarily determined by the competitive loan rates offered in its lending areas and in the secondary market. Mortgage loan rates reflect factors such as general interest rates, the supply of money available to the industry and the demand for such loans. General economic conditions, the regulatory programs and policies of federal and state agencies, including the Federal Reserve Bank s monetary policies, changes in tax laws and governmental budgetary programs influence these factors. 
 The Bank receives fees for originating loans in addition to various fees and charges related to existing loans, including prepayment charges, late charges and assumption fees. In making one-to-four- family home mortgage loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee and as part of the loan application, the borrower pays the Bank for out-of-pocket costs, such as the appraisal fee, whether or not the borrower closes the loan. The interest rate charged is normally the prevailing rate at the time the loan application is approved and accepted. In the case of construction loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee. Loan origination fees and other terms of multi-family residential loans are individually negotiated. 

Investment Activities 
 The Bank is obligated by its regulators to maintain adequate liquidity and does so by holding cash and cash equivalents and by investing in securities. These investments may include, among other things, certain certificates of deposit, repurchase 
 11 

agreements, bankers acceptances, loans to financial institutions whose deposits are federally-insured, federal funds, United States government and agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities. 
 
 Sources of Funds 
 
 General. Deposits are the primary source of the Bank s funds for use in lending and other general business purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan repayments, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB - DM"), borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB"), and from investment repayments and sales. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by general interest rates, money market conditions, the availability of FDIC insurance and the market perception of the Company s financial stability. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in normal sources of funds, such as deposit inflows at lower than projected levels. Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded activities and to manage interest rate risk. Borrowing capacity and availability is influenced by interest rates, market conditions, availability of collateral and the market's perception of the Bank's financial stability. 
 
 Deposits. The Bank relies on a mix of deposit types, including business and personal checking accounts, term certificates of deposit, and other savings deposit alternatives that have no fixed term, such as money market accounts and passbook savings accounts. The Bank offers several consumer checking account products, both interest bearing and non-interest bearing and three business checking accounts, two of which target small businesses with relatively simple and straightforward banking needs and one for larger, more complex business depositors with an account that prices monthly based on the volume and type of activity. Savings and money market accounts are offered to both businesses and consumers, with interest paid after certain threshold amounts are exceeded. 
 
 The Bank s deposits are obtained primarily from residents of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, California and Texas. 
 
 Borrowings. The Bank has a credit line with the FHLB - DM for up to 45 of total assets depending on specific collateral eligibility. The Bank obtains advances from the FHLB - DM based upon the security of the FHLB capital stock it owns and certain of its loans, provided certain standards related to credit worthiness have been met. Such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities, and the FHLB - DM prescribes acceptable uses to which the advances pursuant to each program may be put, as well as limitations on the size of such advances. Depending on the program, such limitations are based either on a fixed percentage of assets or the Company's credit worthiness. FHLB advances are used to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposit accounts and to fund expansion of the Bank's lending. 
 
 The Bank may need to borrow funds for short periods of time to meet day-to-day financing needs. In these instances, funds are borrowed from other financial institutions or the Federal Reserve Bank, for periods generally ranging from one to seven days at the then current borrowing rate. The Bank also elected to utilize the FRB's Bank Term Funding Program (the "BTFP") to leverage its highly favorable terms to fortify the Bank's liquidity position. These borrowings are repayable at any time without penalty and were the lowest cost funding source available. The Federal Reserve ceased making new BTFP loans on March 11, 2024. 
 
 The Bank also participates in the FRB of San Francisco Borrower-in-Custody program which collateralizes primary credit borrowings and serves as a backstop for the FHLB - DM credit line. Due to differing program requirements between the FHLB - DM and FRB of San Francisco, participating in both increases the amount of eligible collateral that may be pledged in support of contingent liquidity needs. 
 
 The Bank Merger provided a credit line with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB - SF) in support of LBC borrowings from the FHLB - SF, but the Bank is unable to take down new advances against this line as a bank is not allowed to belong to more than one FHLB. The FHLB - SF credit line is secured by a line-item pledge of single-family residential mortgages that are specifically identified. 
 For further information on these activities, see Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

Additional information will be provided in the Company s forthcoming 2024 Community and Social Responsibility Report which will be made available on the Company s website. Nothing on our website, including the aforementioned report, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. 

The Company 
 
 General. The Company is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 Regulation. The Company operates in a highly regulated industry. The regulatory structure governing the Company s operations is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers, and not to benefit our shareholders. As part of this regulatory structure, the Company is subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Under this structure, regulators have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the Company s operations if they determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. 
 
 Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders. In order to ensure the Company's programs and operations are in compliance with regulatory requirements, the Company has and will continue to incur significant costs in order to comply in accordance with its responsibilities. 
 
 For further information on regulatory matters, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data as well as the "Risk Factors" section of this report and the "USA Patriot Act of 2001" discussion below. 
 
 Sections below include a description of certain laws and regulations that relate to the regulation of the Company and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, and descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 15 

Restrictions on Activities and Acquisitions. Bank holding companies are subject to a variety of restrictions on their activities and the acquisitions they can make. Generally, the activities or acquisition of a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company are limited to those that constitute banking or managing or controlling banks or which are closely related to banking. In addition, without the prior approval of the FRB, bank holding companies are generally prohibited from acquiring more than 5 of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, taking any action that causes a bank to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, or merging with another bank holding company. 
 
 Control of Company or Bank. Pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, (the CIBC Act individuals, corporations or other entities acquiring Company equity interests may, alone or together with other investors, be deemed to control a holding company or a bank. If an acquisition is deemed to constitute control of the holding company or bank and is not subject to approval under the Bank Holding Company Act or certain other statutes, such person or group will be required to file a notice under the CIBC Act. Generally, ownership of, or power to vote, more than 25 of any class of voting securities constitutes control. In the case of a bank or bank holding company the securities of which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), ownership of or power to vote more than 10 of any class of voting securities creates a presumption of control. 
 
 Source of Strength. Under long-standing FRB policy, a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and management strength to its subsidiary bank. Under this policy, a bank holding company is expected to stand ready to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial adversity and to maintain financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to assist its subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine by adopting a statutory provision requiring, among other things, that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks. 
 
 Restrictions on Company Dividends. The Company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is affected by several factors. Since the Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations of its own, the Company may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders if the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company. The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to various regulatory restrictions. 
 
 In addition, the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to rules and policies of the FRB. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company s expected future needs and financial condition. Capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve, effective January 2015, may limit the Company s ability to pay dividends if the Company fails to meet certain requirements under the rules. In addition, if we do not or are unable to pay quarterly dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, we may not pay a dividend to the holders of our Common Stock. See Washington Federal Bank, wholly-owned operating subsidiary - Restrictions on Dividends below. 
 
 Since the Company is a Washington state corporation, it is also subject to restrictions under Washington corporate law relating to dividends. Generally, under Washington law, a corporation may not pay a dividend if, after giving effect to the dividend, the corporation would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of business or the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (with some exceptions) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment, to satisfy the dissolution preferences of senior equity securities. 
 
 Enterprise Risk Management. The Company faces a number of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operations risk, cybersecurity risk, regulatory risk, compliance and legal risk, strategic risk, and reputational risk. The Risk Management Committee of the Board RMC establishes the Company's risk appetite and sets appropriate risk limits and policies. The RMC is responsible for providing ongoing review, guidance and oversight of the Company's enterprise risk management function. Management is responsible for managing the Company's risks on a day-to-day basis in accordance with the policies established by the Board. 
 
 The Company's Chief Risk Officer CRO chairs the Enterprise Risk Management Committee ERMC ), a management-level committee that is responsible for executing the risk management framework adopted by the Board. The ERMC maintains enterprise-wide oversight of risk assessment, monitoring and reporting. The ERMC meets at least quarterly to identify, evaluate, monitor, and account for new, existing and emerging risks to the Company. Identified risks are evaluated, analyzed, prioritized and tracked by the ERMC in a manner to be compatible with effective internal controls, risk management practices and the policies adopted by the Board. The ERMC develops risk management programs and processes to incorporate risk considerations into day-to-day business activities across the Company s risk categories, business lines and functions. To support the ERMC s risk management function, certain types of risks are overseen by other management level committees. For 
 16 

example, the Company s Asset Liability Committee is responsible for managing interest rate and liquidity risks and the credit administration department tracks credit risks. 
 
 On at least a quarterly basis, the Company s CRO, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Credit Officer, and other members of management report directly to the RMC to provide reporting on risk levels, key risks, emerging risks and the Company s compliance with the risk management framework, risk limits and risk appetites adopted by the RMC. 
 
 The Company carries out its risk management practices through its three lines of defense model, which is designed to establish effective checks and balances within its risk management framework. The first line of defense is business units and process owners within the Company which are responsible for maintaining effective internal controls and executing risk and control procedures on a day to day basis. The second line of defense is the Company s risk management, compliance and other control functions which are responsible for ensuring that the first line of defense is properly designed, in place, and operating effectively. The third line of defense is the Company s internal audit function, which provides independent assessment and assurance regarding the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls. 

Washington Federal Bank, wholly-owned operating subsidiary 
 
 General. The Bank is a federally-insured Washington state chartered commercial bank dba WaFd Bank. The WDFI is the Bank's primary state regulator and the FDIC is its primary federal regulatory. The Bank is a member of the FDIC and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits of the Depository Insurance Fund DIF ), which is administered by the FDIC. 
 
 Regulation. The WDFI and FDIC have extensive authority over the operations of the Bank. As part of this authority, the Bank is required to file periodic reports with the WDFI and FDIC and is subject to periodic examinations by the WDFI and FDIC. As a Washington State chartered commercial bank with branches in the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, California and Texas, the Bank is subject not only to the applicable laws and regulations of Washington State, but is also subject to the applicable laws and regulations of these other states in which it does business. Various laws and regulations prescribe the investment and lending authority of the Bank, and the Bank is prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. While the Bank has broad authority to engage in all types of lending activities, a variety of restrictions apply to certain other investments by the Bank. 
 
 Interstate Banking . Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, a bank holding company, with prior approval of the FRB, may acquire an out-of-state bank; banks in states that do not prohibit out-of-state mergers may merge with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, and a bank may establish a de novo branch out of state if such branching is permitted by the other state for state banks chartered by such other state. 
 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage was permanently increased from 100,000 to 250,000 per depositor, per institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio, which the FDIC is required to set each year for the DIF, to 1.35 . The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The FDIC has established a higher reserve ratio of 2 as a long-term goal beyond what is required by statute. 
 
 Brokered Deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is well-capitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A depository institution that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of national and local rate caps set by the FDIC and published on its website. 
 
 Transactions with Affiliates; Insider Loans. Under current federal law, all transactions between and among a bank and its affiliates, including holding companies, are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, these requirements limit extensions of credit and certain other such transactions by the bank to affiliates to a percentage of the institution's capital and generally such transactions must be collateralized. Generally, all affiliate transactions must be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, a bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in non-banking activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire 
 17 

shares of any affiliate that is not a subsidiary. Federal law authorizes the imposition of additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates if necessary to protect the safety and soundness of a bank. 
 
 Extensions of credit by a bank to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, generally prohibits loans to any such individual where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15 of an institution's unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10 of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Section 22(h) permits loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to employees of a subject bank provided that no preference is given to any officer, director or principal shareholder, or related interest thereto, over any other employee. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution's unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 
 
 The affiliate transaction rules in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act broaden the definition of affiliate and apply these rules to securities lending, repurchase agreements and derivatives. These rules also strengthen collateral requirements and limit Federal Reserve exemptive authority. Further, the definition of extension of credit for transactions with executive officers, directors and principal shareholders includes credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction, a repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement or a securities lending or borrowing transaction. These provisions have not had a material effect on the Company or the Bank. 
 
 Restrictions on Dividends. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to the Company depends upon its earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies, including the capital conservation buffer requirement. Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may make any capital distribution (which includes a cash dividend) if, after making the distribution, the institution would be undercapitalized, as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. In addition, under Washington law, no bank may declare or pay any dividend in an amount greater than its retained earnings without the prior approval of the WDFI. WDFI also has the power to require any bank to suspend the payment of any and all dividends. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members for making home mortgage loans, as well as loans for affordable housing and community development. Each FHLB serves members within its assigned region and is funded primarily through proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Loans are made to members in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, total FHLB advances to the Bank amounted to 2,192,874,000. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines. The Bank also acquired the stock of the FHLB San Francisco in the Merger but is not a member of this FHLB. At September 30, 2024, the Bank held 73,910,000 in FHLB of Des Moines stock and 21,707,000 in FHLB of San Francisco stock, which was in compliance with requirements. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. Banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") and related regulations of the FDIC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (together, the "Fair Lending Laws") prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. Failure to comply with the Fair Lending Laws could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, the CFPB and other federal regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice. 
 
 USA Patriot Act of 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ("Patriot Act"), through amendments to the federal Bank Secrecy Act BSA ), substantially broadened the scope of United States anti money-laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial scope of United States jurisdiction. The United States Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations under the Patriot Act that apply to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate risk-based programs reasonably designed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply satisfactorily with all relevant Patriot Act and BSA requirements, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 
 
 Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 AML Act was enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act and requires the U.S. Treasury Department to issue National Anti-Money Laundering and 
 18 

Countering the Financing of Terrorism Priorities ("AML/CFT"), which occurred in June 2021. The AML Act also includes a requirement to conduct studies and issue regulations that may alter some of the due diligence, recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the BSA and Patriot Act impose on financial institutions. The AML Act also promotes increased information-sharing and use of technology and increases penalties for violations of the BSA and includes whistleblower incentives, both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements. Bank holding companies and federally insured banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. The Federal Reserve establishes capital standards applicable to all bank holding companies, and the WDFI and FDIC establish capital standards applicable to Washington state chartered, non-member banks. The capital rules reflect, in part, certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (which standards are commonly referred to as Basel III as well as requirements contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 
 The capital rules require a capital ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk based assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments (subject to certain adjustments) as well as accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI except to the extent that the Company and the Bank exercise a one-time irrevocable option to exclude certain components of AOCI, which the Company and the Bank have done. Tier 1 capital also includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and limited amounts of minority interests. Regulatory deductions from capital include goodwill and intangible assets. The capital rules prescribe the manner in which certain capital elements are determined, including but not limited to, requiring certain deductions related to mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and supplementary capital. Supplementary capital consists of certain capital instruments that do not qualify as core capital as well as general valuation loan and lease loss allowances up to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets. Supplementary capital may be used to satisfy the risk-based requirement only in an amount equal to the amount of Tier 1 capital. 
 
 In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance-sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor based on the risks inherent in the type of assets held by an institution. The risk categories range from 0 for low-risk assets such as U.S. Treasury securities and GNMA securities to 1,250 for various types of loans and other assets deemed to be of higher risk. Single-family residential loans having loan-to-value ratios not exceeding 90 and meeting certain additional criteria, as well as certain multi-family residential loans, qualify for a 50 risk-weight treatment. The book value of each asset is multiplied by the risk factor applicable to the asset category, and the sum of the products of this calculation equals total risk-weighted assets. The rules set forth the methods of calculating certain risk-based assets, which in turn affects the calculation of risk-based ratios. Higher or more sensitive risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, among which are commercial real estate, credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credit that are 90 days past due or are non-accrual, foreign exposures, certain corporate exposures, securitization exposures, equity exposures and in certain cases mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. 
 
 Both the Company and the Bank are required to have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 . In addition, both the Company and the Bank are required to have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.0 and a total risk-based ratio of 8.0 . Both the Company and the Bank are required to establish a conservation buffer, consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, equal to 2.5 . The capital conservation buffer is designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers outside periods of stress, which can be drawn down as losses are incurred. An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 
 
 The Federal Reserve and the FDIC are also authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. Management believes that the current capital levels of the Company and the Bank are sufficient to be in compliance with the fully phased-in standards under the rules. 
 
 Any bank holding company or bank that fails to meet the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions. Such actions could include a capital directive, a cease and desist or consent order, civil money penalties, restrictions on an institution's operations and/or the appointment of a conservator or receiver. FRB, FDIC and WDFI capital regulations provide that such supervisory actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions. 
 
 For information regarding compliance with each of these capital requirements by the Company and the Bank as of September 30, 2024, see Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof. 
 
 19 

Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution s category depends upon its capital levels in relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework. 
 
 The prompt corrective action rules, which apply to the Bank but not the Company, are modified to include a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio and to increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. For example, the requirements for the Bank to be considered well-capitalized under the rules are a 5.0 Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6.5 common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio, an 8.0 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 10.0 total risk-based capital ratio. To be adequately capitalized, those ratios are 4.0 , 4.5 . 6.0 and 8.0 , respectively. 
 
 An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits, generally. Any institution that is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. Federal law authorizes the FDIC to reclassify a well-capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category. The FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded the requirements of a well-capitalized institution. 
 
 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests ("DFAST"). On July 6, 2018, bank regulatory agencies (the FRB, FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ("EGRRCPA") on financial institutions. The EGRRCPA gave immediate relief from stress testing for applicable bank holding companies but not financial institutions until November 25, 2019. Pursuant to direction from the Bank's regulators, the Bank was provided similar relief and is no longer required to submit company-run annual stress tests. Notwithstanding these amendments to the stress testing requirements, the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than 100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process. Although the Bank will continue to monitor its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators, the Bank will no longer conduct company-run stress testing as a result of the legislative and regulatory amendments. The Bank continues to use customized stress testing to support the business and as part of its risk management and capital planning process. 
 
 EGRRCPA also enacted several important changes in some technical compliance areas that we believe will help reduce our regulatory burden, including: 
 
 Prohibiting federal banking regulators from imposing higher capital standards on High Volatility Commercial Real Estate HVCRE exposures unless they are for acquisition, development or construction ADC ), and clarifying ADC status; 
 Exempting from appraisal requirements certain transactions involving real property in rural areas and valued at less than 400,000; and 
 Directing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to provide guidance on the applicability of the Truth in Lending and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act Integrated Disclosure rule to mortgage assumption transactions and construction-to-permanent home loans, as well the extent to which lenders can rely on model disclosures that do not reflect recent regulatory changes. 
 
 Despite the improvements for mid-size financial institutions such as the Company that has resulted from EGRRCPA, many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations remain in place and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. In addition, the EGRRCPA requires the enactment of a number of implementing regulations, the details of which may have a material effect on the ultimate impact of the law. 

Cybersecurity. The federal banking agencies have established certain expectations with respect to an institution's information security and cybersecurity programs, with an increasing focus on risk management, processes related to information technology and operational resiliency, and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services. In January 2020, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a statement reminding supervised financial institutions of sound cybersecurity risk management principles that expanded on areas articulated in the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards written in Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Sections 501 and 505(b) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 
 
 20 

State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which the Company operates. 
 
 In November 2021, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computer security incidents. Under the final rule, a bank holding company, such as the Company, and an FDIC-supervised insured depository institution, such as the Bank, are required to notify the Federal Reserve or FDIC, respectively, within 36 hours of incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule to notify any affected bank client it provides services to as soon as possible when it determines it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, covered services provided by that entity to the Bank for four or more hours. 
 
 See Item 1C - Cybersecurity , for additional disclosures regarding the Company's cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. 
 
 Financial Privacy. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended, a financial institution may not disclose non-public personal information about a consumer to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various disclosure requirements and the consumer has not elected to opt out of the information sharing. The financial institution must provide its customers with a notice of its privacy policies and practices. The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and other financial regulatory agencies issued regulations implementing notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution's ability to disclose non-public personal information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties. 
 
 In addition, privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus, and several states have recently enacted consumer privacy laws that impose significant compliance obligations with respect to personal information. For example, the Company is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA and its implementing regulations. The CCPA gives consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer s personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including an exemption applicable to information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended. In November 2020, voters in the state of California approved the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA ), a ballot measure that amends and supplements the substantive requirements of the CCPA by, among other things, expanding certain rights relating to personal information and its use, collection, and disclosure by covered businesses and providing certain mechanisms for administration and enforcement of the statue by creating the California Privacy Protection Agency, a watchdog privacy agency. Similar laws may in the future be adopted by other states where the Company does business. The Company has made and will make operational adjustments in accordance with the requirements of the CCPA and other state privacy laws. 
 
 Furthermore, privacy and data protection areas are expected to receive further attention at the federal level. Congress and federal regulatory agencies are considering similar laws or regulations that could create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data. On April 1, 2022, the federal banking agencies new rule became effective, providing for new notification requirements for banking organizations and their service providers for significant cybersecurity incidents. Specifically, the new rule requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible, and no later than 36 hours after, the discovery of a computer-security incident that rises to the level of a notification incident as defined by the rule. Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the viability of a banking organization s operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule to notify any affected bank to which it provides services as soon as possible when it determines it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, covered services provided by that entity to the bank for four or more hours. The potential effects of state or federal privacy and data protection laws on the Company s business cannot be determined at this time and will depend both on whether such laws are adopted by states in which the Company does business and/or at the federal level and the requirements imposed by any such laws.

Taxation 
 
 In addition to federal income tax, the Company is also subject to income, franchise, excise or gross receipts tax in states (and some cities) where the Company has branches or is deemed to have sufficient nexus for tax purposes. The Company generally files consolidated federal and state income tax returns with its subsidiaries. 
 
 The Company's federal income tax returns are open and subject to potential examination by the IRS for fiscal year 2021 and later. 

Competition 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include other banks, savings associations, community banks, credit unions, fintech companies and other financial intermediaries, and new market participants offering services similar to those that we offer. We compete with some competitors within our geographic market area, and with others on a product specific basis, such as the residential mortgage market. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to provide first-rate, friendly and professional customer service and deliver the banking solutions that our customers want and need. We are also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain employees while managing compensation and other costs.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Ownership of our Common Stock involves risk. Investors should carefully consider, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors. The risks described below may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks we face; additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently considered to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business. 
 
 Operational Risks 
 
 Fluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Significant increases in market interest rates on loans, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect both our ability to originate new loans and our ability to grow. Beginning early in 2022, in response to growing signs of inflation, the Federal Reserve Bank increased interest rates rapidly, causing the federal funds rate to reach a 22-year high. Although the FRB reduced its benchmark rates in September 2024, the inflationary outlook in the United States is currently uncertain. Rapid changes in interest rates make it difficult for the Bank to balance its loan and deposit portfolios, which may adversely affect our results of operations by, for example, reducing asset yields or spreads, creating operating and system issues, or having other adverse impacts on our business. Persistent inflation could lead to higher interest rates, which could, in turn, increase the borrowing costs of our customers, making it more difficult for them to repay their loans or other obligations. High interest rates could also push down asset prices and weaken economic activity. 
 
 Further, our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference (or spread between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is a function of the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the amounts of the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the FOMC and market interest rates. Furthermore, movements in interest rates, the pace at which such movements occur and the volume and mix of our interest-bearing assets and liabilities influence the level of net interest income. The cost of customer deposits is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is driven by the FOMC. However, the yields generated by long-term loans, such as single-family residential and multifamily mortgage loans, and securities are typically driven by longer-term (10 year) interest rates, which are set by the market and vary from day to day. 
 
 As a result of the interest rate increases experienced in 2022 and 2023, our interest expense on both deposits and borrowings increased significantly. Because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread, and, in turn, our profitability. For example, if the interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on interest-earning assets, the result could be a reduction in our net interest income and with it, a reduction in earnings. The same could be true if interest rates on interest-earning assets decline faster than the rates on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted if the interest rates on interest-earning assets decline more quickly than the interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates could affect the Bank's ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits; the fair values of its securities and other financial assets; the fair values of its liabilities; and the average lives of its loan and securities portfolios. Additionally, decreases in interest rates could lead to increased loan refinancing activity, which, in turn, would alter the balance of our interest-earning assets and impact net interest income. Increases in interest rates could reduce loan refinancing activity, which could result in compression of the spread between loan yields and more quickly rising funding rates. We may also be exposed to movements in market rates to a degree not experienced by other financial institutions, as a result of our significant portfolio of fixed-rate single-family home loans, which are longer-term in nature than the customer accounts and borrowed money that constitute our liabilities. 
 
 We are currently anticipating that there will be further decreases in the target federal funds rate in 2025 but the inflationary outlook remains uncertain. However, if interest rates do not decrease, or if the Federal Reserve were to rapidly increase the target federal funds rate, the increase in rates could continue to constrain our interest rate spread and may adversely affect our business forecasts. On the other hand, decreases in interest rates, may result in a change in the mix of noninterest and interest-bearing accounts. We are unable to predict changes in interest rates, which are affected by factors beyond our control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and other changes in financial markets. 
 
 We are exposed to risks related to fraud and cyber-attacks. 
 23 

Cybersecurity, and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes, and practices designed to protect customer information, systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Company. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance, modify, and refine our protective measures against these evolving threats. 
 
 We are continuously enhancing and expanding our digital products and services to meet customer and business needs with desired outcomes. These digital products and services often include storing, transmitting, and processing confidential customer, employee, financial, and business information. Due to the nature of this information, and the value it has for internal and external threat actors, we, and our third-party service providers, continue to be subject to cyber-attacks and fraud activity that attempts to gain unauthorized access, misuse information and information systems, steal information, disrupt or degrade information systems, spread malicious software, and other illegal activities. 
 
 We believe we have robust preventive, detective, and administrative safeguards and security controls to minimize the probability and magnitude of a material event. However, if we are unable to maintain them, we may fall victim to a material adverse cybersecurity event. Because the tactics and techniques used by threat actors to bypass safeguards and security controls change frequently, and often are not recognized until after an event has occurred, we may be unable to anticipate future tactics and techniques, or to implement adequate and timely protective measures. 
 
 We are subject to additional risk with respect to third-party vendors that process or handle personal and financial data of our customers, partners, suppliers or employees. These third-party vendors may themselves use other vendors to store or process our data, which further elevates our risk exposure. Our third-party vendors have been, and may in the future be, subject to security incidents, including those caused by computer viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing attempts, social engineering, hacking or other means of unauthorized access. Control failures of security measures managed by our third-party service providers could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation and could require us to incur substantial expenses, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 To date, we have no knowledge of a material cyber-attack or other material information security incident affecting the systems we operate and control. However, our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the continuation of a remote or hybrid work environment for our employees and service providers, and our plans to continue to implement and expand digital banking services, expand operations, and use third-party information systems that includes cloud-based infrastructure, platforms, and software. Recent instances of attacks specifically targeting banks and financial services businesses indicate that the risk to our systems remains significant. We, and our third-party providers, are regularly the subject of attempted attacks and the ability of the attackers and the method of their attacks continues to grow in sophistication. Threat actors, including nation state attackers, could also use artificial intelligence for malicious purposes, increasing the frequency and complexity of their attacks. Potential threats to our technologies, systems, networks, and other devices, as well as those of our employees, third party vendors, and other third parties with whom we interact, include Distributed Denial of Service ("DDoS") attacks, computer viruses, hacking, malware, ransomware, credential stuffing, phishing, and other forms of social engineering. Such cyber-attacks and other security incidents are designed to lead to various harmful outcomes, such as unauthorized transactions against our customers accounts, unauthorized or unintended access to confidential information, or the release, gathering, monitoring, disclosure, loss, destruction, corruption, disablement, encryption, misuse, modification or other processing of confidential or sensitive information (including personal information), intellectual property, software, methodologies or business secrets, disruption, sabotage or degradation of service, systems or networks, or other damage. These threats may derive from, among other things, error, fraud or malice on the part of our employees, insiders, or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure. Any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, service providers, customers, partners or other third-party users of our systems or networks to disclose confidential or sensitive information (including personal information) in order to gain access to our systems, networks or data or that of our customers, partners, or third parties with whom we interact, or to unlawfully obtain monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. A cyber-attack or other security incident on the systems we operate and control could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation, result in productivity losses, require us to incur substantial expenses, including response costs associated with investigation and resumption of services, remediation expenses costs associated with customer notification and credit monitoring services, increased insurance premiums, regulatory penalties and fines, and costs associated with civil litigation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 We also face additional costs when our customers become the victims of cyber-attacks. For example, various retailers have reported that they have been the victims of a cyber-attack in which large amounts of their customers data, including debit and credit card information, is obtained. Our customers may be the victims of phishing scams, providing cyber criminals access to their accounts, or credit or debit card information. In these situations, we incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers, as well as potential increases to insurance premiums for policies we may maintain to cover these losses. 
 
 24 

Both internal and external fraud and theft are risks. If confidential customer, employee, monetary, or business information were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or if such information were to be intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties, or if our own employees abused their access to financial systems to commit fraud against our customers and the Company. These activities can occur in connection with activities such as the origination of loans and lines of credit, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, and checking transactions, and result in financial losses as well as reputational damage. 
 
 Operational errors can include information system misconfiguration, clerical or record-keeping errors, or disruptions from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors, which may be automated or manual, may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Because of the Company s large transaction volume and its necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process these transactions, there is a risk that technical flaws, tampering, or manipulation of those automated systems, arising from events wholly or partially beyond its control, may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. 
 
 The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability for us to operate our business, additional costs to correct defects, potential liability to clients, reputational damage, and regulatory intervention, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Inflationary pressures and rising prices may affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Inflation rates moved closer to the FRB s target rate in 2024, but remained somewhat elevated and as of September 2024, above the FRB s target of 2 . The inflation experienced in 2022 and 2023 has led to increased costs to our customers, making it more difficult for them to repay their loans or other obligations increasing our credit risk. The inflationary outlook in the United States is currently uncertain. If inflationary pressures do not subside, sustained higher interest rates by the Federal Reserve may be needed to tame persistent inflationary price pressures, which could push down asset prices and weaken economic activity. A deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and our markets could result in a further increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services, all of which, in turn, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Integrating Luther Burbank with the Company may prove more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized. 
 
 On March 1, 2024, the Company closed the Merger with Luther Burbank. The Merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently and with different business models. The ultimate success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of WaFd and Luther Burbank. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the Merger, we must successfully integrate Luther Burbank s operations with ours in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized, without adversely affecting current revenues and future growth. If the integration is more costly than projected, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. While we have realized 45 in annualized cost-savings due to the merger as of September 30, 2024, exceeding the original 25 target, an inability to maintain the full extent of these cost savings following the Merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of our Common Stock. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect the companies ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors, and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. Integration efforts between the companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the Merger. 

Current uncertain economic conditions pose challenges, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The pandemic caused a global economic slowdown, and while we have seen some economic recovery, continuing supply chain issues, labor shortages and inflation risks continue to affect the economic recovery. U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of additional credit-rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the United States. There remain increased risks of a government shutdown if the spending bills necessary to fund the government through the fiscal year that ends September 30, 2025 are not 
 25 

passed by Congress. Future deterioration in the U.S. credit and financial markets could result in losses or significant deterioration in the fair value of our U.S. government issued, sponsored or guaranteed investments. At September 30, 2024, we had 2.2 billion invested in U.S. government and agency obligations, and further downgrades could affect the stability of securities issued or guaranteed by the federal government and the valuation or liquidity of our portfolio of such investment securities. 
 
 Economic uncertainty, or a recessionary or stagnant economy, could result in financial stress on the Bank's borrowers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Deteriorating conditions in the regional economies we serve, or in certain sectors of those economies, in excess of the reasonable and supportable forecasts we used to estimate credit losses, could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses. We could also face the following risks in connection with the following events: 
 
 Market developments and economic stagnation or slowdown may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities. 
 The processes we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses and other reserves may prove to be unreliable. Such estimates rely upon complex modeling inputs and judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which may be rendered inaccurate and/or no longer subject to accurate forecasting. 
 Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite loans become less predictive of future charge-offs. 
 Regulatory scrutiny of the industry could increase, leading to increased regulation of the industry that could lead to a higher cost of compliance, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and increase our exposure to litigation or fines. 
 Ineffective monetary policy or other market conditions could cause rapid changes in interest rates and asset values that would have a materially adverse impact on our profitability and overall financial condition. 
 Further erosion in the fiscal condition of the U.S. Treasury could lead to new taxes that would limit our ability to pursue growth and return profits to shareholders. 
 
 If these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition. 
 
 Changes to monetary policy by the Federal Reserve could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 
 The Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating the supply of money in the United States, including open market operations used to stabilize prices in times of economic stress, as well as setting monetary policies. These activities strongly influence our rate of return on certain investments, our hedge effectiveness for mortgage servicing and our mortgage origination pipeline, as well as our costs of funds for lending and investing, all of which may adversely impact our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and capital position. 
 
 Unstable global economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, and operations. 
 
 The global credit and financial markets have from time-to-time experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, high rates of inflation, and uncertainty about economic stability. Changes in trade policies by the United States or other countries, such as tariffs or retaliatory tariffs, may cause inflation which could impact the prices of products sold by our borrowers and have the potential to reduce demand for their products impacting their profitability and making it difficult for our borrowers to repay their loans. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the evolving conflict in the Middle East. These events have increased and are expected to continue to increase volatility in commodity and energy prices, including oil, and continuing hostilities raise the possibility of supply disruptions. Rising tensions and global instability have the potential to affect consumer confidence in the U.S. and abroad, therefore having a broader effect on financial markets. Changes in trade policies or sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflict could further adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected countries or others could exacerbate market and economic instability. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment, hostile third-party action or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions.

Our allowance for credit losses ("ACL") may not be adequate to cover future loan losses, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If our customers are unable to repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance, we will be required to characterize the loan as non-performing or write it off as a loss. We maintain an ACL to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, however, losses may exceed the value of the collateral securing the loans and the allowance may not fully cover any excess loss. 
 
 We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. Our ACL is based on these judgments, as well as historical loss experience and an evaluation of the other risks associated with our loan portfolio, including but not limited to, economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, management, competition, and trends in delinquencies, non-accrual and adversely classified loans, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio. Banking regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, review our loans and ACL. If our assumptions and judgments used to determine the ACL prove to be incorrect, if the value of the collateral securing the loans decreases substantially or if regulators disagree with our judgments, we may need to increase the ACL in amounts that exceed our expectations. Material additions to the ACL, or losses in excess of the ACL, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We are exposed to risks related to our operational, technological, and third-party provided technology infrastructure. 
 
 We rely extensively on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of information technology and telecommunications systems to conduct our business. This includes internally developed systems, internally managed systems, outsourced systems provided by third-party service providers, internet facing digital products and services, mobile technologies and the on-going operational maintenance of each service. Any disruptions, failures, or inaccuracies of these systems, including changes and improvements, could result in our inability to service customers, manage operations, manage risk, meet regulatory obligations, or provide timely and accurate financial reporting which could damage our reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject us to regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. 
 
 In many instances, the Company s products and services to customers are dependent upon third-party service providers, who provide necessary, or critical, services and support. Any disruption of such services, or an unplanned termination of a third-party license or service agreement related thereto, could adversely affect our ability to provide necessary products and services for our customers. 
 
 In recent years, we have made a significant ongoing investment to enhance our technological capabilities with the objectives of enhancing customer experience, growing revenue, and improving operating efficiency. There is a risk that these investments may not provide the anticipated benefits and/or will prove significantly more costly and time consuming to produce. If this occurs, we may see a loss of customers, and our financial results and ability to execute on our strategic plan may be adversely impacted. 
 
 We are subject to complex state and federal laws, rules, regulations and standards regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which impact how we conduct our business. 
 
 We are subject to complex and evolving data privacy laws, rules, regulations, standards and contractual obligations (collectively data privacy laws that relate to the privacy and security of the personal information of customers, employees or others. These data privacy laws require, among other things, that we make certain privacy disclosures, maintain a robust security program, require disclosures and notifications during a cyber or information security incident, and regulate our collection, use, sharing, retention, and safeguarding of consumer or employee information. State and federal regulators may also hold us responsible for privacy and data protection obligations performed by our third-party service providers while providing services to us, as well as disclosures and notifications during a cyber or information security incident. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. 
 
 State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and provide detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which the Company operates. As the regulatory environment becomes more rigorous, we anticipate that compliance with these requirements will result in additional costs and expenses, and may impact the way we conduct business. Our failure to comply with data privacy laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations, litigation, fines, or 
 27 

sanctions, or cause damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 The development and use of Artificial Intelligence AI presents risks and challenges that may adversely impact our business. 
 
 We or our third-party (or fourth party) vendors, clients or counterparties may develop or incorporate AI technology in certain business processes, services, or products. The development and use of AI presents a number of risks and challenges to our business. The legal and regulatory environment relating to AI is uncertain and rapidly evolving, both in the U.S. and internationally, and includes regulatory schemes targeted specifically at AI as well as provisions in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment, and other laws applicable to the use of AI. These evolving laws and regulations could require changes in our implementation of AI technology and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that reflects biases included in the data on which they are trained, that results in the release of private, confidential, or proprietary information, that infringes on the intellectual property rights of others, or that is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it difficult to understand why they are generating particular outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring the capabilities of the AI models, reducing erroneous output, eliminating bias, and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train their models, including risks arising from the inclusion of any unauthorized material in the training data for their models and the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated with the output of their models, matters over which we may have limited visibility. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures. 
 
 If we are not able to retain or attract key employees, or if we were to suffer the loss of a significant number of employees, we could experience a disruption in our business. 
 
 If a key employee or a substantial number of employees depart or become unable to perform their duties, it may negatively impact our ability to conduct business as usual. Unanticipated departures, including in connection with acquisition activity, such as our recent acquisition of Luther Burbank, might require us to divert resources from other areas of our operations, which could create additional stress for other employees, including those in key positions. The loss of qualified and key personnel, or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business and consequently impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and losses to us. 
 
 Our risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies designed to manage the types of risks to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, cybersecurity and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Because we rely on assumptions and judgment calls, our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk of loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our financial condition, operations or business prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences. 
 
 Climate change could adversely affect our business, affect client activity levels and damage our reputation. 
 
 Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses are also changing their behavior and business preferences as a result of these concerns. New governmental regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as changes in consumers and businesses behaviors and business preferences, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we will engage in certain activities or offer certain products or services. The governmental and supervisory focus on climate change could also result in our becoming subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements. In connection with the transition to a low carbon economy, legislative or public policy changes and changes in consumer sentiment could negatively impact the businesses and financial condition of our clients, which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients. Our business, reputation and ability to attract and retain employees may also be harmed if our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient. 
 
 28 

Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change have and will continue to have a negative impact on our business, as well as on our customers and their business. Physical risks include extreme storms, tsunamis, floods, wildfires or other catastrophic events that damage or destroy offices or other assets, or that damage or destroy property and inventory securing loans we make. These catastrophic events may also interrupt our customer s business operations, putting them in financial difficulty, and increasing the risk of default. Our customers are also facing increases in energy, insurance and commodity costs driven by climate change, as well as new regulatory requirements resulting in increased operational costs. 
 
 A pandemic or similar health crisis, may adversely affect our business and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers in the future. 
 
 The spread of COVID-19 created a global public-health crisis that resulted in significant economic uncertainty, and impacted household, business, economic, and market conditions across the world, including in the western United States where we conduct nearly all of our business. 
 
 Throughout the pandemic our operations were impacted by the need to close certain offices and limit how customers conduct business through our branch network. Many of our employees continue to work remotely, which exposes us to increased cybersecurity risks such as phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, all of which could expose us to liability and could seriously disrupt our business operations. 
 
 A similar pandemic or major health crisis could negatively impact our capital, liquidity, and other financial positions and our business, results of operations, and prospects, affect significantly more households and businesses, or cause additional limitations on commercial activity, increased unemployment, increased property vacancy rates and general economic and financial instability. A slow-down or reversal in the economic recovery of the regions in which we conduct our business could result in declines in loan demand and collateral values. Negative impacts on our customers caused by a pandemic or other major health crisis could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans. Future actions of governmental authorities taken in response to a pandemic or similar crisis, such as eviction forbearance, occupancy restrictions, vaccine mandates, or suspension of mortgage foreclosures, could have a negative impact on our business. 
 
 Regulatory and Litigation Risks 
 
 Non-Compliance with banking rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair Lending Laws, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Flood Insurance Reform Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, and curtail our expansion opportunities. 
 
 Financial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act and Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Our failure or our inability to comply with the Patriot Act and BSA statutes and regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, enforcement actions, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. 
 
 The Bank was previously subject to a Consent Order from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC for its BSA program that was issued in February 2018 (the BSA Consent Order ). The BSA Consent Order resulted in the Bank incurring significant expenses to implement an effective AML/CFT Program, including payment of a 2,500,000 civil money penalty. The OCC terminated the BSA Consent Order in December 2021. However, the Bank remains subject to the BSA, the Patriot Act, and other laws and regulations requiring financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. Expanded laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities could create significant new compliance burdens and financial costs. Failure to maintain an effective AML/CFT program could have serious business, financial and reputational consequences for the Bank. 
 
 The Community Reinvestment Act CRA ), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment requirements and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The FDIC, CFPB, the United States Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to our performance under the CRA, receiving a less than satisfactory CRA rating, or challenges related to other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages, civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity, and restrictions on expansion activity, including opening new branches or entering new lines of business. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution s performance under fair lending laws in private 
 29 

class action litigation. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Failure to comply with the 2020 and 2013 Consent Orders from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding our Home Mortgage Disclosure Act submissions could result in additional regulatory enforcement action. 
 
 In March 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB Office of Enforcement formally notified us of alleged violations of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act HMDA associated with our HMDA reporting submissions. The CFPB alleged that the Bank did not accurately report all required relevant information within the annual HMDA submissions. We responded to the CFPB, noting that the Bank has instituted enhanced procedures to ensure compliance with HMDA, and submitted amended HMDA filings. In October 2020, after further discussions with the CFPB, we entered into a consent order related to our HMDA reporting, under which we agreed to pay a 200,000 civil money penalty and implement a HMDA compliance management system while adhering to a compliance plan. The consent order will be in effect for 10 years. We had previously entered into a consent order with the CFPB in 2013, also relating to HMDA reporting deficiencies, resulting in a 34,000 civil money penalty. The 2013 HMDA consent order remains in effect. Any further deficiencies in our HMDA reporting submissions could result in additional regulatory enforcement actions, cause us to incur additional significant compliance costs and subject us to larger fines. Moreover, continued deficiencies in our HMDA reporting could have serious reputational consequences for the Bank. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We operate in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of our business activities. 
 
 We are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the WDFI, the FDIC and the CFPB. In addition, the Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating the holding company. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit our shareholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including laws and regulations governing consumer credit, CRA, and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws), but also capital adequacy, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, data reporting and various other factors. As part of this regulatory structure, we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Under this structure the WDFI, the FDIC, the CFPB and the Federal Reserve have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine, among other things, that our operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations. In particular, the FDIC has specific authority to take prompt corrective action, if the Bank s capital falls below its current well capitalized level, including limiting the Bank s ability to take brokered deposits, requiring the Bank to raise additional capital and subject it to progressively more severe restrictions on its operations, management and capital distributions, and replacement of senior executive officers and directors. If the Bank ever became critically undercapitalized, it would also be subject to the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 
 
 Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders; prior-identified deficiencies in our HMDA reporting and AML/CFT programs have resulted in Consent Orders from the CFPB and OCC, required us to incur significant expenses and compliance costs and subjected us to civil penalties. Failure to meet regulatory requirements could require the Bank to incur additional significant costs in order to bring our programs and operations into compliance, negatively impact our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Recent national and state legislation and regulatory initiatives to support the financial services industry have been coupled with numerous restrictions and requirements that could detrimentally affect our business. 
 
 The Dodd-Frank Act has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry since its passage in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a framework through which regulatory reform has been and continues to be written. While many of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented, others are still being drafted. As a result, the impact of the future regulatory requirements continue to be uncertain. We expect the way we conduct business to continue to be affected by these regulatory requirements, including through limitations on our ability to pursue certain lines of business, capital requirements, enhanced reporting obligations, and increased costs. 
 
 30 

The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank are expected to result in modifications to or additional laws and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies, including increasing capital requirements, modifications to regulatory requirements with respect to liquidity risk management, deposit concentrations, capital adequacy, stress testing and contingency planning, and safe and sound banking practices, or enhanced supervisory or enforcement activities. Other legislative initiatives could detrimentally impact our operations in the future. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws, promulgate new regulations or view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past, or commence investigations or inquiries into our business practices. For example, the Biden Administration announced a government-wide effort to eliminate junk fees which could subject our business practices to even further scrutiny. The CFPB s action on junk fees thus far has largely focused on fees associated with deposit products, such as surprise overdraft fees and non-sufficient funds fees. However, what constitutes a junk fee remains undefined. The CFPB is actively soliciting consumer input on fee practices associated with other consumer financial products or services, signaling that the junk fee initiative is likely to continue to broaden in scope. As a result of this regulatory focus, we have changed how we assess overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees and we may be required to implement additional changes based on regulatory directives or guidance. Such changes have led to and may continue to cause a reduction in our non-interest income thus impacting our overall net income. 
 
 The extent of the impact of any future legislation will be dependent on the specific details of the final legislation passed, if any, but the potential changes outlined above could, among other things, increase our costs, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and the types of financial services and products we may offer, and impact future growth, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Deposit insurance premiums could increase further in the future. 
 
 The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") at a specific level. Historically, unfavorable economic conditions increased bank failures and these additional bank failures decreased the DIF. Extraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of 2020 caused the ratio of the DIF to total insured deposits to fall below the current statutory minimum of 1.35 . In order to restore the DIF to its statutorily mandated minimums, the FDIC significantly increased deposit insurance premium rates, including the Bank's, resulting in increased expenses. The revised assessment rate schedules became effective January 1, 2023, and were applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of 2023 (i.e., January 1 through March 31, 2023, with an invoice payment date of June 30, 2023). In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to impose a special assessment to recover the losses to the deposit insurance fund resulting from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Beginning in the first calendar quarter of 2024, the FDIC began collecting the special assessment and it is expected to continue collecting the special assessment for a total of eight quarters. The FDIC may further increase the assessment rates or impose additional special assessments in the future to restore and then steadily increase the DIF. FDIC insurance premiums could increase in the future in response to similar declining economic conditions. A material increase in the Bank's FDIC premiums could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to various claims and litigation, which could result in significant expenses, losses and damage to our reputation. 
 
 We are, from time to time, subject to claims and proceedings related to our operations. These claims and legal actions could include supervisory or enforcement actions by our regulators, criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities, or civil claims by our customers, former customers, contractual counterparties, and current and former employees. We may also face class action lawsuits for, among other things, alleged violations of employment, state wage and hour and consumer protection laws. These claims could involve large monetary demands, including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities, and significant defense costs. If such claims and legal actions are brought, and are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they could result in financial liability and/or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Banking institutions are also increasingly the target of class action lawsuits, including claims alleging deceptive practices or violations of account terms in connection with non-sufficient funds or overdraft charges and violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA ). In 2022, the Bank paid 495,000 plus claims administrative expenses to settle a class action lawsuit related to allegations of improper assessments of overdraft and insufficient funds fees. In May 2024, we received court approval for the settlement of a class action claim related to alleged violations of the FLSA associated with claims for allegedly unpaid wages and overtime for certain of our non-exempt employees under which the Bank ultimately paid approximately 2.1 million. If another class action lawsuit is filed or determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement agreement in connection with such a matter, we could be exposed to monetary damages, reputational harm, or subject to limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, and operating results. 
 
 31 

Our real estate lending also exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities. 
 
 In the course of our business, it is necessary to foreclose and take title to real estate, which could subject us to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. Hazardous substances or waste, contaminants, pollutants or sources thereof may be discovered on properties during our ownership or after a sale to a third party. We could be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at such properties. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial and could substantially exceed the value of the real property. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. We may be unable to recover costs from any third party. These occurrences may materially reduce the value of the affected property, and we may find it difficult or impossible to use or sell the property prior to or following any environmental remediation. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Market and Industry Risks 
 
 Recent negative developments affecting the banking industry, and resulting media coverage, have eroded customer confidence in the banking system. 
 
 The high-profile bank failures of 2023 generated significant market volatility among publicly traded bank holding companies and, in particular, regional banks like the Company. These market developments also negatively impacted customer confidence in the safety and soundness of regional banks. While the Department of the Treasury, the FRB, and the FDIC took steps to ensure that depositors of the failed banks would have access to their deposits, including uninsured deposit accounts, there is no guarantee that such actions will be successful in restoring customer confidence in regional banks and the banking system more broadly. If other bank failures occur and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future due to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, it could disrupt the financial services industry and customers may choose to maintain deposits with larger financial institutions or invest in higher yielding short-term fixed income securities, all of which could materially adversely impact the Company s liquidity, loan funding capacity, net interest margin, capital and results of operations. 
 
 As a result of the bank failures, the FDIC imposed a special assessment to recoup losses to the deposit fund. If additional bank failures were to occur, we could face increased regulation of our industry, including increased compliance costs and limitations on our ability to pursue business opportunities; significantly higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums or additional special assessments; adverse impacts on our stock price and volatility of our Common Stock; and increased competition for deposits due to a lack of consumer confidence in regional banks. If these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition. 
 
 A downturn in the real estate market would hurt our business. 
 
 The Bank s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in real estate lending, in particular commercial real estate loans which are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or certain other types of loans or investments. The market for real estate is cyclical and the outlook for this sector is uncertain. A downturn in the real estate market, accompanied by falling values and increased foreclosures would hurt our business because a large majority of our loans are secured by real estate. 
 
 If a significant decline in market values occurs, the collateral for loans will provide decreasing levels of security. As a result, our ability to recover the principal amount due on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished, and we will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. Because our loan portfolio contains commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of these loans may cause a significant increase in our nonperforming loans which could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, any of which would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 We own real estate as a result of foreclosures resulting from non-performing loans. If other lenders or borrowers liquidate significant amounts of real estate in a rapid or disorderly fashion, or if the FDIC elects to dispose of significant amounts of real estate from failed financial institutions in a similar fashion, it could have an adverse effect on the values of the properties owned by the Company by depressing the value of these real estate holdings. In such a case, we may incur further write-downs and charge-offs, which could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 32 

Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We have significant investments in bank premises and equipment for our branch network as well as our retail work force and other branch banking assets. Advances in technology, as well as changing customer preferences for accessing our products and services, are requiring us to change our retail distribution strategy. As a result of the current market environment and customer behavior, we have undertaken a branch optimization strategy that has led to the closure, consolidation or sale of certain branches in our network. These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of other long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure remaining branches or to otherwise further reform our retail distribution channel. In addition, any changes in our branch network strategy could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operations if it results in the loss of customers or deposits which we rely on as a low cost and stable source of funds for our loans and operations. 
 
 We may suffer losses in our loan portfolio due to inadequate or faulty underwriting and loan collection practices. 
 
 There are risks inherent in any loan portfolio, which we attempt to address by adhering to specific underwriting and loan collection practices. Underwriting practices often include analysis of a borrower's prior credit history; financial statements; tax returns; cash flow projections; valuation of collateral; personal guarantees of loans to businesses; and verification of liquid assets. If the underwriting process fails to capture accurate information or proves to be inadequate, we may incur losses on loans that appeared to meet our underwriting criteria, and those losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in the allowance for credit losses. Loan collection resources may be expanded to meet increases in nonperforming loans resulting from economic downturns or to service any loans acquired, resulting in higher loan administration costs. We are also exposed to the risk of improper documentation of foreclosure proceedings that would also increase the cost of collection. 
 
 Our operations are focused in the western United States, subjecting us to the risks of general economic conditions in these market areas. 
 
 Substantially all of the Bank's loans are to individuals, businesses and real estate developers in the Pacific Northwest, California, Arizona, Utah, Texas, New Mexico and Nevada. As a result, our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in these market areas. A substantial increase in unemployment rates, or severe declines in housing prices and property values in any of these primary market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business due to a number of factors, including: 
 
 Loan delinquencies may increase. 
 Problem assets and foreclosures may increase. 
 Demand for the Bank's products and services may decline. 
 Collateral for loans made by the Bank, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer's borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with the loans. 
 Natural disasters and catastrophic events such as wildfires, floods and earthquakes may damage or destroy collateral for loans made by the Bank and negatively impact the collateral s value and a customer s ability to repay loans. 
 
 Our liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising from certain industry deficiencies in foreclosure practices, including delays and challenges in the foreclosure process. 
 
 Foreclosure process issues and the potential legal and regulatory responses to them could negatively impact the process and timing to completion of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders, including the Bank. During the COVID-19 pandemic, certain states in which we do business enacted temporary stays on evictions and foreclosures, or instituted a right to forbearance for homeowners experiencing financial hardship. Even before the adoption of these emergency policies, foreclosure timelines have increased in recent years due to, among other reasons, delays associated with the significant increase in the number of foreclosure cases as a result of economic downturns, additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process and voluntary or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. Should these stays or rights to forbearance be enacted again, or if new legislation is passed regarding residential foreclosures, we may be limited in our ability to take timely possession of real estate assets collateralizing loans, which may increase our loan losses. Increases in the foreclosure timeline could also result in increased costs, and may have an adverse effect on collateral values and our ability to minimize our losses. 
 
 Impairment of goodwill may adversely impact future results of operations. 
 
 Accounting standards require that we account for acquisitions using a method that could result in goodwill. If the purchase price of the acquired company exceeds the fair value of the acquired net assets, the excess will be included in the 
 33 

Company's Statement of Financial Condition as goodwill. The Company has a significant goodwill balance and, in accordance with GAAP, we evaluate it for impairment at least annually and more often if events or circumstances indicate the possibility of impairment. Evaluations may be based on many factors, some of which are the price of our Common Stock, discounted cash flow projections and data from comparable market acquisitions. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in impairment of our goodwill. Future evaluations of goodwill may result in the impairment and write-down of our goodwill balance which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and adversely affect our operating results. 
 
 Competitive Risks 
 
 The Bank faces strong competition from other financial institutions and new market participants, offering services similar to those offered by the Bank. 
 
 Many competitors, including fintech companies, offer the same types of loan and deposit services that the Company offers. These competitors include national and multinational banks, other regional banks, savings associations, community banks, credit unions, fintechs, and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include national banks and major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations, launch new technologies and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with our increased dependency on technology. Additionally, recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible for other non-traditional competitors to enter the marketplace and compete for traditional banking services. Increased competition within our geographic market area may result in reduced loan originations and deposits. Ultimately, competition from current and future competitors may affect our business materially and adversely. 
 
 We may not be able to continue to grow organically or through acquisitions. 
 
 Historically, we have expanded through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. If market and regulatory conditions change, we may be unable to grow organically or successfully compete for, complete, and integrate potential future acquisitions at the same pace as we have achieved in recent years, or at all. We have historically used our strong stock currency and capital resources to complete acquisitions. Downturns in the stock market and the market price of our stock, changes in our capital position, and changes in our regulatory standing could each have a negative impact on our ability to complete future acquisitions. 
 
 Our entry into California may present increased risk that may adversely impact our business, prospects and financial condition. 
 
 The Merger with Luther Burbank resulted in the Bank s initial entry into the state of California. We have no operating experience in California, are new to this market area, and will be relying on the experience and expertise of Luther Burbank s lending and business development officers to help with our transition. We may be unsuccessful in retaining those existing employees. The banking and financial services business in California is highly competitive. The entry of the Bank into California presents us with different competitive conditions, and we will be required to compete for loans, deposits and customers for financial services with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions, fintechs, and other nonbank financial service providers in California. Many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader array of financial services than the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in California, and if we are unable to compete effectively in California, the benefits we were anticipating from the Merger may not be fully achieved, and our results of operations and financial conditions could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Security Ownership Risks 
 
 Our ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations that may affect our ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders. 
 34 

The Company is a separate legal entity from the bank subsidiary and does not have significant operations of its own. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by the Bank's earnings and capital, as well as various federal and state statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank may not be able to pay dividends to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, then we may not be able to pay dividends on our preferred or Common Stock to our shareholders. If the Bank's earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, then our liquidity may be affected and our stock price may be negatively affected by our inability to pay dividends, which will have an adverse impact on both the Company and our shareholders. 
 
 Our 4.875 Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our Common Stock, and we are prohibited from paying dividends on our Common Stock unless we have paid dividends on our Series A Preferred. 
 
 Shares of our Series A Preferred Stock rank senior to our Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee of our Board of Directors), out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Washington law, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock at a rate equal to 4.875 per annum for each quarterly dividend period, beginning on April 15, 2021. If we do not or are unable to pay quarterly dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, we may not pay a dividend to the holders of our Common Stock. Our stock price may be negatively affected by our inability to pay dividends, which will have an adverse impact on both the Company and our shareholders. 
 
 In addition, if we fail to pay, or declare and set apart for payment, dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors on our Board of Directors will automatically be increased by two, and the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to elect two additional members of our Board of Directors (the Preferred Stock Directors to fill such newly created directorships. 
 
 The market price for our Common Stock may be volatile. 
 
 The market price of our Common Stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including those discussed below. The market price of our Common Stock has in the past fluctuated significantly, including in 2023 as a result of the high-profile bank failures. We expect to see additional volatility in the financial markets due to the uncertainty caused by the continuing global conflicts, commodity shortages and price fluctuations, recent bank failures, uncertainty over the U.S. government debt ceiling, risks of government shutdowns and changing Federal Reserve policy. Some additional factors that may cause the price of our Common Stock to fluctuate include: 
 
 general conditions in the financial markets and real estate markets. 
 bank failures and the regulatory response. 
 macro-economic and political conditions in the U. S. and the financial markets generally. 
 variations in the operating results of the Company and our competitors. 
 events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to the Company. 
 changes in securities analysts' estimates of our future performance and the future performance of our competitors. 
 announcements by the Company or our competitors of mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships. 
 additions or departure of key personnel. 
 the presence or absence of short selling of the Company's Common Stock. 
 future sales by us of our Common Stock or debt securities. 
 
 The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations. These fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations are expected to continue for the near future, and may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock. 
 
 There may be future sales or other dilution of the Company's equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock or depositary shares. 
 
 Our Board of Directors is authorized to cause the Company to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock junior to our Series A Preferred Stock from time to time without any action on the part of our shareholders, and our Board of Directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that 
 35 

may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over the Common Stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding up and liquidation and other terms. 
 
 The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to existing shareholders. As we did for the Merger with Luther Burbank, we may also elect to use Common Stock to fund new acquisitions, which will further dilute existing shareholders. Holders of our Common Stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders. 
 
 We rely, in part, on external financing to fund our operations and the unavailability of such funding in the future could adversely impact our growth and prospects. 
 
 We rely on customer deposits, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings to fund our operations. Management has historically been able to replace maturing deposits, if desired; however, we may not be able to replace such funds at any given point in time if our financial condition or market conditions change or if the cost of doing so might adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If we need additional funds for our liquidity needs, we may seek additional debt to achieve our long-term business objectives. Such borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be on favorable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 A person holding our Common Stock could have the voting power of their shares of Common Stock on all matters significantly reduced under Washington's anti-takeover statutes, if the person acquires 10 or more of the voting stock of the Company. 
 
 We are incorporated in the state of Washington and subject to Washington state law. Some provisions of Washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change-in-control events affecting us. For example, Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, with limited exceptions, prohibits a target corporation from engaging in specified significant business transactions for a period of five years after the share acquisition by an acquiring person, without complying with certain shareholder approval requirements. An acquiring person is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially own 10 or more of our voting securities. Such prohibited transactions include, among other things: 
 
 certain mergers, or consolidations with, disposition of assets to, or issuances of stock to or redemption of stock from, the acquiring person; 
 termination of 5 or more of the employees of the target corporation as a result of the acquiring person's acquisition of 10 or more of the shares; 
 allowing the acquiring person to receive any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder; and 
 liquidating or dissolving the target corporation. 
 
 After the five-year period, certain significant business transactions are permitted, if they comply with certain fair price provisions of the statute or are approved by a majority of the outstanding shares other than those of which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership. As a Washington corporation, the Company is not permitted to opt out of this statute. 
 
 The Company s business or the value of its common shares could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist shareholders. 
 
 The Company values constructive input from shareholders, and our Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of the Company s shareholders. Activist shareholders who disagree with the composition of the Board of Directors, the Company s strategic direction, or the way the Company is managed may seek to effect change through various strategies that range from private engagement to public filings, proxy contests, efforts to force transactions not supported by the Board of Directors, and litigation. Responding to some of these actions can be costly and time-consuming, may disrupt the Company s operations and divert the attention of the Board of Directors and management. Such activities could interfere with the Company s ability to execute its strategic plan and to attract and retain qualified executive leadership. The perceived uncertainty as to the Company s future direction resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of the Company s common shares.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 
 Cybersecurity risk management and strategy 
 
 We recognize the value of personal and financial information and are dedicated to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data and systems. From the Board of Directors to our Customer Service Representatives, all individuals at the organization are responsible for handling confidential data with care. 
 
 Our Information Security Program is aligned with applicable federal and state regulations, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Examination Guidance, and industry-accepted security standards such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, which are at the forefront of cybersecurity guidelines for federal agencies in the U.S. We employ a defense in depth strategy that incorporates preventive, detective, and administrative safeguards including, but not limited to, advanced anti-malware and firewall technologies, anti-phishing and web filtering controls, robust patch management and vulnerability management processes, configuration hardening, participation with FS-ISAC (Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center) for sharing and consuming threat information, and we perform regular security testing to evaluate our defenses against real-world threats. We have an extensive information security training program that aims to regularly educate our colleagues on current best practices on handling sensitive information and expectations for protecting the organization and our clients. All employees complete mandatory cybersecurity training on at least a quarterly basis, including how to identify phishing attacks. Colleagues are tested regularly with simulated social engineering attacks to ensure awareness and preparedness. As an additional risk mitigation measure, the Bank maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event that a material incident does occur. 
 
 The ability to mitigate cybersecurity risks is dependent upon an effective risk assessment process that identifies, measures, controls, and monitors material risks stemming from cybersecurity threats. These threats include any potential unauthorized activities occurring through the Company s information systems that could adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the Company s information systems or the data contained therein. The Company s Information Security Program includes a comprehensive information security risk assessment process that incorporates the following elements: 
 
 Identifying threats, measuring risk, defining information security requirements, and implementing controls to reduce risk. 
 Identifying reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats that may lead to unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of sensitive information or information systems. 
 Assessing the likelihood and potential damage posed by these threats, considering the degree of information sensitivity and the Company s operations, inclusive of substantive changes to people, processes and technology. 
 Aligning the Information Security Program with the Company s enterprise-wide risk management program, which identifies, measures, mitigates, and monitors risk. 
 Evaluating the adequacy of policies, procedures, information systems, and other arrangements designed to control identified risks. 
 Providing input for internal and external auditors and independent third-party engagements, including in relation to third party operated penetration tests. 
 Exercising risk oversight to conduct appropriate, risk-based due diligence and monitoring to understand risks associated with our third-party vendors and outsourced services. 
 
 The risk assessment process is designed to identify assets requiring risk reduction strategies and includes an evaluation of the key factors applicable to the operation. The Company conducts a variety of information security assessments throughout the year, both internally and through third-party specialists. We partner with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), under the Department of Homeland Security, to conduct regular vulnerability scanning against our public facing assets, and on a recurring basis we partner with outside firms to conduct thorough security assessments against our external and internal environment. Results of those assessments are further evaluated, and remediation activity is prioritized. 
 
 Our cybersecurity and IT teams prepare for and respond to cybersecurity attacks and incidents, including defending against unauthorized access to our systems, and crafting response plans intended to significantly reduce impacts on operations and customers. We understand that cyber threats are unwavering and evolving in this digital age, and because of that we continue to increase investments in people and technology to help us mature our practices and maintain confidence in our ability to safeguard our assets. While cybersecurity risks have the potential to materially affect the Company s business, 
 37 

financial condition, and results of operations, the Company does not believe that risks from cybersecurity threats or attacks, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. With regard to the possible impact of future cybersecurity threats or incidents, see Item 1A, Risk Factors . 
 
 Cybersecurity Governance 
 
 The Risk Management Committee ("RMC") and the Technology Committee of our Board of Directors oversee the company's approach to managing cybersecurity risks. On a quarterly basis, the Board committees receive a comprehensive update from management on our cybersecurity risk management strategy. This includes information on emerging threats, the company s cybersecurity posture, progress toward risk mitigation goals, significant cybersecurity incidents or developments, and the steps management has taken to address these risks. During these sessions, the Board committees typically review materials detailing current and potential risks, as well as the company s capacity to mitigate those risks. The committee also engages in discussions with our Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Information Officer about these matters. Additionally, Board committee members are encouraged to engage in ongoing, informal conversations with management regarding cybersecurity news and updates to our risk management and strategy initiatives. Material cybersecurity risks are also reviewed during Board discussions on key topics such as enterprise risk management, operational budgeting, business continuity planning, mergers and acquisitions, and brand management. Three individuals on the Board of Directors have deep technology expertise, while one of those individuals is responsible for leading cloud security at a Fortune 50 technology company. 
 
 Our cybersecurity risk management and strategy are overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer, who leads a team with decades of combined experience in information security management, cybersecurity strategy development, and the implementation of effective cybersecurity programs. The team holds a variety of relevant degrees and professional certifications. 
 
 These members of management are responsible for overseeing and monitoring the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents as part of their involvement in the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes, including the execution of our incident response plan.

Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 Common Stock 
 
 The Company s Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol WAFD. At September 30, 2024, the number of shareholders of record was 994. This figure does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of Common Stock because shares are frequently held in street name by securities dealers and others for the benefit of individual owners who may vote the shares. 
 
 Additional information about stock options and other equity compensation plans is included in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 
 
 The Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to bank regulatory requirements, including (but not limited to) the capital adequacy regulations and policies established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Board of Directors' dividend policy is to review our financial performance, capital adequacy, regulatory compliance and cash resources on a quarterly basis, and, if such review is favorable, to declare and pay a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders. 
 
 The Company s 4.875 Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred ), ranks senior to the Company s Common Stock with respect to payment of dividends, and dividends (if declared) accrue and are payable on the Series A Preferred a rate of 4.875 per annum, payable quarterly, in arrears. While the Series A Preferred is outstanding, unless the full dividend for the preceding quarterly period is paid in full, or declared and a sum set aside, no dividend may be declared or paid on the Company s Common Stock. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 The Company s stock repurchase program was publicly announced by the Board of Directors on February 3, 1995 and has no expiration date. Under this program, a total of 86,956,264 shares of the Company s Common Stock have been authorized for repurchase. The following table shows the share repurchases made for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 42 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts within the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical for understanding our historical and future performance. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of the matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. Management s determination of the amount of the ACL is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the credit risk we ascribe to individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on individually evaluated loans, significant reliance on historical loss rates on homogeneous portfolios, consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. 
 
 Going forward, the methodology used to calculate the ACL will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the allowance for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility in our reported earnings. 
 Business Combinations. The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Management utilizes prevailing valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values. This method often involves estimates based on third party valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
 Assets acquired and liabilities assumed from contingencies must also be recognized at fair value if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. Acquisition-related costs, including conversion and restructuring charges, are expensed as incurred. Fair values are subject to refinement over the measurement period, not to exceed one year after the closing date. 
 Management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgement. Changes in the assumptions utilized within these valuations, including downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets which could result in impairment losses affecting the Company's financial statements as a whole. 
 Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We have determined our goodwill balance is all related to a single reporting unit and perform an annual impairment assessment on August 31st, or sooner if an impairment indicator exists. We perform a quantitative impairment assessment and, upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 
 
 When performing the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using the market capitalization approach, based on quoted market prices of our securities, adjusted for the effect of a control premium. Based on the results of the annual quantitative evaluation for 2024, the fair value of our single reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value and did not result in impairment for the reporting unit. 
 
 The Company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value. While the Company believes the judgments and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test are reasonable, different assumptions or changes in general industry, market and macro-economic conditions could change the estimated fair values and, therefore, future impairment charges could be required, which could be material to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Select information regarding the ACL is under the "Allowance for Credit Losses" heading within this section below. For further details on the ACL, business combinations or goodwill, see Notes A, B , and E to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Change (In thousands) Allowance for credit losses: Commercial loans Multi-family 25,248 13,155 12,093 92 Commercial real estate 39,210 28,842 10,368 36 Commercial industrial 58,748 58,773 (25) Construction 22,267 29,408 (7,141) (24) Land - acquisition development 7,900 7,016 884 13 Total commercial loans 153,373 137,194 16,179 12 Consumer loans Single-family residential 40,523 28,029 12,494 45 Construction - custom 1,427 2,781 (1,354) (49) Land - consumer lot loans 2,564 3,512 (948) (27) HELOC 3,049 2,859 190 7 Consumer 2,817 2,832 (15) (1) Total consumer loans 50,380 40,013 10,367 26 Total allowance for loan losses 203,753 177,207 26,546 15 Reserve for unfunded commitments 21,500 24,500 (3,000) (12) Total allowance for credit losses 225,253 201,707 23,546 12 
 
 The allowance for loan losses increased by 26,546,000, or 14.98 , from 177,207,000 as of September 30, 2023, to 203,753,000 at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the allowance of 203,753,000 is for loans that are evaluated on a pooled basis, which was comprised of 144,848,000 related to the quantitative component and 58,905,000 related to management's qualitative overlays. The fluctuations that resulted in the overall increase from the prior year can be seen in the table above. The allowance for multi-family and single-family residential loans increased largely as a result of the Merger. The allowance for both consumer and commercial construction loans decreased as projects were completed and transitioned to CRE and single-family loans which also contributed to increases. 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 17,500,000 in 2024, compared to a provision of 41,500,000 for 2023. These amounts are net of provision and recapture related to the unfunded commitments reserve. In 2024, provisioning included the initial provision of 16,000,000 recorded on LBC loans acquired, as well as adjustments resulting from qualitative considerations such as prolonged and intensified borrower sensitivity to high interest rates and operating costs due to inflationary pressures. For the year ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs were 1,356,000, compared to charge-offs of 45,101,000 in the prior year. The ratio of the total ACL to total gross loans decreased to 1.01 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.03 as of September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily related to a shift in mix of loan types within the portfolio. Loan portfolios with lower historical losses, like multi-family and single family residential saw increased balances as a result of the Merger while those with higher historical losses, like construction, saw decreases. 
 The reserve for unfunded loan commitments was 21,500,000 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 24,500,000 as of September 30, 2023. 
 Management believes the total ACL is sufficient to absorb estimated losses inherent in the portfolio of loans and unfunded commitments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

ASSET QUALITY 
 
 Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty. Loans may be modified as the result of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty needing relief from the contractual terms of their loan. Most loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has approached the Bank about modification due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request for modification is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. Often a term extension is needed in the short term in order to evaluate the need for further corrective action. Payment delays and interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness is not an available option for restructured loans. 
 Non-Performing Assets. When a borrower violates a condition of a loan, the Bank attempts to cure the default by contacting the borrower. In most cases, defaults are cured promptly. If the default is not cured within an appropriate time frame, typically 90 days, the Bank may institute appropriate action to collect the loan, such as making demand for payment or initiating foreclosure proceedings on the collateral. If foreclosure occurs, the collateral will typically be sold at public auction and may be purchased by the Bank. 
 Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collecting interest or principal is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. The Bank does not accrue interest on loans 90 days past due or more. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information. 
 For commercial loans, six consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are generally required prior to returning the loan to accrual status. In some instances after the required six consecutive payments are made, a management assessment will conclude that collection of the entire principal balance is still in doubt. In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual. Homogeneous loans may or may not be on accrual status at the time of restructuring, but all are placed on accrual status upon the restructuring of the loan. 
 Real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu thereof REO or Real Estate Owned is classified as real estate held for sale. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the fair market value less estimated selling costs at the date of acquisition. Interest accrual ceases on the date of acquisition and all costs incurred in maintaining the property from that date forward are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for the improvement or development of such property are capitalized. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table sets forth information regarding the Bank's non-performing assets. 
 September 30, 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Commercial loans Multi-family 18,743 5,127 5,912 475 Commercial real estate 26,362 23,435 4,691 8,038 3,771 Commercial industrial 6,082 5,693 365 329 Construction 1,120 505 1,669 Land acquisition development 74 2,340 Total commercial loans 46,299 34,644 16,296 11,723 5,769 Consumer loans Single-family residential 21,488 14,918 17,450 19,320 22,431 Construction custom 848 88 435 Land consumer lot loans 9 84 359 243 HELOC 596 736 233 287 553 Consumer 310 27 36 60 60 Total consumer loans 23,242 15,778 18,238 20,026 23,287 Total non-accrual loans (1) 69,541 50,422 34,534 31,749 29,056 Real estate owned 4,567 4,149 6,667 8,204 4,966 Other property owned 3,310 3,353 3,353 3,672 3,673 Total non-performing assets 77,418 57,924 44,554 43,625 37,695 Total non-performing assets to total assets 0.28 0.26 0.21 0.22 0.20 
 (1) For the year ended September 30, 2024, the Bank recognized 1,775,000 in interest income on cash payments received from borrowers on non-accrual loans. The Bank would have recognized interest income of 3,081,000 for the same period had these loans performed according to their original contract terms. The recognized interest income may include more than twelve months of interest for some of the non-accrual loans that were brought current or paid off. In addition to the non-accrual loans reflected in the above table, the Bank had 356,893,000 of loans that were less than 90 days delinquent at September 30, 2024 but were classified as substandard for one or more reasons. If these loans were deemed non-performing, the Company's ratio of total non-performing assets and performing restructured loans as a percent of total assets would have increased to 1.55 at September 30, 2024. For a discussion of the Bank's policy for placing loans on non-accrual status, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Non-performing assets increased 33.7 to 77,418,000, or 0.28 of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared to 57,924,000, or 0.26 of total assets, at September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily a result of an increase of 19,119,000 in non-accrual loans partially offset by a 418,000 increase in real estate owned. Other property owned of 3,310,000 as of September 30, 2024 is comprised entirely of a government guarantee related to equipment obtained via a commercial loan foreclosure. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, real estate owned totaled 4,567,000, an increase of 418,000, or 10.1 , from 4,149,000 as of September 30, 2023. During 2024, the Bank sold real estate owned properties for total net proceeds of 6,802,000. The majority of REO properties are former bank premises that are expected to be sold. 
 The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans decreased to 293 as of September 30, 2024, from 351 as of September 30, 2023.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Cash and cash equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents increased to 2,381,102,000 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 980,649,000 at September 30, 2023. This increase reflects cash received from LBC as a result of the Merger combined with cash received from the recent LBC multi-family and LBC single-family residential loan portfolio sales, offset by pay-downs on borrowings. 
 Available-for-sale investment securities : Available-for-sale securities increased 577,612,000, or 29.0 , during the year ended September 30, 2024, to 2,572,709,000, due to the addition of 516,308,000 in AFS investments obtained in the Merger combined with normal investing activity. During this time, the Bank had purchases of 549,159,000 offset by principal repayments and maturities of 386,564,000 and sales of 182,682,000. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities of 44,168,000, which is recorded net of tax within AOCI, compared to an unrealized loss of 123,519,000 as of September 30, 2023. 
 Substantially all of the Company s AFS debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. The remaining securities are issued by highly-rated municipalities or corporate borrowers. The Company does not believe that any of its AFS debt securities have credit loss impairment as of September 30, 2024, therefore, no allowance was recorded. The impact going forward will depend on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the securities portfolios as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods. 
 Held-to-maturity investment securities : Held-to-maturity securities increased by 13,386,000 to 436,972,000, or 3.2 , during the year ended September 30, 2024, largely due to the purchase of 47,092,000 of HTM securities. These purchases were offset by principal repayments and maturities of 36,013,000 during the period. The increase also included 2,570,000 in HTM securities obtained in the Merger. There were no held-to-maturity securities sold during the year ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the net unrealized loss on held-to-maturity securities was 35,926,000, compared to 68,398,000 the year prior, which management attributes to the change in interest rates since acquisition. 
 Substantially all of the Company s HTM debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss, thus the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for HTM securities as of September 30, 2024. The impact going forward will depend on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the securities portfolios as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods.

 Loans receivable: Loans receivable, net of related contra accounts, increased 3,439,804,000, or 19.7 , to 20,916,354,000 at September 30, 2024, from 17,476,550,000 one year earlier. The increase resulted primarily from the addition of loans obtained in the Merger. The balance change also reflects originations of 3,632,071,000, a decrease to loans-in-process of 886,142,000 and principal repayments of 4,302,359,000 during the year ended September 30, 2024. Commercial loan originations

 The contractual loan payment period for residential mortgage loans originated by the Bank normally ranges from 15 to 30 years. Experience during recent years has indicated that, because of prepayments in connection with refinancing and sales of property, residential loans typically have a weighted average life of approximately eight years.

 Historically, a significant number of time deposit account holders roll over their balances into new time deposits of the same term at the Bank s then current rate. To ensure a continuity of this trend, the Bank expects to continue to offer market rates of interest. The ability to retain maturing time deposits is difficult to project; however, the Bank believes that by competitively pricing these certificates, roll-over levels deemed appropriate by management can be achieved on a continuing basis. 
 54 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 At September 30, 2024, the Bank had 4,024,661,000 of time deposits in amounts of 250,000 or more outstanding, maturing as follows: 1,057,121,000 within 3 months; 1,277,315,000 over 3 months through 6 months; 1,030,587,000 over 6 months through 12 months; and 659,638,000 thereafter. 
 Time deposits with a maturity of one year or less have penalties for premature withdrawal equal to 90 days of interest. When the maturity is greater than one year but less than four years, the penalty is 180 days of interest. When the maturity is greater than four years, the penalty is 365 days of interest. Early withdrawal penalty fee income for the years ended 2024, 2023 and 2022 amounted to 1,082,000, 1,618,000 and 267,000, respectively. 
 For additional details on customer accounts, including uninsured deposits, see Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 
 
 Borrowings : Total borrowings decreased to 3,267,589,000 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 3,650,000,000 at September 30, 2023. The weighted average rate for borrowings was 3.93 as of September 30, 2024, versus 3.98 at September 30, 2023, the decrease being primarily due to higher rates on new short-term borrowings. The Bank has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk and convert certain FHLB advances to fixed rate payments. Taking into account these hedges, the weighted average effective maturity of FHLB advances at September 30, 2024 was 2.34 years. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 COMPARISON OF 2024 RESULTS WITH 2023 
 Net Income : Net income decreased 57,385,000, or 22.3 , to 200,041,000 for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 257,426,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023. The change was due to the factors described below. 
 Net Interest Income : For the year ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was 660,832,000, a decrease of 29,402,000 or 4.3 from the year ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin was 2.69 for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.40 in the prior year. The decrease was the result of the combination of greater growth in interest-bearing liabilities balances than in interest-paying assets and a larger increase in the rate paid on those liabilities compared to the rates earned on interest-earning assets. Average interest-bearing liabilities grew by 27.2 while average interest-earning assets grew by 20.8 . Rates on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 128 basis points outpacing the 46 basis points increase in the average rate on interest-earning assets. 
 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 The table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the years indicated. For each category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to: (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old average volume). The change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

 Provision for Credit Losses : The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 17,500,000 in 2024, compared to a provision of 41,500,000 for 2023. In 2024, the provision included the initial provision of 16,000,000 recorded on LBC loans acquired, as well as adjustments resulting from qualitative considerations such as prolonged and intensified borrower sensitivity to high interest rates and operating costs due to inflationary pressures. For the year ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs were 1,356,000, compared to 45,101,000 in the prior year. 
 
 Non-interest Income : Non-interest income was 60,692,000 for the year ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 8,491,000, or 16.3 , from 52,201,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income is primarily due to increased income from the Company's subsidiary, WAFD Insurance Group combined with a decrease in unrealized losses recorded for certain equity method investments in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. The reduced losses on the equity method investment made up 2,371,000 of the overall increase. 
 
 Non-interest Expense : Total non-interest expense was 448,272,000 for the year ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 72,237,000, or 19.2 , from the 376,035,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023. Compensation and benefits costs increased 37,614,000 or 19.1 year-over-year primarily due to Merger-related retention, severance and change-in-control expenses combined with a larger post-Merger workforce. FDIC premiums increased 8,845,000 in 2024 compared to the prior year as a result of both the FDIC's special assessment and the Company's increased size post-Merger. Information technology costs increased by 3,859,000 in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to increased telephone and data lines combined with conversion costs and termination fees related to the Merger. Other expense increased by 18,449,000 and included Merger-related expenses of 8,873,000, a 2,000,000 charitable donation and 6,626,000 in amortization expense related to the core deposit intangible asset created in the Merger. 
 
 The Company s efficiency ratio was 62.1 for 2024 as compared to 50.7 for the prior year. The number of staff, including part-time employees on a full-time equivalent basis, was 2,208 and 2,120 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total operating expense for the years ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 1.71 and 1.74 , respectively, of average assets. 
 
 Gain on Real Estate Owned : Gain on real estate owned, net was 304,000 for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to of 176,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023. This amount includes ongoing maintenance expense, periodic valuation adjustments, and gains on sales of REO.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Income Tax Expense : Income tax expense was 56,015,000 for the year ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 11,635,000, or 17.2 , from the 67,650,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is mostly due to an 21.2 decrease in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for 2024 was 21.88 as compared to 20.81 for the year ended September 30, 2023. The Company's effective tax rate varies from the Federal statutory rate of 21 mainly due to state taxes, tax-exempt income and tax-credit investments. For the current year, income tax was also impacted by the LBC Merger and consideration of California State and Local taxes. 

COMPARISON OF 2023 RESULTS WITH 2022 
 
 For management's review of the factors that affected our results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 17, 2023. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 The principal sources of funds for the Company's activities are loan repayments (including prepayments), net deposit inflows, borrowings, repayments and sales of investments and retained earnings, if applicable. The Company's principal sources of revenue are interest on loans and interest and dividends on investments. Additionally, the Company earns fee income for loan, deposit, insurance and other services. 
 On February 8, 2021, in connection with an underwritten public offering, the Company issued 300,000 shares of 4.875 Noncumulative Perpetual Series A Preferred Stock Series A Preferred Stock ). Net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses, were 293,325,000. The public offering consisted of the issuance and sale of 12,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Series A Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of 25.00 per depositary share. Holders of the depositary shares are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). The depositary shares are traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol "WAFDP." The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Company, subject to all applicable regulatory approvals, on or after April 15, 2026. 
 The Company's shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024, was 3,000,300,000, or 10.69 of total assets, as compared to 2,426,426,000, or 10.80 of total assets, at September 30, 2023. The Company's shareholders' equity was greatly impacted in the year by the stock issued in the Merger valued at 465,504,000. Other items affecting shareholders' equity were net income of 200,041,000, the payment of 74,267,000 in Common Stock dividends, payment of 14,625,000 in preferred stock dividends, 27,069,000 of treasury stock purchases, as well as other comprehensive loss of 8,930,000. The Company paid out 41.2 of its 2024 earnings in cash dividends to common shareholders, compared with 26.6 last year. For the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company returned 50.7 of net income to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases as compared to 36.6 for the year ended September 30, 2023. Management believes the Company's strong net worth position allows it to manage balance sheet risk and provide the capital support needed for controlled growth in a regulated environment. The Company s share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, and the timing and amount of share repurchases is subject to market conditions and the market price of the Company s Common Stock, as well as other factors. 
 The Bank has a credit line with the FHLB - DM of up to 45 of total assets depending on specific collateral eligibility. This line provides the Bank a substantial source of additional liquidity. The Bank has entered into borrowing agreements with the FHLB - DM to borrow funds under a short-term floating rate cash management advance program and fixed-rate term loan agreements. All borrowings are secured by stock of the FHLB - DM, deposits with the FHLB - DM, and a blanket pledge of qualifying loans receivable. The Bank also has a credit line with the FHLB - SF in support of LBC borrowings from the FHLB - SF, but the Bank is unable to take down new advances against this line. The FHLB - SF credit line is secured by a line-item

 pledge of single-family residential mortgages that are specifically identified. Based on collateral pledged as of September 30, 2024, the Bank had 6,029,890,000 of additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB - DM. 
 
 To ensure ample contingent liquidity the Bank participates in the FRB of San Francisco Borrower-in-Custody program which collateralizes primary credit borrowings and serves as a backstop for the FHLB - DM credit line. Due to differing program requirements between the FHLB - DM and FRB of San Francisco, participating in both increases the amount of eligible collateral that may be pledged in support of contingent liquidity needs. The Bank is also eligible to borrow under the Federal Reserve Bank's primary credit program. The Bank elected to utilize the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Funding Program ("BTFP") to leverage its highly favorable terms to fortify the Bank's liquidity position. These borrowings are repayable at any time without penalty and are currently the lowest cost funding source available. The Federal Reserve ceased making new BTFP loans on March 11, 2024. 
 The Company's cash and cash equivalents were 2,381,102,000 at September 30, 2024, which is a 142.8 increase from the balance of 980,649,000 as of September 30, 2023. During the year, the Company completed the sale of approximately 2,800,000,000 in multifamily loans and approximately 400,000,000 in single-family loans from the acquired LBC loan portfolio. The proceeds from the sales have increased liquidity adding approximately 1 billion in cash after paying down borrowings. See Changes in Financial Condition above and the Statement of Cash Flows included in the financial statements for additional details regarding this change.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

INTEREST RATE RISK 
 
 The primary source of income for the Bank is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred for interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Both the pricing and mix of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities influence these factors. All else being equal, if the interest rates on the Company's interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on its interest-earning assets, the result would be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in net earnings. Conversely, if the interest rates on the Company's interest-bearing liabilities decrease at a slower pace than the interest rates on its interest-earning assets, the result would be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in net earnings. 
 
 Interest rates, both in terms of their overall levels and volatility, can greatly influence our profitability. Our goal in managing interest rate risk is to assess and control how changes in interest rates affect our net interest income, helping us achieve our financial objectives. We mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations through actions determined by the Asset/Liability Management Committee ("ALCO"). This committee meets at least quarterly to establish asset/liability management policies, develop and implement strategies to enhance balance sheet positioning and earnings, and assess interest rate sensitivity. The Company's Board oversees the asset/liability management process, reviews interest rate risk analyses prepared by ALCO, and annually approves the Financial Management policy. 
 
 Interest rate risk arises in part due to the Bank's significant holdings of fixed-rate single-family home loans, which are longer-term than customer accounts that constitute its primary liabilities. Accordingly, assets do not usually respond as quickly to changes in interest rates as liabilities. In the absence of management action, net interest income can be expected to decline when interest rates rise and to expand when interest rates fall. Shortening the maturity or repricing of the investment portfolio is one action that management can take. The composition of the investment portfolio was 53.8 variable rate and 46.2 fixed rate as of September 30, 2024 to provide some protection against changing rates. In addition, the Bank is producing more commercial loans that have shorter terms and/or variable rates. There has also been focus on increasing less rate sensitive transaction deposit accounts. These accounts make up 55.3 of the deposit portfolio as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company's balance sheet strategy, in conjunction with low operating costs, has allowed the Company to manage interest rate risk, within guidelines established by the Board, through all interest rate cycles. It is Management's objective to grow the dollar amount of net interest income, through the rate cycles, acknowledging that there will be some periods of time when that will not be feasible. Cash and cash equivalents of 2,381,102,000 and shareholders' equity of 3,000,300,000 provide management with flexibility in managing interest rate risk. Based on management's assessment of the current interest rate environment, the Company has taken steps, including growing commercial loans having shorter average lives and transaction deposit accounts, to position itself for changing interest rates. 
 
 Net Interest Income Sensitivity. We estimate the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates using an interest rate simulation model that includes assumptions related to the level of balance sheet growth, deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments for multiple interest rate change scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity depends on certain repricing characteristics in our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including the maturity term structure, contractual rate changes and prepayment/attrition characteristics of assets and liabilities, all of which vary with changes in market interest rates. The analysis presented below assumes a constant balance sheet. Actual results would differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts loan and deposit pricing and the composition and overall size of the balance sheet to respond to changing interest rates. 
 In the event of an immediate and parallel decrease of 200 basis points across all interest rates, the model estimates that net interest income would decrease 1.0 in the next year. This compares to an estimated increase of 7.8 for the same measure as of September 30, 2023. It is noted that a steepening yield curve where the spread between short-term rates and long-term rates increases would likely result in higher net interest income. 
 In the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points across all interest rates, the model estimates that net interest income would increase by 2.8 in the next year. This compares to an estimated decrease of 2.0 for the same measure as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 59 

Net Portfolio Value ("NPV") Sensitivity. The NPV is an estimate of the market value of shareholders' equity at a point in time. It is derived by calculating the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and the present value of expected cash flows from liabilities and off-balance-sheet contracts. The sensitivity of the NPV to changes in interest rates provides a longer-term view of interest rate risk of the current balance sheet as it incorporates all future expected cash flows. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, in the event of an immediate and parallel decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV is estimated to increase by 273,000,000, or 9.2 , and the NPV-to-total assets ratio to increase to 11.6 from a base of 11.0 . As of September 30, 2023, in the event of an immediate and parallel decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV was estimated to increase by 583,000,000, or 22.1 , and the NPV-to-total assets ratio to increase to 14.3 from a base of 12.4 . The change in the sensitivity of the NPV ratio to this assumed change in interest rates is primarily due to the steepening of the yield curve and changes in balance sheet mix year over year. Prepayment speeds for single family mortgages are increasing though still low at September 30, 2024 with the Bank's conditional payment rate ("CPR") for this portfolio segment at 8.6 , up slightly from 7.0 the year before. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV is estimated to decrease by 741,000,000, or 24.9 , and the NPV-to-total assets ratio to decline to 8.7 from a base of 11.0 . As of September 30, 2023, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV was estimated to decrease by 723,000,000, or 27.4 , and the NPV-to-total assets ratio to decline to 9.5 from a base of 12.4 . Opposite to the down scenario above, this change in the sensitivity of the NPV ratio to the assumed change in interest rates is due to the flattening of the yield curve and changes in balance sheet mix year over year in this scenario. 
 
 Interest Rates. The Company measures the difference between the rate on interest-earning assets and the rate on interest-bearing liabilities at the end of each period. The period end interest rate spread was 1.91 at September 30, 2024 and 2.61 at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average rate on interest-earning assets increased by 4 basis points to 5.11 compared to September 30, 2023. The higher rate on interest-earning assets is due primarily to the Federal Reserve Bank's rate increases from March 2022 until September 2024, which have led to higher rates on adjustable rate loans, investment securities and cash as well as asset mix shifting to loans receivable. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 74 basis points to 3.20 compared to September 30, 2023. The higher rate on interest-bearing liabilities primarily resulted from the addition of higher yielding deposits in the Merger which also had a higher concentration of the rate sensitive time deposits, customer deposits repricing and higher rates on new borrowings. The period end interest rate spread for the last eight fiscal quarters is shown below: 
 SEP 2024 JUN 2024 MAR 2024 DEC 2023 SEP 2023 JUN 2023 MAR 2023 DEC 2022 Interest rate on loans and mortgage-backed securities 5.16 5.18 4.94 5.11 5.08 4.97 4.81 4.59 Interest rate on other interest-earning assets 4.85 5.13 5.02 4.94 4.98 4.74 4.45 3.19 Combined, all interest-earning assets 5.11 5.17 4.94 5.09 5.07 4.94 4.77 4.46 Interest rate on customer accounts 3.09 2.91 2.92 2.35 2.12 1.82 1.48 0.94 Interest rate on borrowings (1) 3.93 4.10 4.48 3.99 3.98 3.93 3.69 3.14 Combined cost of funds 3.20 3.10 3.24 2.67 2.46 2.22 1.91 1.29 Interest rate spread 1.91 2.07 1.70 2.42 2.61 2.72 2.86 3.17 (1) Represents the effective rate taking into consideration cash flow hedges on FHLB borrowings. 
 
 60 

The chart below shows the volatility of our period end net interest spread (dashed line measured against the right axis) compared to the relatively consistent growth in net interest income (solid line measured against the left axis). The relative consistency of net interest income is accomplished by actively managing the size and composition of the balance sheet through different rate cycles. 

Net Interest Margin. The net interest margin is measured using net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets for the period. The net interest margin decreased to 2.69 for the year ended September 30, 2024, from 3.40 for the year ended September 30, 2023. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 46 basis points to 5.59 and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 128 basis points to 3.46 . The higher yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to the impact of rising rates on adjustable rate assets and cash. The higher rate in interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to higher rates on interest-bearing customer accounts combined with the higher interest rates on borrowings and customer accounts obtained in the Merger. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2024, average interest-earning assets increased by 20.8 to 24,559,665,000, up from 20,327,301,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023. Balance sheet growth in 2024 was primarily due to the Merger. During 2024, average loans receivable increased 3,405,267,000, or 19.9 , while the combined average balances of mortgage-backed securities, other investment securities and cash increased by 822,850,000 or 26.5 . 
 
 During 2024, average interest-bearing customer deposit accounts increased 3,420,825,000 or 26.5 and the average balance of borrowings increased by 980,514,000, or 30.1 , from 2023, primarily due to the Merger.

The following table sets forth the information explaining the changes in the net interest income and net interest margin.

The following table shows the potential impact of changing interest rates on net income for one year. The Company's focus is primarily on the impact of abrupt upward or downward changes in short term rates. It is important to note that this is not a forecast or prediction of future events, but is used as a tool for measuring potential risk. This analysis assumes zero balance sheet growth and a constant percentage composition of assets and liabilities. 
 Potential Increase (Decrease) in Net Interest Income Basis Point Increase (Decrease) in Interest Rates September 30, 2024 (In thousands, except percentages) (300) (35,155) (4.27) (200) (8,414) (1.02) (100) 1,702 0.21 100 (274) (0.03) 200 22,686 2.76 
 
 Actual results will differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts both the size and the composition of the balance sheet in order to respond to changing interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, it is likely that the Company will grow its balance sheet to offset margin compression that may occur. Improvement in the net interest income sensitivity during the year is primarily the result of interest rate swap activity, as well as increased time deposits and an increased federal funds balances which help reduce sensitivity in rising shock scenarios. 
 
 Another method used to quantify interest rate risk is the NPV analysis. This analysis calculates the difference between the present value of interest-bearing liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from interest-earning assets and off-balance-sheet contracts. The following tables set forth an analysis of the Company s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in NPV resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (measured in 100-basis-point increments). 
 
 The tables below express the NPV under varying interest scenarios.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of its interest rate risk policy limits.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of WaFd, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of WaFd, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses - Refer to Notes A and E to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The estimate of the Company s expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is based on relevant information about current conditions, past events, and reasonable and supportable forecasts regarding collectability of the reported amounts. In order to estimate the allowance for loan losses ALL ), the Company used either a cohort or weighted average remaining maturities methodology to determine the historical loss rate, by loan portfolio class, then considered whether qualitative adjustments to those historical loss rates were warranted. 
 
 Significant management judgments are required in determining whether, and to what extent, qualitative adjustments for each portfolio loan class are required. These adjustments are made after considering the conditions over the period from which historical loss experience was based and are split into two components: 1) asset or class specific risk characteristics or current 
 65 

conditions at the reporting date related to portfolio credit quality, remaining payments, volume and nature, credit culture and management, business environment or other management factors, not captured in the historical loss rates and 2) reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and collateral values. 
 
 Given the significance of the ALL and management judgment required for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, performing audit procedures to evaluate the ALL requires a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort. 
 
 We have identified the ALL estimate for certain loan portfolio classes as a critical audit matter based upon the above factors. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the ALL estimate for loan portfolio classes for which we concluded the ALL was significant included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over model applicability, qualitative adjustments, the reasonable and supportable forecast adjustments, and management's review and approval process over the final determination of the ALL. 
 
 We tested the underlying data and mathematical accuracy of the cohort methodology used to determine most loan portfolio class historical loss rates. 
 
 We involved credit specialists to assist us in evaluating the reasonableness and conceptual soundness of the methodologies applied in the credit loss estimation model. 
 
 To test the qualitative adjustments, we performed analysis to evaluate management s determination of the qualitative adjustments made to account for specific risk characteristics or current conditions that differ from the period over which the historical loss rate was determined. Our procedures included evaluating management s inputs and assumptions used in determining the qualitative and forecast adjustments by comparing the information to internal and external source data including, among others, the economic forecasts utilized by the Company and third-party economic forecasts for selected assumptions. In addition, we performed procedures on the overall ALL amount, inclusive of the qualitative adjustments, by evaluating the Company s analysis of peers estimated current expected credit losses for loans to the Company s recorded ALL. 

Fair Value of Acquired Loans Receivable and Core Deposit Intangible Assets - Refer to Note B to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 On February 29, 2024, WaFd, Inc. closed its previously announced merger with Luther Burbank Corporation ("Luther Burbank" or "LBC") a California corporation, effective as of March 1, 2024 (the Merger Date ). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Luther Burbank merged with and into the Company (the Corporate Merger ), with the Company surviving the Corporate Merger. Promptly following the Corporate Merger, Luther Burbank s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Luther Burbank Savings, merged with and into WaFd Bank with WaFd Bank as the surviving institution. 
 
 The Corporate Merger has been accounted for as a business combination. Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Management utilizes prevailing valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values. This method often involves estimates based on third party valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the total purchase consideration to the estimated fair values of the acquired loans receivable acquired loans and core deposit intangible assets acquired was 3.2 billion and 37 million at the Merger Date, respectively. 
 
 A valuation of the acquired loans was performed by a third party, as of the Merger Date, to assess the fair value. The loans were valued at the pool level, based on loan type and interest rate terms, using a discounted cash flow methodology. The methodology included projecting cash flows based on the contractual terms of the loans and the cash flows were adjusted to reflect credit loss expectations along with prepayments. Discount rates were developed based on the relative risk of the cash 
 66 

flows, taking into consideration the loan type, market rates as of the valuation date, recent originations in the portfolio, credit loss expectations, and liquidity expectations. Lastly, cash flows adjusted for credit loss expectations were discounted to present value and summed to arrive at the fair value of the loans. 
 
 The fair value of the core deposit intangible assets was estimated based on a cost savings methodology as of the Merger Date that gave consideration to expected customer attrition rates, net maintenance cost of the deposit base, interest costs associated with customer deposits, and the alternative cost of funds. 
 
 We identified the fair value of the acquired loans and the core deposit intangible assets as part of the Corporate Merger as a critical audit matter because a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our valuation specialists, was required to evaluate the reasonableness of the methodologies and certain assumptions used by management to determine the fair values. Specifically, the (i) credit assumptions, (ii) discount rate, and (iii) prepayment rate used for acquired loans, and the (iv) discount rate, (v) attrition assumptions, (vi) maintenance expense assumptions, and (vii) the alternative cost of funds for the core deposit intangible assets. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the methodologies and certain assumptions used by management to determine the fair values of the acquired loans and the core deposit intangible assets as part of the Corporate Merger included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over the purchase accounting allocation, including those over the valuation methodologies and assumptions utilized. 
 
 We evaluated, with the assistance of our fair value specialists, the appropriateness of the (i) valuation methodologies, (ii) credit assumptions, discount rate, and prepayment rate assumptions used for acquired loans, and the discount rate, attrition, maintenance expense, and the alternative cost of funds assumptions for core deposit intangible assets, as well as the (iii) mathematical accuracy of the valuation calculations. 
 
 We tested the completeness and accuracy of certain underlying loan and deposit information used in the valuation of the acquired loans and the core deposit intangible assets, respectively.

 Debt securities, including mortgage-backed securities. The Company accounts for debt securities in two categories: held-to-maturity ("HTM") and available-for-sale ("AFS"). Premiums and discounts on debt securities are deferred and recognized into income over the contractual life of the asset using the effective interest method. 
 HTM securities are accounted for at amortized cost, but the Company must have both the positive intent and the ability to hold those securities to maturity. There are very limited circumstances under which securities in the HTM category can be sold without jeopardizing the cost basis of accounting for the remainder of the securities in this category. 
 Available-for-sale securities are accounted for at fair value. Gains and losses realized on the sale of these securities are accounted for based on the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses for AFS securities are excluded from earnings and reported net of the related tax effect in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders' equity.

These loan portfolio segments are further disaggregated into classes, which represent loans of similar type, risk characteristics, and methods for monitoring and assessing credit risk. The commercial loan portfolio segment is disaggregated into classes: multi-family, commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, construction, and land acquisition and development. The risk of loss for the commercial loan portfolio segment is generally most indicated by the credit risk rating assigned to each borrower. Commercial loan risk ratings are determined by experienced senior credit officers based on specific facts and circumstances and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists. The consumer loan portfolio segment is disaggregated into classes: single-family-residential mortgage, custom construction, consumer lot loans, home equity lines of credit, and other consumer. The risk of loss for the consumer loan portfolio segment is generally most indicated by delinquency status and general economic factors. Each commercial and consumer loan portfolio class may also be further segmented based on risk characteristics.

 days or more past due. If payment is made on a loan so that the loan becomes less than days past due, and the Company expects full collection of principal and interest, the loan is returned to full accrual status. Any interest ultimately collected is credited to income in the period of recovery. A loan is charged-off when the loss is estimable, and it is confirmed that the borrower is not expected to be able to meet contractual obligations. 
 consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are required prior to returning the loan to accrual status. In some instances, after the required consecutive payments are made, management will conclude that collection of the entire principal and interest due is still in doubt. In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual status.

The Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Merger were recorded at their respective acquisition date estimated fair values and have been adjusted subsequent to the Merger Date based on new information. These estimates were recorded based on initial valuations available at the Merger Date, and these estimates, including initial accounting for deferred taxes, are considered preliminary as of September 30, 2024. In many cases, the determination of fair value required management to make estimates about discount rates, expected future cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. While the Company believes that the information available on the Merger Date provided a reasonable basis for estimating fair value, additional information may be obtained during the measurement period that would result in changes to the estimated fair value amounts. The measurement period ends on the earlier of one year after the Merger Date or the date the Company concludes that all necessary information about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the Merger Date have been obtained. Management anticipates that facts obtained during the measurement period could result in adjustments to the Merger Date valuation amounts presented herein.

In connection with the Merger, the Company recorded approximately of goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired net of fair value of liabilities assumed. Information regarding goodwill and the carrying amount and amortization of intangible assets are provided in Note A. 
 
 The following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair values of significant assets and liabilities presented above. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amount of these items is a reasonable estimate of their fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets. 
 
 Investment securities Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices. The actual sales prices of securities were used for those securities sold in March 2024, shortly after the Merger, rather than the quoted market price as sales prices were determined to be the best indicator of fair value. 
 
 Loans receivable A valuation of the loans held for investment portfolio was performed by a third party as of the Merger Date to assess the fair value. The loans held for investment portfolio was segmented into three groups, including performing purchased credit deteriorated ("PCD") loans, non-performing PCD loans and non-PCD loans. The loans were further pooled based on loan type and interest rate terms. The loans were valued at the pool level using a discounted cash flow methodology. The methodology included projecting cash flows based on the contractual terms of the loans and the cash flows were adjusted to reflect credit loss expectations along with prepayments. Discount rates were developed based on the relative risk of the cash

 PCD ACL at acquisition 
 ) Non-credit discount on PCD loans 
 ) Fair value of PCD loans 

Loans held for sale The loans held for sale portfolio was recorded at fair value based on quotes or bids from third parties. 
 
 Premises and equipment - The fair values of premises are based on a market approach by obtaining third-party appraisals and broker opinions of value for land, office and branch space. 
 
 Core deposit intangible The core deposit intangible represents the low cost of funding acquired core deposits provide relative to the Company s marginal cost of funds. The fair value was estimated based on a cost savings methodology that gave consideration to expected customer attrition rates, net maintenance cost of the deposit base, interest costs associated with customer deposits, and the alternative cost of funds. The estimated fair value was grossed-up for the expected tax amortization benefit. The intangible asset is being amortized over years using an accelerated method, based upon the period over which estimated economic benefits are estimated to be received. 
 
 Customer Accounts The fair values used for the demand and savings deposits equal the amount payable on demand at the Merger Date. The fair value of time deposits is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using current rates offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities. 
 
 Borrowings The fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances and Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") borrowings is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar remaining maturities. 
 
 The operating results of the Company include the operating results produced by the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in the Merger for the period March 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024.

Substantially all of the Company s held-to-maturity debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Therefore, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for these securities as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. The Company does not consider HTM investments to have any credit impairment. 
 
 The Company does not believe that the available-for-sale debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position have any credit loss impairment as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. The Company does not intend to sell the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.

None of the loans modified in the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 defaulted after modification. 
 
 We evaluate the credit quality of our commercial loans based on regulatory risk ratings and also consider other factors. It is important to note, just because a loan is risk-rated below a "pass" rating, it does not necessarily indicate there will be future charge-offs on that loan. Loans are downgraded because of either borrower specific or industry-wide financial or operating stresses. Based on this evaluation, the loans are assigned a grade and classified as follows: 
 
 Pass the credit does not meet one of the definitions below. 
 
 Special mention A special mention credit is considered to be currently protected from loss but is potentially weak. No loss of principal or interest is foreseen; however, proper supervision and management attention is required to deter further deterioration in the credit. Assets in this category constitute some undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying a risk rating of substandard. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitutes an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific asset. 
 
 Substandard A substandard credit is an unacceptable credit. Additionally, repayment in the normal course is in jeopardy due to the existence of one or more well defined weaknesses. In these situations, loss of principal is likely if the weakness is not corrected. A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified will have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of the debt. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets risk rated substandard. 
 
 Doubtful A credit classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. 
 
 Loss Credits classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. Losses should

The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of in 2024, compared to a provision of for 2023. In 2024, the provision included the initial reserves for acquired non-PCD loans. The increase in the overall ACL in 2024 was a combination of the provision recorded and the reserve for LBC PCD loans booked in purchase accounting. For the year ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs were , compared to in the prior year. A loan is charged-off when the loss is estimable and it is confirmed that the borrower is not expected to be able to meet its contractual obligations.

 As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for loan losses of is for loans that are evaluated on a pooled basis, which was comprised of related to the quantitative component and related to management's qualitative overlays (including the forecast component of the reserve). 
 The Company has an asset quality review function that analyzes its loan portfolio and reports the results of the review to its Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The single-family residential, HELOC and consumer portfolios are evaluated based on their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. The construction, land, multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans are risk rated on a loan by loan basis to determine the relative risk inherent in specific borrowers or loans. Based on that risk rating, the loans are assigned a grade and classified as described in Note D "Loans Receivable." It is important to note, just because a loan is risk-rated below a "pass" rating, it does not necessarily indicate there will be future charge-offs on that loan. Loans are downgraded because of either borrower specific or industry-wide financial or operating stresses.

 The Company enters into interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. These arrangements include hedges of individual fixed rate commercial loans and also hedges of a specified portion of pools of prepayable fixed rate mortgage loans under the "last of layer" method. These relationships qualify as fair value hedges under FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815"), which provides for offsetting of the recognition of gains and losses of the respective interest rate swap and the hedged items. Gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated in these hedge relationships, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings within the same income statement line item. 
 
 Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the hedged items are adjusted to reflect the cumulative impact of changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. The hedge basis adjustment remains with each hedged item until the hedged item is de-recognized from the balance sheet.

The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert certain short-term borrowings to fixed rate payments. The primary purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the risk of changes in future cash flows resulting from increasing interest rates. For qualifying cash flow hedges under ASC 815, gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and then reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged cash flows affect earnings and within the same income statement line item as the hedged cash flows.

 The Company periodically enters into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to provide commercial loan customers the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rate payments, while the Company retains a variable rate loan. Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan agreement and a swap agreement with the client. The swap agreement effectively converts the client s variable rate loan into a fixed rate. The Company enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third party in order to offset its exposure on the variable and fixed components of the client's swap agreement. The interest rate swaps are derivatives under ASC 815, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings.

As this standard is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements, the Company has omitted certain disclosures in ASC 606, including the disaggregation of revenue table. Sources of noninterest income within the scope of the guidance include the following: 
 
 Deposit related and other service charges (recognized in Deposit Fee Income) : The Company's deposit accounts are governed by standardized contracts customary in the industry. Revenues are earned at a point in time or over time (monthly) from account maintenance fees and charges for specific transactions such as wire transfers, stop payment orders, overdrafts, debit card replacements, check orders and cashiers' checks. The Company s performance obligation related to each of these fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, at the time the service is provided (point in time or monthly). The Company is principal in each of these contracts. 
 
 Debit and credit card interchange fees (recognized in Deposit Fee Income) : The Company receives interchange fees from the debit card and credit card payment networks based on transactions involving debit or credit cards issued by the Company, generally measured as a percentage of the underlying transaction. Interchange fees from debit and credit card transactions are recognized as the transaction processing services are provided by the network. The Company acts as an agent in the card payment network arrangement so the interchange fees are recorded net of any expenses paid to the principal (the card payment networks in this case).

The loss carryover amount is based in large part from the tax loss realized from the portfolio loan sale following the Luther Burbank merger.

 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the United States of America. 
 
 The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making the assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 version of its Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its assessment, the Company s management believes that as of September 30, 2024, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on this criteria. 
 
 The Company s independent auditors, Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, have issued an audit report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholders and Board of Directors of WaFd, Inc. 

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of WaFd, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Because management's assessment and our audit were conducted to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), management's assessment and our audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting included controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Instructions for Call Reports for Balance Sheet on schedule RC, Income Statement on schedule RI, and Changes in Company Equity Capital on schedule RI-A. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have not examined and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management's statement referring to compliance with laws and regulations. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Objectives Trading Policy Board Approved 2/13/23 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2024 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 1 1. Overview 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this Trading Policy (the Policy is to provide guidelines with respect to transactions in the securities of WaFd, Inc. (the Company and the handling of confidential information about the Company and the companies with which the Company does business. The Company s Board of Directors has adopted this Policy to promote compliance with federal, state and foreign securities laws that prohibit certain persons who are aware of material nonpublic information about a company from: (i) trading in securities of that company; or (ii) providing material nonpublic information to other persons who may trade on the basis of that information. This Policy supersedes any previous policy of the Company concerning insider trading. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Policy and any other materials previously distributed by the Company, this Policy shall govern. Failure to adhere to this Policy or any procedures issued pursuant hereto can result in disciplinary action or termination of employment. Questions regarding this Policy should be directed to the Legal Department of the Company. 1.2 Persons Subject to This Policy This Policy applies to all officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, all members of the Company s Board of Directors and all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company may also determine that other persons should be subject to this Policy, such as contractors or consultants who have access to material nonpublic information. This Policy also applies to family members, other members of a person s household and entities controlled by a person covered by this Policy, as described below. 1.3 Transactions Subject to This Policy This Policy applies to transactions in the Company s securities (collectively referred to in this Policy as Company Securities ), including the Company s common stock, options to purchase common stock, depositary shares, or any other type of securities that the Company may issue, including (but not limited to) preferred stock, convertible debentures and warrants, as well as derivative securities that are not issued by the Company, such as exchange-traded put or call options or swaps relating to the Company s Securities. 

Responsibilities and Authorizations Trading Policy Board Approved 2/13/24 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2024 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 2 2. Administration of Policy The Company s General Counsel shall serve as the Compliance Officer for the purposes of this Policy, and in his absence, the Chief Executive Officer or another employee designated by the Compliance Officer shall be responsible for administration of this Policy. This Policy shall be reviewed and approved annually by the Board of Directors. In addition, these procedures shall be communicated to the Company s directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries periodically. 

Trading Policy Board Approved 2/13/24 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2024 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 3 Reporting Rules Applicable to Covered Persons 3. Statement of Policy It is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or employee of the Company (or any other person designated by this Policy or by the Compliance Officer to be subject to this Policy) who is aware of material nonpublic information about the Company may, directly or indirectly (through family members or other persons or entities): A. Engage in any transactions in Company Securities, except as otherwise specified in this Policy under the headings Excluded Transactions, and Rule 10b5-1 Plans; B. Recommend to any person the purchase or sale of any Company Securities; C. Disclose material nonpublic information to persons within the Company whose jobs do not require them to have that information; D. Disclose material nonpublic information outside of the Company to other persons, including, but not limited to, family, friends, business associates, investors and expert consulting firms, unless any such disclosure is made in accordance with the Company s policies regarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of information regarding the Company; or E. Assist anyone engaged in the above activities. In addition, it is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or employee of the Company (or any other person designated as subject to this Policy) who, in the course of working for the Company, learns of material nonpublic information about a company with which the Company does business, may engage in transactions in that company s securities until the information becomes public or is no longer material. This includes any customer or supplier to the Company, or any person or entity that has a lending or other business relationship with the Company. Transactions in securities includes buying, selling, exchanging (with or without consideration), lending, or pledging a security. Bona fide gifts or donations of securities are not generally transactions subject to this Policy, unless the person making the gift has reason to believe that the recipient intends to sell the Company Securities while the person making the gift is aware of material nonpublic information. There are no exceptions to this Policy, except as specifically noted herein. Transactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons (such as the need to raise money for an emergency expenditure), or small transactions, are not excepted from this Policy. The securities laws do not recognize any mitigating circumstances, and, in any event, even the appearance of an improper transaction must be avoided to preserve the Company s reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct. 

Trading Policy Board Approved 2/13/24 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2024 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 4 Reporting Rules Applicable to Covered Persons 3.1 Definition of Material Nonpublic Information Information is considered material if a reasonable investor would consider that information important in making a decision to buy, hold or sell securities. Any information that could be expected to affect a company s stock price, whether it is positive or negative, should be considered material. There is no bright-line standard for assessing materiality; rather, materiality is based on an assessment of all of the facts and circumstances, and is often evaluated by enforcement authorities with the benefit of hindsight. While it is not possible to define all categories of material information, some examples of information that ordinarily would be regarded as material are: financial results, financial condition, projections or forecasts; changes to previously announced earnings guidance, or the decision to suspend earnings guidance; information about significant transactions, including proposed mergers, acquisitions, investment or divestitures; dividend information, information about a change in dividend policy, the declaration of a stock split; new equity or debt offerings; Information about a cybersecurity breach or any other significant disruption in the company s operations; significant related party transactions; positive or negative developments in outstanding litigation or regulatory matters; or changes in senior management or the Board of Directors. Information that has not been disclosed to the public is generally considered to be nonpublic information . In order to establish that the information has been disclosed to the public, it may be necessary to demonstrate that the information has been widely disseminated. Information generally would be considered widely disseminated if it has been disclosed through the Dow Jones broad tape, newswire services, a broadcast on widely-available radio or television programs, publication in a widely-available newspaper, magazine or news website, or contained in public disclosure documents filed with the SEC that are available on the SEC s website. By contrast, information would likely not be considered widely disseminated if it is available only to the Company s employees, or if it is only available to a select group of analysts, brokers and institutional investors. When in doubt, assume that Company information is material and nonpublic. Once information is widely disseminated, it is still necessary to provide the investing public with sufficient time to absorb the information. As a general rule, information should not be considered fully 

Trading Policy Board Approved 2/13/24 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2024 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 5 Reporting Rules Applicable to Covered Persons absorbed by the marketplace until after the first business day after the day on which the information is released. If, for example, the Company were to make an announcement on a Monday, a person subject to this Policy should not trade in Company Securities until Wednesday. Depending on the particular circumstances, the Company may determine that a longer or shorter period should apply to the release of specific material nonpublic information. If there are any questions as to whether information should be considered material or nonpublic, please consult with the Company s Compliance Officer or their delegate. 3.2 Particular Transactions Subject to this Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, this Policy applies to: Transactions by Family Members. This Policy applies to your family members who reside with you (including a spouse, a child, a child away at college, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents, grandparents, siblings and in-laws), anyone else who lives in your household, and any family members who do not live in the household but whose transactions in Company Securities are directed by you or subject to your influence or control, such as parents or children who consult with you before they trade in Company Securities (collectively referred to as Family Members ). All persons subject to this Policy are responsible for the transactions of your Family Members, and therefore you should make them aware of the need to confer with you before they trade in Company Securities. For purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws, you should treat all transactions in Company Securities by your Family Members as if the transactions were for your own account. Transactions by Entities you Influence or Control. Transactions by any entities you influence or control, including any corporations, partnerships or trusts (collectively referred to as Controlled Entities ), and transactions by these Controlled Entities should be treated for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if they were for your own account. Certain Stock Option Exercises. This Policy applies to any broker assisted cashless exercise of a stock option (as this entails selling a portion of the underlying stock to cover the costs of exercise), or any other sale of Company Securities for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option. Certain Elections under the Company s 401(k) Plan. This Policy applies to elections you may make under the Company s 401(k) plan, including (a) initial elections to the Company Common Stock Fund; (b) elections to increase or decrease the percentage of your periodic contributions that will be allocated to the Company Common Stock Fund; (c) an election to make an intra-plan transfer of an existing account balance into or out of a Company Common Stock Fund; (d) an election to borrow money against your 401(k) plan account if the loan will result in a liquidation of some or all of your Company Common Stock Fund balance; and (e) 

Trading Policy Board Approved 2/13/24 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2024 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 6 Reporting Rules Applicable to Covered Persons an election to pre pay a plan loan if the pre-payment will result in allocation of loan proceeds to the Company Common Stock Fund. Certain Elections under the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. This Policy applies to your election to participate in the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) for any enrollment period, and to any sales of Company Securities purchased pursuant to the ESPP. Certain transactions under the Company s Dividend Reinvestment Plan. This Policy applies to voluntary purchases of Company Securities resulting from additional contributions you choose to make to the Company s dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP), your election to participate in the DRIP, your election to increase your level of participation in the DRIP, and to any sale of any Company Securities purchased pursuant to the DRIP. 3.3 Special and Prohibited Transactions Investing in Company Securities provides an opportunity to share in the future growth of the Company. Investment in the Company and sharing in the growth of the Company, however, does not include, or justify, short-range speculation based on fluctuations in the market. Such activities may put the personal gain of persons subject to this Policy in conflict with the best interests of the Company. It therefore is the Company s policy that any persons covered by this Policy may not engage in any of the following transactions, or should otherwise consider the Company s preferences as described below: Short Sales. Short sales of Company Securities (i.e., the sale of a security that the seller does not own) may evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value, and therefore have the potential to signal to the market that the seller lacks confidence in the Company s prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce a seller s incentive to seek to improve the Company s performance. For these reasons, short sales of Company Securities are prohibited. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Exchange Act prohibits officers and directors from engaging in short sales. Derivative securities or hedging transactions. Given the relatively short term of publicly- traded options, transactions in options may create the appearance that a director, officer or employee is trading based on material nonpublic information and focus a director s, officer s or other employee s attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company s long-term objectives. Accordingly, trading in publicly-traded options, such as puts and calls, and other derivative securities with respect to Company Securities (other than stock options and other compensatory equity awards issued to you by the Company) is prohibited. This includes any hedging or similar transaction designed to decrease the risks associated with holding Company Securities. Hedging Transactions. Hedging or monetization transactions can be accomplished through a 

Trading Policy Board Approved 2/13/24 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2024 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 7 Reporting Rules Applicable to Covered Persons number of possible mechanisms, including through the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds. Such transactions may permit a director, officer or employee to continue to own Company Securities obtained through employee benefit plans or otherwise, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the director, officer or employee may no longer have the same objectives as the Company s other shareholders. Therefore, directors, officers and employees are prohibited from engaging in any such transactions. Margin Accounts and Pledged Securities. Securities held in a margin account as collateral for a margin loan may be sold by the broker without the customer s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Because a margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Company Securities, directors, officers and other employees are prohibited from holding Company Securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging Company Securities as collateral for a loan, other than pursuant to an approved a 10b5-1 trading plan that removes any discretion from the person subject to this Policy over trading in Company Securities. Standing and Limit Orders. Standing and limit orders (except standing and limit orders under approved Rule 10b5-1 Plans, as described below) create heightened risks for insider trading violations similar to the use of margin accounts. There is no control over the timing of purchases or sales that result from standing instructions to a broker, and as a result the broker could execute a transaction when a director, officer or other employee is in possession of material nonpublic information. The Company therefore discourages placing standing or limit orders on Company Securities. If a person subject to this Policy determines that they must use a standing order or limit order, the order should be limited to short duration and should otherwise comply with the restrictions and procedures outlined below under the heading Additional Procedures and Requirements for Covered Persons. 3.4 Excluded transactions. There are limited exceptions to this Policy, which are described below. This Policy does not prohibit: The acceptance or purchase of stock options, restricted stock or the like issued or offered by the Company pursuant to Company incentive plans, or the vesting, cancellation, or forfeiture of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or stock appreciation rights, or the acquisition or repurchase of shares pursuant to option exercises under Company incentive plans. The exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which a person has elected to have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements, or withhold shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of any 

Trading Policy Board Approved 2/13/24 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2024 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 8 Reporting Rules Applicable to Covered Persons restricted stock. (Note however that as provided above, this Policy does apply to broker- assisted cashless exercises, or any market sale for the purpose of generating the cash necessary to pay the exercise price of an option or to satisfy tax withholding obligations). Transactions in Company Securities occurring solely as a result of an employee s or the Company s periodic contribution of money to the Company s 401(k) plan pursuant to a payroll deduction election. Purchases of Company Securities under the Company s employee stock purchase plan resulting from your periodic contribution of money to the plan pursuant to the election made at the time of enrollment in the plan. Purchases of Company Securities under the Company s dividend reinvestment plan resulting from the automatic reinvestment of dividends paid on Company Securities. 3.5 Post-Termination Transactions This Policy continues to apply to transactions in Company Securities even after your retirement or other termination of service to the Company. If an individual is in possession of material nonpublic information when his or her service terminates, that individual may not trade in Company Securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. 3.6 Consequences of Violations The purchase or sale of securities while aware of material nonpublic information, or the disclosure of material nonpublic information to others who then trade in the Company s Securities, is prohibited by the federal and state laws. Insider trading violations are pursued vigorously by the SEC, U.S. Attorneys and state enforcement authorities as well as the laws of foreign jurisdictions. Punishment for insider trading violations is severe, and could include significant fines and imprisonment. While the regulatory authorities generally concentrate their efforts on the individuals who trade, or who tip inside information to others who trade, the federal securities laws also impose potential liability on companies and other controlling persons if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading by company personnel. In addition, an individual s failure to comply with this Policy may subject the individual to Company- imposed sanctions, including dismissal for cause, whether or not the employee s failure to comply results in a violation of law. Needless to say, a violation of law, or even an SEC investigation that does not result in prosecution, can tarnish a person s reputation and irreparably damage a career. 

Trading Policy Board Approved 2/13/24 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2024 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 9 Reporting Rules Applicable to Covered Persons 4. Additional Procedures and Requirements for Covered Persons The Company has established additional procedures in order to assist the Company in the administration of this Policy, to facilitate compliance with laws prohibiting insider trading while in possession of material nonpublic information, and to avoid the appearance of any impropriety. These additional procedures are applicable to (i) members of our Board of Directors, (ii) our executive officers, (iii) our Section 16 officers, and (iv) each other person identified by the Company s Compliance Officer as a Covered Person (each such person, a Covered Person ). 4.1 Open Trading Window In addition to being subject to all of the other terms of this Policy, and even if a person is not in possession of any material nonpublic information, a Covered Person and their Family Members may only buy or sell Company Securities during an open trading window. The Company s trading window will typically open at the start of the second full trading day after the public release of the Company s quarterly earnings and end fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the end of the next fiscal quarter. From time to time, the Company may also inform Covered Persons and their Family Members that they must suspend buying or selling Company Securities even during an open trading window -- because of developments known to the Company and not yet disclosed to the public. In such event, Covered Persons and their Family Members are prohibited from buying or selling Company Securities during such period and should not disclose to others the fact of such suspension of trading. 4.2 Pre-Clearance At least 48 hours before transacting in Company Securities, including any exercise of stock options, a Covered Person must obtain prior clearance from the Company s Compliance Officer, the Company s Chief Executive Officer or both the Company s (i) SVP, General Counsel and (ii) the SVP, Chief People Officer or his or her designee. Prior clearance is required for all trading, including transfers between the Company s Common Stock Fund and other investment options in the Company s 401(k) plans. Pre- clearance of a transaction is valid only for a 48-hour period. If the transaction order is not placed within that 48-hour period, pre-clearance of the transaction must be re-requested. If pre-clearance is denied, the fact of such denial must be kept confidential by the person requesting such clearance. 4.3 Rule 10b5-1 Plans The SEC has enacted rules that provide an affirmative defense against alleged violations of U.S. federal 

Trading Policy Board Approved 2/13/24 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2024 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 10 Reporting Rules Applicable to Covered Persons insider trading laws for transactions made pursuant to trading plans that meet certain requirements, commonly referred to as 10b5-1 trading plans. In order to be eligible to rely on this defense, a person subject to this Policy must enter into a 10b5-1 trading plan when such person is not in possession of material nonpublic information, must meet the requirements set forth in Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Rule 10b5-1 ), and must meet any requirements for such 10b5-1 trading plans or guidelines established by the Company, including pre-approval by the Compliance Officer. Transactions made pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan are not subject to the restrictions in this Policy, even if a person subject to this Policy is aware of material nonpublic information at the time of the transaction or a blackout period is in effect. Any Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be submitted for approval no less than ten days prior to the entry into the Rule 10b5-1 Plan. No further pre-approval of transactions conducted pursuant to the Rule 10b5-1 Plan will be required. 5. Reporting Rules Applicable to Covered Persons 5.1 Section 16 Insider Reports Section 16 of the Act regulates transactions in Company Securities by Covered Persons. Section 16 requires Covered Persons to publicly report their direct and indirect ownership of Company Securities, to report transactions in Company Securities, and to disgorge to the Company any short-swing profits which result from the purchase and sale of certain Company Securities within a six-month period. Each Covered Person must file with the SEC a Section 16 report on Form 3 within 10 calendar days (or shorter period if prescribed by regulations) of becoming a Covered Person. In addition, a Covered Person must also file with the SEC a Form 4 within two business days (or shorter period if prescribed by the regulations) after any change in their or their Family Members holdings of Company Securities that are not otherwise exempt from reporting. Under Section 16, and so long as certain other criteria are met, neither the receipt or exercise of an option nor the receipt of restricted stock under the Company s incentive plan is deemed a purchase under Section 16, but each must be reported under Section 16. The sale of any such shares is deemed a sale under Section 16 and may be matched against any non-exempt acquisition within six-months of the sale. There are very limited exemptions with respect to reporting transactions in Company Securities under Section 16, therefore a Covered Person should assume any transaction in Company Securities must be reported on a Form 4 within two business days unless otherwise informed by the Legal Department. The Company will assist Covered Persons in filing the required reports; however, reporting persons retain responsibility for the accuracy of the reports and their filing within the required timeframes. 

Trading Policy Board Approved 2/13/24 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2024 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 11 Reporting Rules Applicable to Covered Persons 5.2 Form 144 Reports Covered Persons are required to file a Form 144 before making an open market sale of Company Securities when the sale involves more than 5,000 shares or the aggregate dollar amount is greater than 50,000 in any three-month period. Form 144 notifies the SEC of your intent to sell Company securities. The form is generally prepared and filed by your broker and is in addition to the Section 16 reports filed on your behalf by the Company. 6. Company Assistance Any person who has a question about this Policy or its application to any proposed transaction may obtain additional guidance from the Company s Legal Department. 7. Amendments The Company is committed to continuously reviewing and updating its policies, and therefore reserves the right to amend this Policy at any time, for any reason, subject to applicable law.

Clawback Policy WaFd, Inc. Clawback Policy Effective 10/2/23 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2023 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 3 1. Objective WaFd, Inc. (the Company is committed to conducting business with integrity in accordance with high ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. This includes the Company s commitment to comply with all laws, rules and regulations, including those applicable to the presentation of the Company s financial information to the public. As a result, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board has adopted this Clawback Policy (this Policy ), which provides for the recovery of certain executive officer incentive-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement. This Policy is adopted pursuant to and intended to comply with Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq so long as the Company s securities are listed on Nasdaq. 2. Administration This Policy will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or in the absence of such a committee a majority of the independent directors (within the meaning of Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2)) serving on the Board (the Committee ). Except as limited by law, the Committee will have full power, authority, and sole and exclusive discretion to construe, interpret and administer this Policy. The Committee will interpret this Policy consistent with Nasdaq Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation) and any Nasdaq guidance issued thereunder, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and any other applicable laws, rules or regulations governing the mandatory recovery of compensation, as such laws, rules or regulations may change, be interpreted or evolve from time to time. Any determinations made by the Committee will be made in its sole discretion and will be final, conclusive and binding on all affected individuals. 3. Covered Executives This Policy will cover the Company s current and former Executive Officers as determined by the Board from time to time in accordance with Rule 16a-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will include the Company s chief executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any executive vice president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division or function (such as sales, administration or finance), any other officer that performs a policy making function for the Company, any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company and Executive Officers of the Company s 

Clawback Policy WaFd, Inc. Clawback Policy Effective 10/2/23 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2023 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 4 subsidiaries if such individuals perform such policy-making functions for the Company, and any other officer whose compensation is determined by the Committee per authorization granted by the Board (collectively, the Covered Executives and each, a Covered Executive ). This Policy will cover the Company s Covered Executives without regard to whether any misconduct occurred or whether a Covered Executive had any responsibility for the erroneous financial statements. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. The identification of an Executive Officer for purposes of this Policy would include at a minimum executive officers identified by the Company pursuant to Item 401(b) of SEC Regulation S-K. 4. Compensation Covered The Policy will apply to all incentive-based compensation paid, granted, earned, vested or otherwise awarded to a Covered Executive, and includes, but is not limited to annual bonuses or incentive compensation, and other short and long term cash incentive awards, stock options, restricted stock awards, performance share awards, and other equity-based awards. Notwithstanding the generality of and in addition to the foregoing, as required under Nasdaq Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation), this Policy will apply to all Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a person (in each case, as such terms are defined below): After beginning service as an Executive Officer of the Company; Who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-Based Compensation; While the Company has a class of securities listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange or a national securities association; and During the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement (as defined below), plus any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years; provided, however, that a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months would be deemed a completed fiscal year; and provided, further, that the Company s obligation to recover erroneously awarded compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed. For purposes of this Policy, a Restatement means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 

Clawback Policy WaFd, Inc. Clawback Policy Effective 10/2/23 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2023 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 5 For purpose of determining the relevant recovery period, the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement is the earlier to occur of: (i) the date the Company s Board, a committee of the Board or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement; or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement. 5. Authority and Obligation to Recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation In the event of a Restatement and if required under Nasdaq Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation), the Company must reasonably promptly recover any Erroneously Awarded Compensation (as defined below) in compliance with this Policy and Nasdaq Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation), except to the extent one of the three conditions below is met and the Committee has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable. (A) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered and the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation, has documented such reasonable attempt(s) to recover and provided that documentation to Nasdaq. (B) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022 and the Company has obtained an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation and has provided such opinion to Nasdaq. (C) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or 411(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder. The term Erroneously Awarded Compensation as used in this Policy means that amount of Incentive- Based Compensation Received (as such terms are defined below) that exceeds the amount of Incentive- Based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts and must be computed without regard to any taxes paid. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement, the amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-based Compensation 

Clawback Policy WaFd, Inc. Clawback Policy Effective 10/2/23 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2023 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 6 was Received. The Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq. The term Incentive-Based Compensation as used in this Policy means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure. The term Financial Reporting Measures as used in this Policy means measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Financial reporting measures include, without limitation, stock price and total shareholder return, and may include non-GAAP financial measures. A financial reporting measure need not be presented within the Company s financial statements or included in an SEC filing to constitute a financial reporting measure for this purpose. Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed Received as such term is used in this Policy by an Executive Officer in the Company s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, Incentive-Based Compensation is intended to be interpreted and construed broadly and includes with respect to any plan that takes into account incentive- based compensation (other than a tax-qualified plan) any amount contributed to a notional account based on erroneously awarded compensation and any earnings accrued to date on that notional account. Such plans include without limitation long-term disability plans, life insurance plans, supplemental executive retirement plans and other compensation, if it is based on incentive-based compensation. 6. Method of Recovery The Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recovering Incentive Compensation or Erroneously Awarded Compensation hereunder, which may include, without limitation, any one or more of the following: requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid; seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer or other disposition of any equity-based awards; cancelling or rescinding some or all outstanding vested or unvested equity-based awards; adjusting or withholding from unpaid compensation or other set-off; cancelling or setting-off against planned future grants of equity-based awards; and/or any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. 

Clawback Policy WaFd, Inc. Clawback Policy Effective 10/2/23 CONFIDENTIAL PROPRIETARY 2023 WaFd Bank. All rights reserved. Page 7 7. Enforceability In addition to the adoption of this Policy, the Company will take steps to implement an agreement to this Policy by all Covered Executives. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Covered Executives subject to this Policy is required to sign and return to the Company the Acknowledgement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A pursuant to which such Covered Executive will agree to be bound by the terms and comply with this Policy. 8. Policy Not Exclusive Any recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, incentive or equity compensation plan or award or other agreement and any other legal rights or remedies available to the Company.
