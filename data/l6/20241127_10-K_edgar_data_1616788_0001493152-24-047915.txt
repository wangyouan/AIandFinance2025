to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. There is no cumulative voting with respect to
the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50 of the shares voting for the election of directors can elect
all of the directors then up for election. 

The
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds
legally available therefore. In the event we have liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to
share ratably in all assets remaining which are available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision has

On
November 27, 2024, the last sales price per share of our common stock was 2.0 per share. 

The
SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called penny stocks to be an equity security that has a market price
less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If our common stock becomes
a penny stock, we may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the Penny Stock Rule. This rule imposes additional
sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited
investors (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding 200,000, or 300,000 together
with their spouses). For transactions covered by the Penny Stock Rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination
for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may
affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in
the secondary market. 

For
any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure
schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are
required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stock. 

There
can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock
were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority
to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the
public interest. 

6 

Shareholders 

As
of November 27, 2024, there are 50,315,064 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding held by 37 shareholders of record. 

Dividend
Policy 

We
have never paid any cash dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. Our future dividend policy will be determined
by our Board of Directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including our financial condition and performance, our cash needs
and expansion plans, income tax consequences and the restrictions that applicable laws and other arrangements then impose. 

Securities
Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans 

There
are 5,000,000 shares authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans, none of which have been issued. 

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities 

None.

ITEM

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You
should read the following plan of operation together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual
report. This plan of operation contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. The actual results
may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. 

Plan
of Operation 

Legacy
Ventures International, Inc. Legacy or the Company ), was incorporated on March 4, 2014 under the laws of
the State of Nevada. The Company currently has no ongoing operations except for the incurring of general and administrative expenditures. 

On
December 27, 2023, the Company incorporate Ever Green Living Ventures Ltd, a company incorporated in Hong Kong. The Company owns
100 of Ever Green Living Ventures Ltd. The Company plans to engage in Biotech research development and health care research
 development through its wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. 

Results
of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 

Operating
expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2024, was 64,291 compared with 61,943 for the year ended June 30, 2023. Operating
expenses were similar in both period which arise from professional fee charged by auditor, transfer agent and consultant. 

Other
income. There was other income of 5 for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared with the other income of 64 for the year ended June
30, 2023. Other income arises from exchange gain for both periods. 

Net
loss. Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2024, was 64,286, compared with net loss of 61,879 for the year ended June 30, 2023. 

8 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of June 30, 2024, the Company s primary source of liquidity consisted of 842 (June 30, 2023 - 2,187) in cash and prepayment.
The Company financed its operations through a combination of advances from a shareholder. 

The
Company has sustained net losses which have resulted in a total stockholders deficiency at June 30, 2024, and is currently experiencing
a shortfall in operating capital which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
Company anticipates a net loss for the year ending June 30, 2024 and with the expected cash requirements for the coming months, without
additional cash inflows from a corporate transaction, there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue operations. 

We
may seek to secure additional debt or equity capital to finance substantial business development initiatives. There is presently no agreement
in place with any source of financing for the Company and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise any additional
funds, or that such funds will be available on acceptable terms. Funds raised through future equity financing will likely be substantially
dilutive to current shareholders. Lack of additional funds will materially affect the Company and its business, and may cause the Company
to cease operations. Consequently, shareholders could incur a loss of their entire investment in the Company. 

9 

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

During
the year ended June 30, 2024, cash used in operations was 70,475 and 44,034 for the year ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Cash used
in operating activities was primarily the result of net loss from operations. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

There
was no cash used in or provided from investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

There
was cash provided by financing activities of 69,639 and 24,695, respectively for the year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, as a result
of the advances from a shareholder and a director. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or
capital resources that is material to investors. 

Personnel 

The
Company has no full-time employees, but utilizes other project-based contract personnel to carry out the Company s business. We
utilize contract personnel on a continuous basis, primarily in connection with the filing of reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission which require a high level of specialization for one or more of the service components offered. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the current year, the Company has, an accumulated deficit of 6,571,672 as of
June 30, 2024 (June 30, 2023 - 6,507,386). The Company s continued existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute
its operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. These conditions cast substantial doubt on the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will
be available on terms acceptable to the Company, in which case the Company may be unable to meet its obligations. Should the Company
be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, the net realizable value of its assets
may be materially less than the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability of recorded asset amounts that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. 

10 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

In
December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting polices in the Management Discussion
and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a
company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often
as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following accounting
policies currently fit this definition. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and are expressed in United States dollars USD ). All material inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The
Company s fiscal year-end is June 30. The Company s functional currency is USD and the Company s reporting currency
is USD. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis that the Company is a going concern. The going concern assumption
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

Cash 

Cash
includes cash balances with banks or with third parties. 

Income
(Loss) Per Share 

The
Company has adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Topic 260-10 which provides for calculation
of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by
dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted income (loss) per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the income (loss) of an entity. Diluted
income (loss) per share exclude all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. All dilutive common share equivalents
were anti-dilutive for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Foreign
Currency Translation 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange
rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate on the date of
the transaction. All exchange gains or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in net income
(loss) for the year. 

The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars US ). The Company s subsidiary in Hong Kong maintains
its books and record in Hong Kong Dollars HK ), and HK is functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic
environment in which the entity operates. 

In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not the US are translated
into US , in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation
of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the
statement of stockholders equity. 

Translation
of amounts from HK into US 1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods: 

As of and for the year ended June 30, 2024 
 
 Period-end HK : US 1 exchange rate 
 7.8 
 
 Period-average HK : US 1 exchange rate 
 7.8 

11 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

ASC
Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the exchange
price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market
for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes
a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level
 1 - 
 Valuation
 based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
 2 - 
 Valuation
 based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. 

Level
 3 - 
 Valuation
 based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring management s best estimate
 of what market participants would use as fair value. 

In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

Related
party balances and transactions 

A
related party is generally defined as: 

(i) 
 any
 person that holds the Company s securities including such person s immediate families, 

(ii) 
 the
 Company s management, 

(iii) 
 someone
 that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Company, or 

(iv) 
 anyone
 who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company. 

A
transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Company provides for federal and provincial income
taxes payable, as well as for those deferred because of the timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement
purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recoverable or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or
expense in the period of the change. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 

The
Company adopted the FASB guidance concerning accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which clarifies the accounting and disclosure
for uncertainty in tax positions, as of July 1, 2017. The guidance requires that the Company determine whether it is more likely than
not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority. If a tax position does not meet the
more likely than not recognition criterion, the guidance requires that the tax position be measured at the largest amount of benefit
greater than 50 percent not likely of being sustained upon ultimate settlement. Based on the Company s evaluation, management has
concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the financial statements.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

Material Uncertainty Related to Going concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred substantial losses during the year, and has a working capital deficit, which
raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regards to these matters are described
in Note 2. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The critical audit matters are matters
arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (ii) involved our especially
challenging, subjective or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

. The Company owns of Ever Green Living Ventures Ltd. The Company plans to engage in Biotech research development
and health care research development through its wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. 

(June 30, 2023 - ), and an accumulated deficit of (June 30, 2023 - ). The Company s continued
existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance
that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, in which case
the Company may be unable to meet its obligations. Should the Company be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in
the normal course of business, the net realizable value of its assets may be materially less than the amounts recorded in the audited
financial statements. The audited financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded asset
amounts that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.

are recorded in bank and other charges in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss and accounts payable and accrued liabilities
in the balance sheets.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures 
(as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by
this annual report, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective at a reasonable assurance level based
on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision
of, our principal executive, principal accounting and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

14 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the framework in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as the COSO- 2013
criteria. Based on the assessment performed, management believes that as of June 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting
was not effective based upon the COSO-2013 criteria. Additionally, based on management s assessment, we determined that there were
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Controls 

During
the year ended June 30, 2024, there was no change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Term
of Office 

Our
Directors are appointed for a one year term to hold office until the next annual general meeting of our shareholders or until removed
from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our officers are appointed by our Board of Directors and hold office until removed by the
board. 

Family
Relationships 

There
are no family relationships between or among the directors, executive officers or persons nominated or chosen by the Company to become
directors or executive officers. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

To
the best of our knowledge, during the past ten years, none of the following occurred with respect to a present or former director, executive
officer, or employee: (1) any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive
officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (2) any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being
subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (3) being subject to any order, judgment
or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining,
barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his or her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; and (4) being
found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to have violated
a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated. 

17 

Committees
of the Board 

We
do not currently have a compensation committee, executive committee, or stock plan committee. 

Audit
Committee 

We
do not have a separately-designated standing audit committee. The entire Board of Directors performs the functions of an audit committee,
but no written charter governs the actions of the Board when performing the functions of what would generally be performed by an audit
committee. The Board approves the selection of our independent accountants and meets and interacts with the independent accountants to
discuss issues related to financial reporting. In addition, the Board reviews the scope and results of the audit with the independent
accountants, reviews with management and the independent accountants our annual operating results, considers the adequacy of our internal
accounting procedures and considers other auditing and accounting matters including fees to be paid to the independent auditor and the
performance of the independent auditor. Our Board of Directors, which performs the functions of an audit committee, does not have a member
who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert within the definition of Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Nomination
Committee 

Our
Board of Directors does not maintain a nominating committee. As a result, no written charter governs the director nomination process.
Our size and the size of our Board, at this time, do not require a separate nominating committee. 

When
evaluating director nominees, our directors consider the following factors: 

- 
 The
 appropriate size of our Board of Directors; 
 
 - 
 Our
 needs with respect to the particular talents and experience of our directors; 
 
 - 
 The
 knowledge, skills and experience of nominees, including experience in finance, administration or public service, in light of prevailing
 business conditions and the knowledge, skills and experience already possessed by other members of the Board; 

18 

- 
 Experience
 in political affairs; 
 
 - 
 Experience
 with accounting rules and practices; and 
 
 - 
 The
 desire to balance the benefit of continuity with the periodic injection of the fresh perspective provided by new Board members. 

Our
goal is to assemble a Board that brings together a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business and professional
experience. In doing so, the Board will also consider candidates with appropriate non-business backgrounds. 

Other
than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although the Board may also consider such other factors
as it may deem are in our best interests as well as our stockholders. In addition, the Board identifies nominees by first evaluating
the current members of the Board willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience that are relevant
to our business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination. If any member of the Board does not wish
to continue in service or if the Board decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, the Board then identifies the desired skills
and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria above. Current members of the Board are polled for suggestions as to individuals
meeting the criteria described above. The Board may also engage in research to identify qualified individuals. To date, we have not engaged
third parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying potential nominees, although we reserve the right in the future to retain
a third party search firm, if necessary. The Board does not typically consider shareholder nominees because it believes that its current
nomination process is sufficient to identify directors who serve our best interests. 

Code
of Ethics 

As
of June 30, 2024, we had not adopted a Code of Ethics for Financial Executives, which would include our principal executive officer,
principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions.

During
the year ended June 30, 2024, Wei TJONG and Hoi Sau KOO advanced 68,357 and 1,282, respectively, for operating expenses 

Amounts
due to Wei TJONG as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, were 104,525 and 36,168, respectively. 

Amounts
due to Hoi Sau KOO as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, were 1,282 and nil, respectively. 

The
owing to Wei TJONG and Hoi Sau KOO consists of working capital advances and borrowings. These amounts are due on demand and are non-interest
bearing. 

Director
Independence 

We
adhere to the NASDAQ listing standards in determining whether a director is independent. Our board of directors consults with its counsel
to ensure that the board s determinations are consistent with those rules and all relevant securities and other laws and regulations
regarding the independence of directors. The NASDAQ listing standards define an independent director as a person, other
than an executive officer of a company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the issuer s board
of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

nominating or audit committee.
