 PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Company Description and Development of the Business 
 The discussion below describes the business conducted by The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, an Ohio corporation Scotts Miracle-Gro and, together with its subsidiaries, the Company, we, our or us ), including general developments in our business during fiscal 2024. Each reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K Form 10-K to a fiscal year is to our fiscal year ended or ending, as applicable, on September 30 of the referenced year. For additional information on recent business developments, see ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS of this Form 10-K. 
 Through our U.S. Consumer and Other segments, we are the leading manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden products in North America. Our products are marketed under some of the most recognized brand names in the consumer lawn and garden industry. Our key consumer lawn and garden brands include Scotts Turf Builder lawn fertilizer and Scotts grass seed products; Miracle-Gro soil, plant food and gardening products; Ortho herbicide and pesticide products; and Tomcat rodent control and animal repellent products. We are the exclusive agent of Monsanto Company, a subsidiary of Bayer AG Monsanto ), for the marketing and distribution of certain of Monsanto s consumer Roundup 1 branded products within the United States U.S. and certain other specified countries. In addition, we have an equity interest in Bonnie Plants, LLC, a joint venture with Alabama Farmers Cooperative, Inc. AFC ), focused on planting, growing, developing, distributing, marketing and selling live plants. 
 Through our Hawthorne segment, we are a leading provider of nutrients, lighting and other materials used for indoor and hydroponic gardening in North America. Our key brands include General Hydroponics , Gavita , Botanicare , Agrolux , Gro Pro , Mother Earth , Grower s Edge , HydroLogic Purification System and CYCO . 
 Scotts Miracle-Gro traces its heritage to a company founded by O.M. Scott in Marysville, Ohio in 1868. In the mid-1900s, we became widely known for the development of quality lawn fertilizers and grass seeds that led to the creation of a new industry consumer lawn care. In the 1990s, we significantly expanded our product offering with three leading brands in the U.S. home lawn and garden industry. In fiscal 1995, through a merger with Stern s Miracle-Gro Products, Inc., which was founded by Horace Hagedorn and Otto Stern in Long Island, New York in 1951, we acquired the Miracle-Gro brand, the industry leader in water-soluble garden plant foods. In fiscal 1999, we acquired the Ortho brand in the U.S. and obtained exclusive rights to market Monsanto s consumer Roundup brand within the U.S. and other contractually specified countries, thereby adding industry-leading weed, pest and disease control products to our portfolio. Today, the Scotts , Turf Builder , Miracle-Gro , Ortho and Roundup brands make us the most widely recognized company in the consumer lawn and garden industry in the U.S. 
 Business Segments 
 We divide our business into the following reportable segments: 
 U.S. Consumer 
 Hawthorne 
 Other 
 U.S. Consumer consists of our consumer lawn and garden business in the United States. Hawthorne consists of our indoor and hydroponic gardening business. Other primarily consists of our consumer lawn and garden business in Canada. This division of reportable segments is consistent with how the segments report to and are managed by our Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker of the Company). In addition, Corporate consists of general and administrative expenses and certain other income and expense items not allocated to the reportable business segments. Financial information about these segments for each of the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is presented in NOTE 20. SEGMENT INFORMATION of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.

The Company also performs other services on behalf of Monsanto, including manufacturing conversion services, pursuant to ancillary agreements. For additional details regarding the Third Restated Agreement, see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business In the event the Third Restated Agreement for Monsanto s consumer Roundup products terminates or Monsanto s consumer Roundup business materially declines, we would lose a substantial source of future earnings and overhead expense absorption in this Form 10-K and NOTE 6. MARKETING AGREEMENT of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. 
 Acquisitions and Divestitures 
 There were no material acquisitions or divestitures during fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023. Refer to NOTE 7. ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for more information regarding fiscal 2022 acquisitions. 
 Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution 
 We sell our products through our direct sales force, e-commerce website and network of brokers and distributors primarily to home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, garden centers, e-commerce platforms, food and drug stores, indoor gardening and hydroponic product distributors, retailers and growers.

Table of Contents 

 The majority of our shipments to customers are made via common carriers or through distributors in the U.S. We primarily utilize third parties to manage the key distribution centers for our consumer lawn and garden business, which are strategically located across the U.S. and Canada. Growing media products are generally shipped direct-to-store without passing through a distribution center. 
 Raw Materials 
 We purchase raw materials for our products from various sources. We are subject to market risk as a result of the fluctuating prices of raw materials, including urea and other fertilizer inputs, resins, diesel, gasoline, natural gas, sphagnum peat, bark and grass seed. Our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply, minimize costs and improve supply and pricing predictability. We seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors. When appropriate, we commit to purchase a certain percentage of our needs in advance of the lawn and garden season to secure pre-determined prices. We also hedge certain commodities, particularly diesel and urea, to improve cost predictability and control. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal 2024. 
 Trademarks, Patents, Trade Secrets and Licenses 
 We believe that our trademarks, patents, trade secrets and licenses provide us with significant competitive advantages. We pursue a vigorous trademark protection strategy consisting of registration, renewal and maintenance of key trademarks and proactive monitoring and enforcement activities to protect against infringement. The Scotts , Miracle-Gro , Ortho , Tomcat , Hyponex , Earthgro , General Hydroponics , Gavita , Botanicare , Agrolux and Mother Earth brand names and logos, as well as a number of product trademarks, including Turf Builder , EZ Seed , Organic Choice , Home Defense Max , Nature Scapes , and Weed B Gon Max are registered in the United States and/or internationally and are considered material to our business. 
 In addition, we actively develop and maintain an extensive portfolio of utility and design patents covering a variety of subject matters and technologies relevant to the business such as fertilizer, weed killer, chemical and growing media compositions and processes; grass seed varieties; mechanical dispensing devices such as applicators, spreaders and sprayers; lighting applications; and hydroponic growing systems. Our utility patents provide protection generally extending to 20 years from the date of filing, and some of our patents will continue well into the next decade. We also hold exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses and supply arrangements permitting the use and sale of additional patented fertilizers, pesticides, electrical and mechanical devices. Although our portfolio of trade secrets, patents and patent licenses is important to our success, no single trade secret, patent or group of related patents, alone, is considered critical to the operation of any of our business segments or the business as a whole. 
 Seasonality and Backlog 
 Our North America consumer lawn and garden business is highly seasonal, with approximately 75 of our annual net sales occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters combined. Our annual net sales for this business are further concentrated in our second and third fiscal quarters by retailers who rely on our ability to deliver products closer to when consumers buy our products. We anticipate significant orders for our North America consumer lawn and garden business for the upcoming spring season will start to be received late in the winter and continue through the spring season. Historically, substantially all orders have been received and shipped within the same fiscal year with minimal carryover of open orders at the end of the fiscal year. 
 Our Hawthorne segment is also impacted by seasonal sales patterns for certain product categories due to the timing of growing patterns in North America during our second and third fiscal quarters, and the timing of certain controlled agricultural lighting project sales during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. 
 Significant Customers 
 The Home Depot and Lowe s are our two largest customers and are the only customers that individually represent more than 10 of reported consolidated net sales during any of the three most recent fiscal years. For additional details regarding significant customers, see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers, the loss of one or more of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any of our top customers, or a material reduction in the inventory of our products that they carry, could adversely affect our financial results of this Form 10-K and NOTE 20. SEGMENT INFORMATION of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. 
 Competitive Marketplace 
 The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of brand strength, product innovation, product quality, product performance, advertising, value, supply chain competency, field sales support, in-store sales support and the strength of our relationships with major retailers and distributors.

Table of Contents 

 In the lawn and garden, pest control and indoor gardening and hydroponic markets, our products compete against private label as well as branded products. Primary competitors include Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc., Central Garden Pet Company, Kellogg Garden Products, Oldcastle Retail, Inc., Lebanon Seaboard Corporation, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, FoxFarm Soil Fertilizer Company, Nanolux Technology, Inc., Sun Gro Horticulture, Inc., Advanced Nutrients, Ltd., SBM Life Science Corp., Woodstream Corporation, Sunday Lawn Care and Hydrofarm Holdings Group, Inc. In addition, we face competition from smaller regional competitors that operate in many of the areas where we compete. 
 In Canada, we face competition in the lawn and garden market from Premier Tech Ltd. and a variety of local companies including private label brands. 
 Research and Development 
 We continually invest in research and development to design new or improve existing product formulae and packaging, as well as to streamline our manufacturing processes. Spending on research and development was 34.6 million, 35.7 million and 45.3 million in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, including product registration costs of 9.0 million, 12.4 million and 13.0 million, respectively. In addition to our own research and development activities, we actively seek ways to leverage the research and development activities of our suppliers and other business partners. 
 Regulatory Considerations 
 Laws and regulations in the United States and other countries affect the manufacture, sale, distribution, use and/or application of our products in several ways. For example, in the United States, all pesticide products must comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act FIFRA ), and most pesticide products require registration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the U.S. EPA and similar state agencies before they can be sold or distributed. The use of certain pesticide products is also regulated by the U.S. EPA in addition to various local, state and federal environmental and/or public health agencies. These regulations may restrict or ban the use of certain ingredients or categories of products altogether. Analogous regulatory regimes apply to certain pesticides that we sell or distribute in other countries. 
 Fertilizer and growing media products are also subject to various laws and regulations, some of which require registration, mandate labeling requirements, and/or govern the sale and distribution of the products. Our grass seed products are regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Seed Act and various state regulations. In addition, governmental agencies regulate the disposal, transport, handling and storage of waste, the remediation of contaminated sites, air and water discharges from our facilities, and workplace health and safety. 
 Governmental authorities generally require operating facilities to obtain permits (sometimes on an annual basis) relating to site-specific conditions and/or activities. For example, permits must be obtained in order to harvest peat and to discharge storm water run-off or water pumped from peat deposits. The permits typically specify the condition in which the property must be left after the peat is fully harvested, with the residual use typically being natural wetland habitats combined with open water areas. We are generally required by these permits to limit our harvesting and to restore the property consistent with the intended residual use. In some locations, these facilities have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water. 
 In addition, in 2021 the Biden Administration announced a multi-agency plan to address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS contamination nationwide. Agencies, including the U.S. EPA, the Department of Defense, the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services, will take actions to prevent the release of PFAS into the air, drinking systems, and food supply and to expand cleanup efforts to remediate the impacts of PFAS pollution. As part of this announcement, the U.S. EPA released its PFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA s Commitments to Action 2021-2024, which sets timelines by which the U.S. EPA plans to take specific actions during the Biden Administration. Further, many states have taken action to address PFAS concerns ranging from appropriation legislation to funding scientific research, bans on certain categories of consumer products containing PFAS and/or broad prohibitions on PFAS across all products. Complicating this patchwork of state regulation is that various jurisdictions may define PFAS differently. It is possible, therefore, that some of these actions will have an impact direct or indirect on our business. 
 Packaging has also become subject to increased governmental scrutiny in many states. Specifically, state legislation is seeking to reduce single use plastics and establish extended producer responsibility programs, which are designed to bolster the recycling industry by transferring the cost of packaging disposal to the manufacturers. Extended producer responsibility programs typically include targets and reporting responsibilities for, among other things, post-consumer recycling usage, compostable packaging, material reduction and refill strategies. 
 The expansion of our business may expand the regulatory oversight to which we are subject. If we enter new product categories and/or new jurisdictions, we may become subject to additional applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

 For more information regarding how compliance with local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations may affect us, see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Regulation of Our Company Compliance with environmental and other public health regulations or changes in such regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to market all of our products of this Form 10-K. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to various regulatory proceedings, none of which are expected to be material to our business. At September 30, 2024, 2.6 million was accrued for environmental matters. During fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we expensed 0.1 million, 0.4 million and 0.2 million, respectively, for such environmental matters. We had no material capital expenditures during the last three fiscal years related to environmental or regulatory matters. 
 Human Capital 
 We believe our culture and commitment to our associates provides unique value to us and our shareholders. Every associate, and every job, is important to our success and helping us achieve our purpose. We seek to create an environment that values the health, safety and wellness of our teams, and we work to equip them with the knowledge and skills to serve our business and develop in their careers. 
 This discussion includes information regarding human capital matters that we believe may be of interest to shareholders generally. We recognize that certain other stakeholders (such as customers, associates and non-governmental organizations) may be interested in more detailed information on these topics. We encourage you to review the Supporting Our People section of our 2024 Corporate Responsibility Report, located on our website at https://scottsmiraclegro.com/responsibility/environmental-social-and-governance, for more detailed information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives. The contents of our corporate website are not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 
 Associates 
 As of September 30, 2024, we employed approximately 5,300 associates. During peak sales and production periods in fiscal 2024, our workforce totaled approximately 7,100, comprised of approximately 6,200 associates including seasonal associates and approximately 900 in temporary labor. Included within these numbers, during fiscal 2024, we employed a total of approximately 2,500 full-time and seasonal in-store associates within the United States to help our retail partners merchandise our products in their lawn and garden departments directly to consumers. 
 Engagement 
 Our success depends on the engagement of our associates. To drive engagement, we take a purposeful approach focused on enhancing the associate experience centering on creating a positive workplace and fostering trust in leadership. 
 We recognize that two-way communication enhances trust and improves collaboration and overall engagement. We gather associate feedback both formally and informally throughout the year through such initiatives as pulse surveys, leadership meetings and roundtable discussions. In fiscal 2024, we surveyed our global associate population on topics spanning the employee experience. Categories included positive workplace, strong leadership, health well-being, meaningful work, growth opportunity, trust in the organization and ethics. Engagement surveys provide us with insight into what we are doing well and where we have opportunities to improve. Results from the fiscal 2024 Associate Experience Survey highlighted focus areas for fiscal 2024 and beyond. Another source of associate sentiment comes from exit interviews, when we ask for ratings, rankings and feedback from all salaried associates who voluntarily leave our organization. These valuable inputs are shared with senior leadership and integrated into practice as human capital initiatives are deployed. 
 We believe that an informed workforce contributes to an engaged workforce. As such, we have prioritized ensuring our associates have access to the information they need to understand the business decisions being made, the reasons behind them and how changes will impact them in their role. Recognizing there is significant value in hearing directly from our leadership team, we continue to host Town Hall meetings each quarter to disseminate enterprise-wide information and to allow for interactive communication. 
 Diversity 
 We value our associates diversity and encourage them to leverage their varied life experiences at our Company. This includes diversity in terms of gender, sexuality, race, thoughts, interests, languages, beliefs and more.

Table of Contents 

 Our employee resource groups ERGs are voluntary, associate-led groups typically formed by people with a common affinity such as gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, military status or other attributes. Each ERG establishes a mission to positively impact the business by cultivating relationships through networking and developing talent through experiences, programs and mentoring. Our ERGs drive continuous improvement of our inclusive work environment and are open to all associates. Our ERGs consist of the Scotts Associate Board, Scotts Associates For A Greener Earth, the Scotts Black Employees Network, the Scotts Christian Fellowship, Scotts Gro-Masters, Scotts GroPride, the Scotts Veterans Network, the Scotts Women s Network and the Scotts Young Professionals. 
 Professional Development 
 We view development and retention of our associates as valuable components of our business operations and critical to creating a culture of leadership throughout our Company. Our associates have the opportunity to learn new skills through exposure and involvement in business challenges. Our managers support associates as development happens on the job through cross-functional team assignments, expanded roles and rotational assignments. Our ongoing development processes are designed to grow knowledge, improve skills and capabilities, and achieve competence in specific behaviors to meet performance expectations and prepare for potential future roles within our Company. In fiscal 2024, we developed and implemented a leadership development framework for our people leaders, delivering on two key areas leader accountabilities at the Company and critical skill training for our front line leaders. 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 We believe financial health and mental wellness are core components of our associates overall well-being and we are committed to ensuring fair and competitive compensation to our associates based on their roles. Each year we conduct an analysis of our pay and compensation practices, from both an external market and internal consistency perspective, to ensure that our pay decisions are fair and equitable, adjusting as needed. To ensure transparency and understanding of our compensation programs, we have enhanced our education opportunities and communications for our managers and associates. We also prioritize sharing our financial successes with associates through our incentive plans for eligible participants and our profit-sharing program and discretionary bonuses for those who are not incentive eligible. 
 Through our LiveTotal Health program, we demonstrate our commitment to the overall well-being of our associates. In response to feedback from our most recent Associate Experience Survey, we enhanced our benefits to provide more comprehensive mental health support, including a broader range of services and improved access to mental healthcare. This focus on mental well-being is complemented by our suite of benefits, designed to meet the diverse needs of our workforce. Our offerings include healthcare coverage, family leave, 401(k) matching, and other essential benefits that support both our associates and their families. Additionally, we provide tailored benefits such as a discounted stock purchase plan, healthcare navigation and advocacy concierge services, structured reimbursement for adoption and surrogacy expenses, a Marysville onsite fitness facility, and limited reimbursement for well-being expenses. 
 Health and Safety 
 We maintain several health and safety programs to protect our team members, including our comprehensive Environmental Health and Safety EHS management system. All associates and business partners, including contractors, are covered by our EHS management system. Our associates are encouraged to participate in safety committees to spur associate engagement with safety on a local and national level. To further manage health and safety risks, we develop compliance calendars that highlight dates for health and safety inspections and deadlines to meet voluntary and regulatory requirements. We use an EHS scorecard composed of leading and lagging indicators to evaluate our health and safety performance including progress measurements for safety training, behavioral-based safety observations, near-miss reporting, total recordable incident rate and lost time accident rate.

 Environmental, Social and Governance 
 Our stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, suppliers, associates, communities as well as the environment and society, are essential to our business. We endeavor to make our workforce more inclusive, our business more sustainable, and our communities more engaged by maintaining strong environmental, social and governance ESG practices. In fiscal 2024, we published our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, prepared in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative Standards (2021) and with consideration for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board s Chemicals industry standard. The report maps our sustainability efforts to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and provides detailed information regarding our ESG strategy, focus areas and governance structure. The Company s ESG focus areas are Product Stewardship and Safety, Operations and Supply Chain, Associate Engagement and Wellness, Community Engagement and Governance and Transparency. The Company continues to benchmark, set and make progress towards goals and seek continuous improvement around these focus areas. 
 We publish our Corporate Responsibility Report and several ESG-related policies and statements on the ESG section of our corporate website, which is located at https://scottsmiraclegro.com/responsibility/environmental-social-and-governance. These policies and statements address environmental, health and safety and human rights concerns. We maintain a Supplier Code of Conduct that establishes the minimum standards that suppliers must satisfy to sell goods to or do business with the Company. Further ESG initiatives in fiscal 2024 included responding to the Carbon Disclosure Project s climate change and water questionnaires. The contents of our corporate website are not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.

 Risks Related to Our Business 
 If we underestimate or overestimate demand for our products and do not maintain appropriate inventory levels, our net sales and/or working capital could be negatively impacted. 
 Our ability to manage our inventory levels to meet our customers demand for our products is important for our business. Our production levels and inventory management goals for our products are based on estimates of demand, taking into account production capacity, timing of shipments, and inventory levels. Due to a number of factors, including manufacturing lead-times, seasonal purchasing patterns, and the potential for material price increases, we may carry additional inventory and increase our working capital and related financing requirements. This may increase our warehousing costs or result in excess inventory that may become difficult to manage, unusable or obsolete and adversely impact our ability to realize anticipated returns from product sales. If we overestimate or underestimate either channel or retail demand for any of our products during a given season, we may not maintain appropriate inventory levels, which could negatively impact our net sales, profit margins, net earnings, working capital and/or cash flow, hinder our ability to meet customer demand, result in loss of customers, or cause us to incur excess and obsolete inventory charges or excess warehouse storage costs. 
 An economic downturn and economic uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products. 
 We have observed increased economic uncertainty in the U.S. including the potential for an economic recession. Impacts of such general economic weakness include, without limitation: reduced credit availability; reduced liquidity; volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets; bankruptcies and rising interest rates. In addition, consumers may reduce discretionary spending during periods of economic uncertainty, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin products. Adverse economic conditions have included or resulted, and could continue to include or result, in a significant increase in inflation, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, including our operating margins. Continued high inflation has had a negative impact on our operating margins in recent periods including, for example, through persistently high manufacturing costs. 
 Disruptions in availability or increases in the prices of raw materials, fuel or transportation costs could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We source many of our commodities and other raw materials on a global basis. The general availability and price of those raw materials can be affected by numerous forces beyond our control, including political instability, trade restrictions and other government regulations, duties and tariffs, price controls, changes in currency exchange rates and weather. A significant disruption in the availability or price of any of our key raw materials could negatively impact our business. 
 Increases in the prices of key commodities and other raw materials could adversely affect our ability to manage our cost structure. Market conditions may limit our ability to raise selling prices to offset increases in our raw material costs. Further, sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers and/or consumers may decide not to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share. Our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our proprietary technologies can limit our ability to locate or utilize alternative inputs for certain products. For certain inputs, new sources of supply may have to be qualified under regulatory standards, which can require additional investment and delay bringing a product to market. We utilize hedge agreements periodically to fix the prices of a portion of our urea and fuel needs. The hedge agreements are designed to mitigate the earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with the costs of urea and fuel. In periods of declining prices, utilizing these hedge agreements may effectively increase our expenditures for these raw materials. 
 Because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers, the loss of one or more of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any of our top customers, or a material reduction in the inventory of our products that they carry, could adversely affect our financial results. 
 Our top two retail customers, The Home Depot and Lowe s, together accounted for 48 of our fiscal 2024 net sales and 18 of our outstanding accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024. The loss of, or reduction in orders from any major customer for any reason (including, for example, changes in a retailer s strategy, reduction in inventories of our products that they maintain, claims or allegations that our products or products we market on behalf of third parties are unsafe, a decline in consumer demand, regulatory, legal or other external pressures or a change in marketing strategy), and customer disputes regarding shipments, fees, merchandise condition or related matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our inability to collect accounts receivable from one of our major customers, or a significant deterioration in the financial condition of one of these customers, including a bankruptcy filing or a liquidation, could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Table of Contents 

 We do not have long-term sales agreements with, or other contractual assurances as to future sales to, any of our major retail customers. In addition, continued consolidation in the retail industry has resulted in an increasingly concentrated retail base, and as a result, we are significantly dependent upon sales to key retailers who have significant bargaining strength. To the extent such concentration continues to occur, our net sales and income from operations may be increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of, or other adverse developments involving our relationship with, one or more of our key customers. In addition, our business may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailers, such as inventory reductions, limitations on access to shelf space, price demands and other conditions. 
 We may not successfully develop new product lines and products or improve existing product lines and products. 
 Our future success depends on creating and successfully competing in markets for our products including our ability to improve our existing product lines and products and to develop and manufacture new product lines and products to meet evolving consumer needs. We cannot provide any assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new product lines and products or product innovations that satisfy consumer needs or achieve market acceptance, or that we will develop, manufacture and market new product lines and products or product innovations in a timely manner. If we fail to successfully develop and manufacture new product lines and products or product innovations, our ability to maintain or grow our market share may be adversely affected, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the development and introduction of new product lines and products and product innovations require substantial research and development expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup if such new product lines, products or innovations do not achieve market acceptance. 
 Many of the products we manufacture and market contain active ingredients that are subject to regulatory approval. The need to obtain such approval could delay the launch of new products or product innovations that contain active ingredients or otherwise prevent us from developing and manufacturing certain products and product innovations. 
 Our marketing activities may not be successful. 
 We invest substantial resources in advertising, consumer promotions and other marketing activities to maintain, extend and expand our brand image. Negative publicity about us or our brands, including publicity regarding product safety, quality, efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and matters related to climate impact and waste management) and other sustainability or similar issues, whether real or perceived, could occur and could be widely and rapidly disseminated, including through the use of social media sites. There can be no assurances that our marketing strategies will be effective or that the amount we invest in advertising activities will result in a corresponding increase in sales of our products. If our marketing initiatives are unsuccessful, including our ability to leverage digital media and social networks to reach existing and potential customers or our brands suffer damage to reputation due to real or perceived quality issues (which damage can be quickly multiplied by social media), we will have incurred significant expenses without the benefit of higher revenues. 
 The highly competitive nature of our markets could adversely affect our ability to maintain or grow revenues. 
 Each of our operating segments participates in highly competitive markets. Our products compete against national and regional products and private label products produced by various suppliers. Many of our competitors sell their products at prices lower than ours. Our most price sensitive consumers may trade down to lower priced products during challenging economic times or if current economic conditions worsen. We compete primarily on the basis of product innovation, product quality, product performance, value, brand strength, supply chain competency, field sales support, in-store sales support, the strength of our relationships with major retailers and advertising. Some of our competitors have significant financial resources. The strong competition that we face in all of our markets may prevent us from achieving our revenue goals, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our manufacturing operations, including our reliance on third-party manufacturers, could harm our business. 
 We may not be able to maintain or develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing capability and processes that will enable us to meet the quality, price, design and product standards or production volumes required to successfully manufacture our products. Even if we successfully maintain and develop our manufacturing capabilities and processes, we may not be able to do so in time to satisfy the needs of our customers. 
 We rely on third parties to manufacture certain products. This reliance generates a number of risks, including decreased control over the production and related processes, which could lead to production delays or interruptions and inferior product quality control. In addition, performance problems at these third-party manufacturers could lead to cost overruns, shortages or other problems, which could increase our costs of production or result in delivery shortages or delays to our customers. 
 
 10 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, if one or more of our third-party manufacturers becomes insolvent or unwilling to continue to manufacture products of acceptable quality, at acceptable costs and in a timely manner, our ability to deliver products to our retail customers could be significantly impaired. Substitute manufacturers may not be available or, if available, may be unwilling or unable to manufacture the products we need on acceptable terms. Moreover, if customer demand for our products increases, we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current third-party manufacturers, or others, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
 Our business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing outside of the U.S. and risks from tariffs and/or international trade wars. 
 We import many of our raw materials and finished goods from countries outside of the United States, including but not limited to China. Our import operations are subject to complex customs laws, regulations, tax requirements, forced labor laws and trade regulations, such as tariffs set by governments, either through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. Tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly goods from China, have increased the cost of the goods we purchase. Additional tariffs and protectionist duties could be imposed by the U.S. with relatively short notice to us. These governmental actions could have, and any similar future actions may have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The overall effect of these risks is that our costs may increase or we may experience supply disruptions, which in turn may result in lower profitability if we are unable to offset such increases through higher prices, and/or that we may suffer a decline in sales if our customers do not accept price increases. 
 Our reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to our business and adversely affect our financial results. 
 Although we continue to implement risk mitigation strategies for single-source suppliers, we also rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain of our raw materials, product components and other necessary supplies, including certain active ingredients used in our products. If we are unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relationships, if we are unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity and quality levels needed for our business, or if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent or experience other financial distress, we could experience disruptions in production, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 A significant interruption in the operation of our or our suppliers facilities could impact our capacity to produce products and service our customers, which could adversely affect revenues and earnings. 
 Operations at our and our suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including fire, flooding or other natural disasters, disease outbreaks or pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, government shutdowns and work stoppages. A significant interruption in the operation of our or our suppliers facilities could significantly impact our capacity to produce products and service our customers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and financial position, particularly with respect to products that we manufacture at a limited number of facilities, such as our fertilizer and liquid products. 
 In the event of a disaster, our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail, which could adversely interrupt our operations. 
 Our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe, natural disaster, or severe weather, as well as events resulting from unauthorized security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place that are ready to be executed if we encounter a disruptive event. However, we cannot be certain that our plans, or those of third-party service providers we rely on, will be successful in the event of a disaster. If our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially experience material adverse impacts including loss of data, damage to important facilities, disruption to our operations, regulatory intervention, reputational harm and loss of customers. 
 Disruptions to transportation channels that we use to distribute our products may adversely affect our margins and profitability. 
 We may experience disruptions to the transportation channels used to distribute our products, including increased congestion, a lack of transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, import or export controls or delays, and labor disputes or shortages. Disruptions in our trucking capacity may result in reduced sales or increased costs, including the additional use of more expensive or less efficient alternatives to meet demand. Congestion can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies, resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs, reduction in our profitability or reduced sales.

 Climate change and unfavorable weather conditions could adversely impact financial results. 
 Our consumer lawn and garden net sales in any year are susceptible to weather conditions in the markets in which our products are sold. For instance, periods of abnormally wet or dry weather can adversely impact the sale of certain products, while increasing demand for other products making the overall impact on the Company difficult to predict. 
 The effects of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. These changes could over time affect, for example, the availability and cost of raw materials, commodities and energy, which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. 
 Consumers and businesses may independently change their behavior because of concerns regarding the impact of climate change and public perceptions. For example, consumers may elect to garden less frequently than historic patterns due to the unpredictability of weather patterns. Those consumers who are less directly impacted by climate change may also engage in less gardening due to discomfort or concerns about perceptions stemming from the direct impact of climate change on others. Current or potential retail customers may pull back from all or parts of the lawn and garden category in response to softening consumer demand. Also, our ability to finance the development of climate resilient product offerings may suffer if consumers become less engaged in lawn and gardening. 
 Our failure to adequately manage the consumer and retail impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters - including climate change - and/or our reporting of such matters. 
 Certain investors, customers, consumers, associates, governmental authorities and other stakeholders are increasing their focus on corporate citizenship and sustainability matters (including climate changes). From time to time, we communicate certain initiatives, including goals, regarding environmental matters, responsible sourcing and social investments, including pursuant to our Corporate Responsibility Report. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, to achieve such initiatives or goals, or we could fail to fully and accurately report our progress on such initiatives and goals. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. 
 Moreover, there are adopted and proposed international accords and treaties, as well as federal, state and local laws and regulations, that would attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change, including the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. In the event that the U.S. government or foreign governments enact new climate change laws or regulations or make changes to existing laws or regulations, compliance with applicable laws or regulations may result in increased manufacturing costs for our products, such as by requiring investment in new pollution control equipment or changing the ways in which certain of our products are made. Additional compliance burdens could be imposed by laws requiring the collection, measurement and analysis of climate-related data which can be costly, time-consuming, dependent on third-party cooperation and unreliable. Furthermore, methodologies for measuring, tracking and reporting on such matters continue to change over time, which requires our processes and controls for such data to evolve as well. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers, in which case, the costs of raw materials and component parts could increase. We may incur some of these costs directly and others may be passed on to us from our third-party suppliers. 
 Any failure to achieve our goals with respect to corporate citizenship and sustainability matters or a perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to adequately manage the political, legal and regulatory impacts of corporate citizenship or other sustainability matters could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation. 
 Product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
 Due to the highly regulated nature of our products, which are primarily designed for consumer use, we may be required to stop selling, return or recall products due to a variety of potential concerns including suspected or confirmed product contamination, adulteration, product mislabeling or misbranding, tampering, or other deficiencies. Product recalls or voluntary market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time. Adverse attention about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation, discourage consumers from buying our products, or cause production and delivery disruptions that could negatively impact our sales and financial condition. 
 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 We may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our products are alleged to cause damage to property, injury, illness, or death. A significant product liability, legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us, or a significant product recall or voluntary withdrawal, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
 If the perception of our brands or organizational reputation are damaged, our consumers, distributors and retailers may react negatively, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We believe we have built our reputation on the efficacy and safety of our brands. Any incident that erodes consumer affinity for our brands or our business operations could significantly reduce our value and damage our business. For example, negative third-party research or media reports on our product safety or efficacy, whether accurate or not, may adversely affect consumer perceptions, which could cause the value of our brands to suffer and adversely affect our business. We may also be adversely affected by news or other negative publicity, regardless of accuracy, regarding other aspects of our business, such as: 
 public health concerns, illness or safety; 
 the perception of our environmental stewardship and the effects our business has on the environment; 
 security breaches of confidential company, customer or employee information; or 
 employee related claims relating to alleged employment discrimination, health care and benefit issues. 
 As part of our marketing initiatives, we have contracted with certain public figures to market and endorse our products. While we maintain specific selection criteria and are diligent in our efforts to seek out public figures that resonate genuinely and effectively with our consumer audience, the individuals we choose to market and endorse our products may fall into negative favor with the general public. Because our consumers may associate the public figures that market and endorse our products with us, any negative publicity on behalf of such individuals may cause negative publicity about us and our products. This negative publicity could materially and adversely affect our brands and reputation and our revenue and profits. 
 Certain of our products may be purchased for use in new and emerging industries or segments and/or be subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions. 
 We sell products, including hydroponic gardening products, that end users may purchase for use in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis, that may not grow or achieve market acceptance in a manner that we can predict. The demand for these products depends on the uncertain growth of these industries or segments. For example, our Hawthorne segment sales volume has decreased due to an oversupply of cannabis, which has led to a prolonged period of lower cannabis wholesale prices and reduced indoor and outdoor cannabis cultivation. The oversupply has been driven by increased licensing activity across the U.S. and significant capital investment in the cannabis production marketplace over the past several years, as well as inconsistent enforcement of regulations. 
 In addition, we sell products that end users may purchase for use in industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis, that are subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions. For example, certain countries and 38 U.S. states have adopted frameworks that authorize, regulate, and tax the cultivation, processing, sale, and use of cannabis for medicinal and/or non-medicinal use, while the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the laws of other U.S. states prohibit growing cannabis. 
 If we are unable to effectively execute our e-commerce business, our reputation and operating results may be harmed. 
 We sell certain of our products over the Internet through our online store and our retail customer s e-commerce retail platforms. As consumers demonstrate greater reliance on e-commerce channels, the success of our business depends on our investment in e-commerce platforms, consumer preferences and buying trends relating to e-commerce, and our ability to both maintain the continuous operation of our online store and our fulfillment operations that support both our own and our retail customers e-commerce platforms. It is essential that these platforms provide a shopping experience that will generate orders and return visits to the respective platforms. 
 We are also vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with our e-commerce business, including: changes in required technology interfaces; website downtime and other technical failures; costs and technical issues associated with website software, systems and technology investments and upgrades; data and system security; system failures, disruptions and breaches and the costs to address and remedy such failures, disruptions or breaches; computer viruses; and changes in and compliance with applicable federal and state regulations. In addition, our efforts to remain competitive with technology trends, including the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other e-commerce marketing tools such as paid search and mobile applications, among others, may increase our costs and may not increase sales or attract consumers. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales of our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. 
 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 Additionally, the success of our e-commerce business and the satisfaction of our consumers depend on the timely receipt of our products by our consumers. The efficient delivery of our products to our consumers requires that our distribution centers have adequate capacity to support the current level of e-commerce operations and any anticipated increased levels that may occur as a result of the growth of our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with our distribution centers, or if any distribution centers shut down for any reason, including as a result of pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, government shut downs, work stoppages and fire or other natural disasters, we could face inventory shortages that may result in out of stock conditions in our online store, incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our consumers and experience dissatisfaction from our consumers. Any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and harm our reputation. 
 Our operations, financial condition or reputation may be impaired if our information or operational technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber-attack. 
 We rely on information and operational technology systems to conduct business, including communicating with associates and our key retail customers, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, shipping products to retail customers and analyzing and reporting results of operations. While we have taken steps to ensure the security of our information and operational technology systems, including those of our customers, vendors, suppliers and other third-party service providers on whom we rely, our systems, as well the systems utilized by our customers, vendors, suppliers and other third-party service providers, have, in the past, been and may, in the future, be vulnerable to cyber threats such as malware, security breaches, phishing attacks, unauthorized activity, system failures, defects, unintentional or malicious actions of associates, contractors, and bad actors (e.g., cyber criminal groups, nation state actors and hacktivist organizations). 
 We have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the number of such cyber threats. In addition, while we maintain cyber-security insurance, costs related to a cyber-attack may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of our cyber-security insurance policy. As cyber-attacks increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain cyber-security insurance in amounts and on terms we view as appropriate for our operations. 
 If our information or operational technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly for an extended period of time, whether as a result of a significant cyber-incident or any other adverse event, our ability to operate or communicate internally as well as with our retail customers, vendors, suppliers and other parties critical to our business, could be significantly impaired, which may adversely impact our business. 
 Additionally, in the normal course of our business, we collect, store and transmit proprietary and confidential information regarding our customers, consumers, associates, suppliers and others, including personally identifiable information. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy and security laws and regulations, that apply to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer and employee data, including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries. High-profile security breaches of the information systems of a number of U.S. companies and/or government agencies may result in increased regulations and new security laws. 
 An operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber-threats could lead to loss, misuse or unauthorized disclosure of this information about our associates or consumers, which may result in regulatory or other legal proceedings, and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly-evolving types of cyber-attacks. Any such attacks or precautionary measures taken to prevent anticipated attacks may result in increasing costs, including costs for additional technologies, training and third-party consultants. The losses incurred from a cybersecurity-related event as well as the precautionary measures required to address this evolving risk may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation. 
 Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to avoid or effectively mitigate the material impact on our financial position or results of operations resulting from claims or liabilities against us, and we may not be able to obtain appropriate insurance coverage in the future. 
 We maintain insurance coverage to manage our exposure to future claims and liabilities that may adversely impact our financial position or results of operations. The extent of our insurance program is under continuous review and coverages are modified as we deem necessary to mitigate current or emerging risks. Despite our program, it is possible that claims or liabilities against us may have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage, when our existing insurance policies expire. 
 We maintain an insurance program that includes coverage to de-risk against claims associated with property damage, management liability, cargo liability, cyber threats, workers compensation and general liability losses. While we expect to be able to continue our insurance coverages, there can be no assurance that we will be able to procure insurance coverage, or that such policy limits will be adequate to cover any liability we may incur, or that our insurance premiums will continue to be available at a cost similar to our cost today. The volatility of the insurance and reinsurance markets are also subject to macroeconomic conditions and events that are outside of our control.

Table of Contents 

 Additionally, it is possible one or more of our insurers could specifically exclude from our policy certain chemicals used in our products. Consequently, we may have to cease use of those chemicals and/or be forced to substitute less effective or more expensive alternatives to continue manufacturing and/or distributing such goods. A substantial increase in liability exposure or the loss of customers or product offerings could each have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our international operations make us susceptible to the costs and risks associated with operating internationally. 
 We operate manufacturing, sales and service facilities outside of the United States, particularly in Canada, the Netherlands, Mexico and China. Accordingly, we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including: 
 fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 
 limitations on the remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; 
 additional costs of compliance with local regulations; 
 historically, in certain countries, higher rates of inflation than in the United States; 
 changes in the economic conditions or consumer preferences or demand for our products in these markets; 
 restrictive actions by multinational governing bodies, foreign governments or subdivisions thereof; 
 changes in foreign labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain associates; 
 changes in U.S. and foreign laws regarding trade and investment, including the impact of tariffs; 
 less robust protection of our intellectual property under foreign laws; and 
 difficulty in obtaining distribution and support for our products, including the impact of shipping port delays. 
 In addition, our operations outside the United States are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. The costs associated with operating our continuing international business could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the future. 
 In the event the Third Restated Agreement for Monsanto s consumer Roundup products terminates or Monsanto s consumer Roundup business materially declines, we would lose a substantial source of future earnings and overhead expense absorption. 
 If we (i) become insolvent, (ii) commit a material breach, material fraud or material willful misconduct under the Third Restated Agreement, (iii) experience a change of control (subject to certain exceptions), or (iv) impermissibly assign our rights or delegate our obligations under the Third Restated Agreement, Monsanto may terminate the Third Restated Agreement without paying a termination fee to the Company, subject to certain terms and conditions as set forth therein. In addition, if Program EBIT (as defined in the Third Restated Agreement) falls below 50.0 million in any program year, Monsanto may terminate the Third Restated Agreement without paying a termination fee to the Company, subject to certain terms and conditions as set forth therein. 
 Monsanto may also terminate the Third Restated Agreement in the event of (a) a change of control of Monsanto or a sale of the Roundup business effective at the end of the fifth full year after providing notice of termination, subject to certain terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable agreements, or (b) Monsanto s decision to decommission the permits, licenses and registrations needed for, and the trademarks, trade names, packages, copyrights and designs used in, the sale of the Roundup products in the lawn and garden market (a Brand Decommissioning Event ), but, in each case, Monsanto would have to pay a termination fee to the Company. 
 If circumstances exist or otherwise develop that result in a material decline in Monsanto s consumer Roundup business, or in the event of Monsanto s insolvency or bankruptcy, we would seek to mitigate the impact on us by exercising various rights and remedies under the Third Restated Agreement and applicable law. We cannot, however, provide any assurance that our exercise of such rights or remedies would produce the desired outcomes or that a material decline in Monsanto s consumer Roundup business would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 In the event that the Third Restated Agreement terminates or Monsanto s consumer Roundup business materially declines, we would lose all, or a substantial portion, of the significant source of earnings and overhead expense absorption the Third Restated Agreement provides. 
 For additional information regarding the Third Restated Agreement including certain of our rights and remedies under the Third Restated Agreement, see NOTE 6. MARKETING AGREEMENT of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.

 We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business. 
 Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks, trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license, particularly our registered brand names and issued patents. Although we have a robust portfolio of registered trademarks, we have not sought to register each of our marks either in the United States or in every country in which such mark is used. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the United States with respect to the registered brand names and issued patents we hold. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, proprietary information and/or brand names, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. A successful claim of trademark, patent or other intellectual property infringement against us, or any other successful challenge to the use of our intellectual property, could subject us to damages or prevent us from providing certain products or services, or using certain of our recognized brand names, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our success depends upon the retention and availability of key personnel and the effective succession of senior management. 
 Our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key personnel. Our future operations could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior executives and other key personnel. In fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, we experienced management transitions involving our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer and General Counsel. In addition, our current Chief Financial Officer will be departing the Company effective December 31, 2024. For additional information regarding this departure, see ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION of this Form 10-K. 
 If we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our chief executive officer, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. 
 Our workforce reductions may cause undesirable consequences and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 During fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we undertook strategic reductions in our workforce as part of an on-going series of organizational changes and initiatives intended to create operational and management-level efficiencies. This workforce reduction may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction in workforce and reduced employee morale, which may cause our associates who were not affected by the reduction in workforce to seek alternate employment. Associates whose positions were eliminated or those who determine to seek alternate employment may seek employment with our competitors. 
 We cannot provide assurance that we will not undertake additional workforce reductions or that we will be able to realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our previous or any future workforce reduction plans. In addition, if we continue to reduce our workforce, it may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to any new product, growth or revenue opportunities and to execute our business plans. Additionally, reductions in workforce may make it more difficult to recruit and retain associates if they perceive uncertainty in employment. If we need to increase the size of our workforce in the future, we may encounter a competitive hiring market due to labor shortages, increased employee turnover, changes in the availability of workers and increased wage costs. 
 We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and, while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We are involved in legal proceedings and are subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities, arising in the course of our business (see the discussion in ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS of this Form 10-K). Legal proceedings, in general, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts of damages, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, product liability claims challenging the safety of our products or products we market on behalf of third parties may also result in a decline in sales for a particular product and could damage the reputation or the value of related brands, involve us in litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business.

Table of Contents 

 From time to time, we are also involved in legal proceedings involving contract, intellectual property and other matters including, for example, the securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits discussed in ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS of this Form 10-K. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations and, depending on the nature of the allegations, could negatively impact our reputation or the reputation of products we market on behalf of third parties. Additionally, defending against these legal proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management s attention and resources. 
 Risks Related to Our M A, Lending and Financing Activities 
 Our indebtedness could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2,242.8 million of debt and 1,167.0 million in available borrowings under our credit facility. Our inability to meet restrictive financial and non-financial covenants associated with that debt, or to generate sufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt, could adversely affect our financial condition. For example, our debt level could: 
 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness; 
 make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the cash flows available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, advertising, research and development efforts, pay dividends, repurchase our Common Shares and other general corporate activities; 
 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; 
 limit our ability to borrow additional funds; 
 expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates; and 
 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt. 
 Our ability to make payments on or to refinance our indebtedness, fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and repurchase our Common Shares will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot provide any assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. 
 Our credit facility and the indentures governing our 5.250 Senior Notes due 2026 (the 5.250 Senior Notes ), our 4.500 Senior Notes due 2029 (the 4.500 Senior Notes ), our 4.000 Senior Notes due 2031 (the 4.000 Senior Notes and our 4.375 Senior Notes due 2032 (the 4.375 Senior Notes and, collectively with the 5.250 Senior Notes, the 4.500 Senior Notes and the 4.000 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes contain restrictive covenants and cross-default provisions. For example, under our credit facility the maximum permitted leverage ratio is (i) 6.00 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, (ii) 5.50 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, (iii) 5.25 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, (iv) 5.00 for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, (v) 4.75 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and (vi) 4.50 for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and thereafter. Our leverage ratio was 4.86 at September 30, 2024. In addition, our credit facility contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant which sets the minimum permitted fixed charge coverage ratio at 1.00. Our fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.27 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. The Senior Notes contain an interest coverage ratio covenant which sets the minimum permitted interest coverage ratio at 2.00. Our interest coverage ratio was 3.57 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. A breach of any of these financial ratio covenants or other covenants could result in a default and/or a cross default under the credit facility and Senior Notes, as applicable. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and could cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. We cannot provide any assurance that the holders of such indebtedness would waive a default or that we would have the resources to pay the accelerated indebtedness in full. 
 Subject to compliance with certain covenants under our credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes, we may incur additional debt in the future. If we incur additional debt, the risks described above could intensify.

 Significant or prolonged periods of higher interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Interest rates have a direct impact on our business due to the amount of variable rate debt the Company utilizes in its operations. Prolonged periods of higher interest rates may have a negative impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. All of our debt under the sixth amended and restated credit agreement (the Sixth A R Credit Agreement bears interest at variable rates primarily derived from, as defined therein, the (i) the Alternate Base Rate, (ii) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or (iii) the Swingline Rate. In a rising interest rate environment, debt financing will become more expensive and may have higher transactional and servicing costs. For example, the weighted average interest rates on average borrowings under the Sixth A R Credit Agreement, excluding the impact of interest rate swaps, were 9.1 , 7.6 and 2.8 for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. 
 Although the Company has taken steps to reduce our exposure to variable rate debt instruments, if interest rates remain relatively high or increase in the future, we could see increases in our borrowing costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Global economic and capital market conditions may limit our access to capital and/or increase the costs of such capital. 
 In the future, we may need new or additional financing to provide liquidity to conduct our operations, expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness. Any sustained weakness in general economic conditions and/or U.S. or global capital markets could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all. From time to time we have relied, and we may also rely in the future, on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Our access to funds under our credit facility depends on the ability of the lenders that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments. Moreover, the obligations of the lenders under our credit facility are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one lender does not need to be made up by the others. Longer term volatility in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation of financial institutions or reduced alternatives could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term. Such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. 
 Acquisitions, other strategic alliances and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Acquisitions, strategic alliances and investments are an important element of our long-term corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or product has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include: 
 Assumptions implicit to our acquisition strategy or valuations are not realized. 
 Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges. 
 Failure to successfully further develop the acquired business or product lines. 
 Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company. 
 Integration of the acquired company s accounting, human resources and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions. 
 Transition of operations, users and customers onto our existing platforms. 
 Reliance on the expertise of our strategic partners with respect to market development, sales, local regulatory compliance and other operational matters. 
 Failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval, under competition and antitrust laws which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition. 
 In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. 
 Cultural challenges associated with integrating associates from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of associates from the businesses we acquire.

 Strategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake and that we do not control may from time to time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals. As a result, business decisions or other actions or omissions of controlling owners, management, or other persons or entities who control companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, or otherwise damage our reputation. 
 Liability for or reputational harm from activities of the acquired company before the acquisition or from our strategic partners, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities. 
 Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated associates, customers, former shareholders or other third parties. 
 Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments or strategic alliances could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, investments or alliances, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. 
 Our acquisitions, strategic alliances and investments could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows. Also, the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. 
 Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs) could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our Senior Notes. 
 NRSROs rate the Senior Notes and the Company based on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the NRSROs can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of the Senior Notes or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could increase our cost of financing, limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of the Senior Notes. 
 In August 2023, S P Global Ratings lowered our issuer credit rating to B+ from BB- and lowered its rating on our Senior Notes to B- from B. Also in August 2023, Moody s Investors Service lowered (i) our Corporate Family Rating to B1 from Ba3, (ii) our Probability of Default Rating to B1-PD from Ba3-PD and (iii) its rating on the Senior Notes to B2 from B1. 
 A failure to dispose of assets or businesses in a timely manner may cause the results of the Company to suffer. 
 We evaluate as necessary the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help meet our objectives. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. Alternatively, we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had anticipated. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the pre-closing conditions must also be satisfied or waived, which may prevent us from completing the transaction. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside our control could affect our future financial results. 
 Our lending activities may adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 As part of our strategic initiatives, we have provided financing to certain strategic partners. Our exposure to credit losses on these financing balances and strategic investments will depend on the financial condition of these counterparties as well as legal, regulatory and macroeconomic factors beyond our control, such as deteriorating conditions in the world economy or in the industries served by the borrowers and federal legalization of the U.S. cannabis market. While we monitor our exposure, there can be no guarantee we will be able to successfully mitigate all of these risks. For example, during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, the Company recorded non-cash, pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its convertible debt investments of 64.6 million and 101.3 million, respectively. These or other credit losses, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Our hedging arrangements expose us to certain counterparty risks. 
 In addition to commodity hedge agreements, we utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage the net interest rate risk inherent in our sources of borrowing as well as foreign currency forward contracts to manage the exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and other approved transactional currency exposures. Utilizing these hedge agreements exposes us to certain counterparty risks. The failure of one or more of the counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the hedge agreements, whether as a result of weakening financial stability or otherwise, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Our postretirement-related costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets, changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions. 
 We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans associated with our U.S. and former international businesses, as well as a postretirement medical plan in the United States for certain retired associates and their dependents. The performance of the financial markets and changes in interest rates impact the funded status of these plans and may cause volatility in our postretirement-related costs and future funding requirements. If the financial markets do not provide the expected long-term returns on invested assets, we could be required to make significant pension contributions. Additionally, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. 
 We utilize third-party actuaries to evaluate assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. In the event we determine that our assumptions should be revised, such as the discount rate or expected return on assets, our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. The assumptions we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements. 
 Risks Related to Regulation of Our Company 
 Compliance with environmental and other public health regulations or changes in such regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to market all of our products. 
 Laws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect us in several ways. All pesticide products sold in the United States must comply with FIFRA and most must be registered with the U.S. EPA and similar state agencies. Our inability to obtain or maintain such registrations, or the cancellation of any such registration of our products, could have an adverse effect on our business, the severity of which would depend on a variety of factors, including the product(s) involved, whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected. We attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of, and access to, substitute active ingredients, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid these risks. For example, there are indications that federal agencies in the U.S. may take more restrictive positions on pesticides. In addition, several provinces in Canada have adopted regulations that substantially restrict our ability to market and sell certain consumer pesticide products. 
 Under the Food Quality Protection Act, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996, food-use pesticides are evaluated to determine whether there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the cumulative effects of pesticide exposures. Under this Act, the U.S. EPA is evaluating the cumulative and aggregate risks from dietary and non-dietary exposures to pesticides. The pesticides in our products, certain of which may be also used on crops processed into various food products, are manufactured by independent third parties and continue to be evaluated by the U.S. EPA as part of this exposure risk assessment. The U.S. EPA or the third-party registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us. We cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of these continuing evaluations. 
 In addition, the use of certain fertilizer and pesticide products (including pesticide products that contain glyphosate) is regulated by various environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may, among other things, limit or ban the use of certain ingredients contained in such products or require (i) that only certified or professional users apply the product, (ii) that certain products be used only on certain types of locations, (iii) users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, and/or (iv) notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future. Even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations and licenses, we cannot provide assurance that our products, particularly pesticide products, will not cause or be alleged to cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances, particularly when used improperly or contrary to instructions. The costs of compliance, remediation or products liability have adversely affected operating results in the past and could materially adversely affect future quarterly or annual operating results.

Table of Contents 

 Our products and operations may be subject to increased regulatory and environmental scrutiny in jurisdictions in which we do business. For example, we are subject to regulations relating to our harvesting of peat for our growing media business which has come under increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny. In the United States, state regulations frequently require us to limit our harvesting and to restore the property to an agreed-upon condition. In some locations, we have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water. In Canada, our peat extraction efforts are also the subject of regulation. 
 In addition to the laws and regulations already described, various governmental agencies regulate the disposal, transport, handling and storage of waste, the remediation of contaminated sites, air and water discharges from our facilities, and workplace health and safety. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we may be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation of the presence of certain regulated materials or damage to natural resources, at various properties, including current and former properties we have owned or operated, as well as offsite waste handling or disposal sites that we have used. Liability may be imposed upon us without regard to whether we knew of or caused the presence of such materials and, under certain circumstances, on a joint and several basis. There can be no assurances that the presence of such regulated materials at any such locations, or locations that we may acquire in the future, will not result in liability to us under such laws or regulations or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits based on alleged conduct or environmental conditions. 
 In 2021, the Biden Administration announced a multi-agency plan to address PFAS contamination. Various federal agencies, including the U.S. EPA, have and are expected to continue to take actions to prevent the release of PFAS into the air, drinking systems, and food supply and to expand cleanup efforts to remediate the impacts of PFAS pollution. As part of this announcement, the U.S. EPA released its PFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA s Commitments to Action 2021-2024, which identifies timelines by which the U.S. EPA plans to take specific actions during the Biden Administration. For example, in August 2022, the U.S. EPA proposed to designate PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, as hazardous substances under CERCLA, which could have wide-ranging impact on companies across various industries. Until further detail is provided, including whether the rule is enacted as proposed, we cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the impact of these proposed actions. Further, many states have taken action to address PFAS concerns with actions ranging from appropriation legislation to fund scientific research, bans on certain categories of consumer products containing PFAS and/or broad prohibitions on PFAS across all products. Complicating this patchwork of state regulation is that jurisdictions may differ as to what they consider PFAS. It is possible, therefore, that some of these actions will have an impact direct or indirect on our business. 
 Many states are increasingly scrutinizing packaging, including seeking to reduce single use plastics and establish extended producer responsibility programs, which are designed to bolster the recycling industry by transferring the cost of packaging disposal to the manufacturers. Extended producer responsibility programs typically include targets and reporting responsibilities for, among other things, post-consumer recycling usage, compostable packaging, material reduction and refill strategies. 
 The adequacy of our current non-FIFRA compliance-related environmental accruals and future provisions depends upon our operating in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations, as well as the assumptions that we have both identified the significant sites that must be remediated and that there are no significant conditions of potential contamination that are unknown to us. A significant change in the facts and circumstances underlying these assumptions or in current enforcement policies or requirements, or a finding that we are not in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on future environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flows. 
 We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States federal jurisdiction and various local, state and foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses and tax credits) and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly related to our operations in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income of the appropriate character in the relevant jurisdiction. 
 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 From time to time, tax proposals are introduced or considered by the U.S. Congress or the legislative bodies in local, state and foreign jurisdictions that could also affect our tax rate, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, or our tax liabilities. Our tax liabilities are also affected by the amounts we charge for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items in intercompany transactions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. In connection with these audits (or future audits), tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. As a result, the ultimate resolution of our tax audits, changes in tax laws or tax rates, and the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets could materially affect our tax provision, net income and cash flows in future periods. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Shares 
 The Company s decision to maintain, reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders or repurchasing our Common Shares could cause the market price for our Common Shares to decline. 
 Our payment of quarterly cash dividends on and repurchase of our Common Shares pursuant to a stock repurchase program are subject to, among other things, our financial position and results of operations, available cash and cash flow, capital requirements, credit facility provisions and other factors. Prior to fiscal 2022, we generally increased the cash dividends on our Common Shares as well as engaged in share repurchase activity. Since fiscal 2022, we have not changed the dividend amount nor have we engaged in share repurchase activity outside of our compensation programs. As of September 30, 2024, we do not have a board authorized share repurchase program. 
 We may maintain, or increase or decrease (including eliminating) the amount of cash dividends on, and increase or decrease the amount of repurchases of, our Common Shares in the future. Any decision by us regarding the payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our Common Shares could cause the market price of our Common Shares to decline. A failure to pay dividends, an inability to resume increases of our cash dividends or an inability to begin repurchasing Common Shares at historical levels could result in a lower market valuation of our Common Shares. 
 Hagedorn Partnership, L.P. beneficially owns approximately 24 of our Common Shares and can significantly influence decisions that require the approval of shareholders. 
 Hagedorn Partnership, L.P. beneficially owned approximately 24 of our outstanding Common Shares as of November 18, 2024. As a result, it has sufficient voting power to significantly influence the election of directors and the approval of other actions requiring the approval of our shareholders, including entering into certain business combination transactions. In addition, because of the percentage of ownership and voting concentration in Hagedorn Partnership, L.P., elections of our Board of Directors will generally be within the control of Hagedorn Partnership, L.P. While all of our shareholders are entitled to vote on matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, the concentration of our Common Shares and voting control presently lies with Hagedorn Partnership, L.P. As such, it would be difficult for shareholders to propose and have approved proposals not supported by Hagedorn Partnership, L.P. Hagedorn Partnership, L.P. s interests could differ from, or conflict with, the interests of other shareholders.

 ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 Cybersecurity risk was identified as a significant enterprise risk based on the results of our most recent enterprise risk assessment. As a significant enterprise risk, management has worked to identify the underlying drivers of cybersecurity risk, identify the activities in place to manage it, and assess its residual risk level. We have developed and implemented comprehensive strategies and processes to assess, identify, manage and mitigate cybersecurity risks, aligning with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework NIST-CSF ). These processes include: 
 implementing security event monitoring, incident response processes, access management controls, vulnerability identification and remediation, third-party risk monitoring, and user awareness and training; 
 providing regular security training and awareness content for all associates, with mandatory training for new hires; 
 maintaining cybersecurity risk insurance to mitigate potential breach-related costs; 
 engaging consultants to perform periodic external assessments using industry-recognized frameworks like NIST-CSF; and 
 monitoring program maturity through periodic reviews against the Capability Maturity Model Integration framework. 
 Mitigating Risks Posed by Third Parties 
 Risk Assessments 
 We identify and categorize existing third-party service providers based on criticality to our operations and prioritize those that pose the highest risks. We leverage a third-party risk management solution to facilitate our risk assessment process for new third parties which includes interviews and questionnaires with internal business contacts and contacts from the third party to perform an inherent risk assessment. We determine applicable security controls based on the inherent risk level to drive the residual risk score to an acceptable level where possible. The goal of the assessment process is to evaluate the risks associated with each third party, including operational, financial, legal, and reputational risks. 
 Ongoing Monitoring 
 Based on the residual risk score of a third party, we conduct assessments on a periodic basis to help ensure that we maintain current, up-to-date information on our vendors. We leverage an external third-party monitoring service to conduct continuous monitoring of our critical vendors to provide additional visibility and response efforts and work directly with vendors to remediate identified vulnerabilities. Finally, we review contracts that outline risk management responsibilities, compliance requirements, data protection, and incident management protocols. 
 Incident Management 
 We have developed an incident response plan that includes a process for addressing issues arising from third-party relationships which includes communication channels for reporting and managing incidents involving third parties. 
 Documentation and Reporting 
 We maintain detailed records of our third-party assessments and any evidence or documentation that is provided during the assessment process. We regularly review and report on third-party risk management activities and any significant issues to senior management and/or our Audit Committee or Board of Directors. 
 External Resources; Associate Training and Awareness 
 We have developed a comprehensive information security protocol that relies on support from third-party experts and an internal training and awareness program aligned with industry standards and best practices. 
 Given the complex and evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, we engage third-party advisors and consultants to assist us in developing and maintaining effective cybersecurity risk management processes. Partnering with these third parties allows us to leverage specialized knowledge and insights, better ensuring our cybersecurity strategies and processes are well-designed and effective. For example, we work with third parties to regularly conduct simulated attack exercises to identify additional needs for training and overall program refinement. 
 Internally, our training and awareness program creates multi-layered defenses by empowering associates with knowledge and tools to recognize and respond to security risks. Through role-specific and comprehensive training, we seek to maintain a workforce that actively contributes to our cybersecurity goals. Key components of our training program include:

Table of Contents 

 Onboarding Training All new associates participate in an initial cybersecurity training module at onboarding. This training covers the Company s security policies, data protection standards and foundational security practices helping to ensure that new hires are equipped to meet the Company s expectations pertaining to its security protocols. 
 Articles We publish articles on our intranet site for all associates to easily access. These articles highlight emerging threats, industry trends, and actionable tips to help associates enhance their personal and professional security posture. We target critical topics such as ransomware, social engineering, data management, and the latest threats and best practices. 
 Phishing Simulations Our phishing awareness program includes continuous phishing simulations conducted on a routine basis. This program helps associates develop the skills to effectively identify and mitigate phishing attempts. Associates who fail a threshold number of simulations during a calendar year are required to undergo additional training. 
 Cybersecurity Awareness Month Activities We have implemented interactive, virtual and on-site awareness activities during Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October. These activities include phishing simulations, articles, lunch and learns, and gamification to serve as refreshers on critical security concepts and reinforce our commitment to maintaining a security-conscious culture. 
 Governance 
 Our Board of Directors has overall oversight responsibility for our risk management and has delegated oversight of cybersecurity risks to our Audit Committee, including overseeing the actions management has taken to identify, monitor, and control such exposure. Our Audit Committee reviews the measures implemented by the Company to identify and mitigate data protection and cybersecurity risks on a quarterly basis. As part of our continued investment in developing our overall enterprise risk management program, our Audit Committee receives reports and presentations from management which address a range of topics including recent developments, evolving standards, vulnerability assessments, third-party and independent reviews, the threat environment, and technological trends. Our Audit Committee reports to our Board of Directors at least annually on cybersecurity matters. 
 At the management level, our Chief Information Security Officer CISO leads the team responsible for implementing, monitoring, and maintaining information security, including data protection practices across our business. Our CISO receives reports on cybersecurity threats from both our internal personnel and external partners on a regular basis. Our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Administrative Officer receive regular reports from our CISO on the cyber program and measures implemented by the Company to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Our CISO works closely with our Company s legal team to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory cybersecurity requirements. Our CISO has over a decade of cybersecurity and risk management experience and holds CISA, CISM, and CISSP certifications as well as a bachelor s degree in Business Information Systems. 
 Cybersecurity Threats and Incidents 
 To date, risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previous cybersecurity incidents, have not materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. During fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Company did not experience any cybersecurity threats or incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company or its business strategy, results of operations and/or financial condition. Despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats or incidents or provide assurances that we have not experienced undetected cybersecurity incidents. For additional details regarding the risks the Company faces from cybersecurity threats, see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Our operations, financial condition or reputation may be impaired if our information or operational technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber-attack in this Form 10-K.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 As noted in the discussion in ITEM 1. BUSINESS Regulatory Considerations Regulatory Matters of this Form 10-K, we are involved in several pending environmental and regulatory matters. We believe that our assessment of contingencies is reasonable and that the related accruals, in the aggregate, are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 On June 6, 2024, a purported shareholder filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-03132) on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of Common Shares between November 3, 2021, and August 1, 2023. On July 26, 2024, another purported shareholder filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-03766) on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of Common Shares between June 2, 2021, and August 1, 2023. These lawsuits, which will likely be consolidated with any subsequently filed lawsuits alleging similar facts, assert claims under Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5 and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act against the Company and certain of its current and former officers based on alleged misstatements about the Company s inventories, sales and business prospects. The actions seek, among other things, unspecified monetary damages, reasonable costs and expenses and equitable/injunctive or other relief as deemed appropriate by the Court. The Company believes that the claims asserted are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions. 
 On July 3, 2024, a purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-03636), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On July 30, 2024, a second purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No.1:24-cv-00402), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On August 23, 2024, a third purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-03880), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On September 9, 2024, a fourth purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Union County (Ohio) Court of Common Pleas (Case No. 24CV0193), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On September 26, 2024, a fifth purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Union County (Ohio) Court of Common Pleas (Case No. 24CV0203), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On November 19, 2024, a sixth purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-04180), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On November 22, 2024, a seventh purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-04190), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. The federal lawsuits will likely be consolidated with one another, along with any subsequently filed federal lawsuits alleging similar facts, and the state court lawsuits will likely be consolidated with one another, along with any subsequently filed state lawsuits alleging similar facts. All of the lawsuits include allegations that generally mirror those asserted in the securities lawsuits described above and assert claims for breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment, as well as abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. The federal lawsuits also assert claims under Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5, Section 14(a), Rule 14a-9, and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, and contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act. The actions seek a judgment in favor of the Company for damages in an unspecified amount, disgorgement, interest, and costs and expenses, including attorneys and experts fees. 
 The Company has been named as a defendant in a number of cases alleging injuries that the lawsuits claim resulted from exposure to asbestos-containing products, apparently based on the Company s historic use of vermiculite in certain of its products. In many of these cases, the complaints are not specific about the plaintiffs contacts with the Company or its products. The cases vary, but complaints in these cases generally seek unspecified monetary damages (actual, compensatory, consequential and punitive) from multiple defendants. The Company believes that the claims against it are without merit and is vigorously defending against them. The Company has not recorded any accruals in its consolidated financial statements as the likelihood of a loss from these cases is not probable at this time. The Company does not believe a reasonably possible loss would be material to the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these cases will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. There can be no assurance that future developments related to pending claims or claims filed in the future, whether as a result of adverse outcomes or as a result of significant defense costs, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 We are involved in other lawsuits and claims which arise in the normal course of our business including the initiation and defense of proceedings to protect intellectual property rights, advertising claims, securities matters and employment disputes. In our opinion, these claims individually and in the aggregate are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The purpose of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is to provide an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year-to-year. This MD A includes the following sections: 
 Executive summary 
 Results of operations 
 Segment results 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 Regulatory matters 
 Critical accounting estimates 
 Executive Summary 
 Our operations are divided into three reportable segments: U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne and Other. U.S. Consumer consists of our consumer lawn and garden business in the United States. Hawthorne consists of our indoor and hydroponic gardening business. Other primarily consists of our consumer lawn and garden business in Canada. This division of reportable segments is consistent with how the segments report to and are managed by our chief operating decision maker. In addition, Corporate consists of general and administrative expenses and certain other income and expense items not allocated to the business segments. See SEGMENT RESULTS below for additional information regarding our evaluation of segment performance. 
 Through our U.S. Consumer and Other segments, we are the leading manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden products in North America. Our products are marketed under some of the most recognized brand names in the industry. Our key consumer lawn and garden brands include Scotts Turf Builder lawn fertilizer and Scotts grass seed products; Miracle-Gro soil, plant food and gardening products; Ortho herbicide and pesticide products; and Tomcat rodent control and animal repellent products. We are the exclusive agent of Monsanto for the marketing and distribution of certain of Monsanto s consumer Roundup branded products within the United States and certain other specified countries. In addition, we have an equity interest in Bonnie Plants, LLC, a joint venture with AFC, focused on planting, growing, developing, distributing, marketing and selling live plants. 
 Through our Hawthorne segment, we are a leading provider of nutrients, lighting and other materials used for indoor and hydroponic gardening in North America. Our key brands include General Hydroponics , Gavita , Botanicare , Agrolux , Gro Pro , Mother Earth , Grower s Edge , HydroLogic Purification System and CYCO . 
 As a leading consumer branded lawn and garden company, our product development and marketing efforts are largely focused on providing innovative and differentiated products and continually increasing brand and product awareness to inspire consumers to create retail demand. We have implemented this model for a number of years by focusing on research and development and investing approximately 3-5 of our U.S. Consumer segment annual net sales in advertising to support and promote our consumer lawn and garden products and brands. We continually explore new and innovative ways to communicate with consumers. We believe that we receive a significant benefit from these expenditures and anticipate a similar commitment to research and development, advertising and marketing investments in the future, with the continuing objective of driving category growth and profitably maintaining and/or increasing market share. 
 Our consumer lawn and garden net sales in any one year are susceptible to weather conditions in the markets in which our products are sold. For instance, periods of abnormally wet or dry weather can adversely impact the sale of certain products, while increasing demand for other products. We believe that our diversified product line and our geographic diversification reduce this risk, although to a lesser extent in a year in which unfavorable weather is geographically widespread and extends across a significant portion of the lawn and garden season. We also believe that weather conditions in any one year, positive or negative, do not materially impact longer-term category growth trends.

 THE SCOTTS MIRACLE-GRO COMPANY 
 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 

 Due to the seasonal nature of the consumer lawn and garden business, significant portions of our U.S. Consumer and Other segment net sales ship to our retail customers during our second and third fiscal quarters, as noted in the following table. Our annual net sales are further concentrated in the second and third fiscal quarters by retailers who rely on our ability to deliver products closer to when consumers buy our products. Our Hawthorne segment is also impacted by seasonal sales patterns for certain product categories due to the timing of growing patterns in North America during our second and third fiscal quarters, and the timing of certain controlled agricultural lighting project sales during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. 
 Percent of Net Sales from Continuing Operations by Quarter 2024 2023 2022 First Quarter 11.6 14.8 14.4 Second Quarter 42.9 43.2 42.8 Third Quarter 33.8 31.5 30.2 Fourth Quarter 11.7 10.5 12.6 
 Management focuses on a variety of key indicators and operating metrics to monitor the financial condition and performance of the continuing operations of our business. These metrics include consumer purchases (point-of-sale data), market share, category growth, net sales (including unit volume, mix, pricing and foreign exchange movements), gross margins, advertising to net sales ratios, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss), earnings per share, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and interest coverage ratio. We also focus on measures to optimize cash flow and return on invested capital, including the management of working capital and capital expenditures. 
 Recent Events 
 During fiscal 2022, we began implementing a series of Company-wide organizational changes and initiatives intended to create operational and management-level efficiencies. As part of this restructuring initiative, we reduced the size of our supply chain network, reduced staffing levels and implemented other cost-reduction initiatives. We also accelerated the reduction of certain Hawthorne inventory, primarily lighting, growing environments and hardware products, to reduce our on hand inventory to align with the reduced network capacity. These efforts have delivered run-rate annualized savings of more than 300.0, which has increased our gross margin rate and lowered SG A. During fiscal 2024, we incurred costs of 83.5 in the Cost of sales impairment, restructuring and other line and 6.0 in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations associated with this restructuring initiative primarily related to inventory write-down charges, employee termination benefits, facility closure costs and impairment of right-of-use assets, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and software. Costs incurred from the inception of this restructuring initiative through September 30, 2024 were 383.5. Future costs associated with this restructuring initiative are not expected to be material. 
 During fiscal 2024, our Hawthorne segment continued to experience adverse financial results primarily due to decreased sales volume. The decrease in sales volume is attributable to an oversupply of cannabis, which has led to a prolonged period of lower cannabis wholesale prices and reduced indoor and outdoor cannabis cultivation. The oversupply has been driven by increased licensing activity across the U.S. and significant capital investment in the cannabis production marketplace over the past several years, as well as inconsistent enforcement of regulations. We expect that the oversupply of cannabis will continue to adversely impact our Hawthorne segment. If the oversupply of cannabis persists longer, or is more significant than we expect, our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted for a longer period and to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. 
 During fiscal 2024, our Hawthorne segment announced a strategic partnership with BFG Supply BFG ), a leading national horticultural and agricultural product distributor, under which BFG will distribute Hawthorne s proprietary Signature brand cultivation supplies and solutions. Our Hawthorne segment also announced it is discontinuing the distribution of other companies products and shifting its focus solely to marketing, innovating and supporting its portfolio of Signature brands, including General Hydroponics , Gavita , Botanicare , Gro Pro , Mother Earth , Grower s Edge , HydroLogic Purification System and CYCO . We expect the discontinuation of sales of other companies products will decrease the sales volume of our Hawthorne segment in future periods, but will enable continued optimization of its operations and improvement of its profitability.

 THE SCOTTS MIRACLE-GRO COMPANY 
 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 

 During fiscal 2024, we continued to experience the impacts of cost inflation and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions (including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East), resulting in persistently high manufacturing costs, elevated interest rates and volatile commodity costs. Higher costs over the past several years required us to implement significant price increases across our business in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, and we implemented targeted price reductions on certain products during fiscal 2024. We expect inflationary headwinds, volatile commodity costs and elevated interest rates to continue. The impact that these trends will continue to have on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including inflationary, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, and their potential impact on consumer behavior, which are difficult to predict. 
 During fiscal 2024, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charge of 64.6 related to our convertible debt investments in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to NOTE 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for more information regarding convertible debt investments. In addition, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of 61.9 associated with our investment in Bonnie Plants, LLC in the Equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal 2024. Refer to NOTE 8. INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for more information regarding our investment in Bonnie Plants, LLC.

 Net sales for fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 were primarily driven by the offsetting changes below: 
 increased sales volume, comprised of the net impact of higher volume in our U.S. Consumer segment driven by mulch, soils and controls products, partially offset by lower volume in our Hawthorne segment driven by the discontinuation of sales of other companies products; and 
 increased net sales associated with the Roundup marketing agreement; 
 offset by decreased pricing in our U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne and Other segments. 
 The decrease in net sales for fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by: 
 decreased sales volume across all segments driven by growing environments, growing media, hardware, nutrients and lighting products in our Hawthorne segment; and lawn care, plant food and controls products in our U.S. Consumer segment; and 
 the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar; 
 partially offset by increased pricing in our U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne and Other segments.

 SG A increased 7.7, or 1.4 , during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. Advertising expense increased 17.3, or 14.0 , in fiscal 2024 driven by increased media spending in our U.S. Consumer segment. Share-based compensation expense, which excludes certain advertising expenses paid for in Common Shares, increased 7.5, or 15.1 , due to a cumulative adjustment recognized during fiscal 2023 for certain performance-based award units to reflect management s assessment of a lower probability of achievement of performance goals. Amortization expense decreased 8.7, or 38.5 , driven by the impairment of certain Hawthorne segment intangible assets during fiscal 2023. Other SG A decreased by 7.3, or 2.3 , driven by reductions in staffing levels and other cost-reduction initiatives. 
 SG A decreased 61.7, or 10.1 , during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Advertising expense increased 3.4, or 2.8 , in fiscal 2023 driven by increased media spending in our U.S. Consumer segment. Share-based compensation expense, which excludes certain advertising expenses paid for in Common Shares, increased 15.4, or 44.9 , driven by short-term variable incentive compensation that was provided to associates as share-based awards for fiscal 2023 in lieu of a cash-based program, partially offset by the recognition of a cumulative adjustment for certain performance-based award units to reflect management s assessment of a lower probability of achievement of performance goals. Amortization expense decreased 8.4, or 27.1 , driven by the impairment of certain Hawthorne segment intangible assets during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. Other SG A and research and development costs decreased by a combined 72.1, or 16.9 , driven by reductions in staffing levels and other cost-reduction initiatives.

 Impairment, Restructuring and Other 
 Activity described herein is classified within the Cost of sales impairment, restructuring and other and Impairment, restructuring and other lines in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table details impairment, restructuring and other charges (recoveries) for each of the periods presented: 
 Year Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2022 Cost of sales impairment, restructuring and other: Restructuring and other charges, net 72.9 148.5 143.6 Property, plant and equipment impairments 5.3 11.4 16.6 Right-of-use asset impairments 5.3 25.8 Operating expenses impairment, restructuring and other: Convertible debt other-than-temporary impairments 64.6 101.3 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments 2.5 127.9 668.3 Restructuring and other charges (recoveries), net (4.3) 51.2 40.9 Gains on sale of property, plant and equipment (16.2) Total impairment, restructuring and other charges 146.3 466.1 853.2 
 During fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we recorded non-cash, pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charges related to our convertible debt investments of 64.6 and 101.3, respectively, in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to NOTE 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for more information regarding convertible debt investments. 
 During fiscal 2024, we recorded a gain of 12.1 in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations associated with a payment received in resolution of a dispute with the former ownership group of a business that was acquired in fiscal 2022. 
 During fiscal 2022, we began implementing a series of Company-wide organizational changes and initiatives intended to create operational and management-level efficiencies. As part of this restructuring initiative, we reduced the size of our supply chain network, reduced staffing levels and implemented other cost-reduction initiatives. We also accelerated the reduction of certain Hawthorne inventory, primarily lighting, growing environments and hardware products, to reduce on hand inventory to align with the reduced network capacity. During fiscal 2024, we incurred costs of 89.4 associated with this restructuring initiative primarily related to inventory write-down charges, employee termination benefits, facility closure costs and impairment of right-of-use assets, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and software. We incurred costs of 11.3 in our U.S. Consumer segment and 71.8 in our Hawthorne segment in the Cost of sales impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal 2024. We incurred costs of 1.5 in our U.S. Consumer segment, 1.0 in our Hawthorne segment, 1.1 in our Other segment and 2.4 at Corporate in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal 2024. During fiscal 2023, we incurred costs of 229.0 associated with this restructuring initiative primarily related to inventory write-down charges, employee termination benefits, facility closure costs and impairment of right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment. We incurred costs of 16.3 in our U.S. Consumer segment and 168.5 in our Hawthorne segment in the Cost of sales impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal 2023. We incurred costs of 7.7 in our U.S. Consumer segment, 20.7 in our Hawthorne segment, 0.8 in our Other segment and 14.9 at Corporate in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2022, we incurred costs of 65.2 associated with this restructuring initiative primarily related to employee termination benefits and impairment of property, plant and equipment. We incurred costs of 9.7 in our U.S. Consumer segment and 27.1 in our Hawthorne segment in the Cost of sales impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal 2022. We incurred costs of 11.9 in our U.S. Consumer segment, 8.1 in our Hawthorne segment, 0.7 in our Other segment and 7.7 at Corporate in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal 2022. Costs incurred since the inception of this restructuring initiative through September 30, 2024 were 58.3 for our U.S. Consumer segment, 297.2 for our Hawthorne segment, 2.9 for our Other segment and 25.1 at Corporate. 
 During fiscal 2023, we recorded non-cash, pre-tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 127.9 in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, comprised of 117.7 of finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges associated with our Hawthorne segment and 10.3 of goodwill impairment charges associated with our Other segment.

 During fiscal 2022, we recorded non-cash, pre-tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 632.4 as a result of interim impairment testing of our Hawthorne segment in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, comprised of 522.4 of goodwill impairment charges and 110.0 of finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges. 
 During fiscal 2022, we incurred inventory write-down charges of 120.9 in the Cost of sales impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of 35.3 in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations associated with our decision to discontinue and exit the market for certain Hawthorne lighting products and brands. 
 During fiscal 2022, we recorded gains of 16.2 in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations associated with the sale of property, plant and equipment. 
 Other (Income) Expense, net 
 Other (income) expense is comprised of activities such as the discount on sales of accounts receivable under the Master Receivables Purchase Agreement, royalty income from the licensing of certain of our brand names and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses. Other (income) expense was 19.9, (0.1) and 0.8 in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. The increase in expense during fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the discount on sales of accounts receivable under the Master Receivables Purchase Agreement. 
 Income (Loss) from Operations 
 Income (loss) from operations was 208.8 in fiscal 2024 compared to (174.4) in fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily driven by lower impairment, restructuring and other charges and a higher gross margin rate, partially offset by higher other expense and higher SG A. 
 Loss from operations was (174.4) in fiscal 2023 compared to (434.0) in fiscal 2022. The decrease was driven by lower impairment, restructuring and other charges and lower SG A, partially offset by lower net sales and a decrease in gross margin rate. 
 Equity in Loss of Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 Equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates associated with Bonnie Plants, LLC was 68.1, 101.1 and 12.9 in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. We recorded pre-tax impairment charges associated with our investment in Bonnie Plants, LLC of 61.9 and 94.7 during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. Refer to NOTE 8. INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for more information regarding Bonnie Plants, LLC. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 158.8 in fiscal 2024, a decrease of 10.8 compared to 178.1 in fiscal 2023. The decrease was driven by lower average borrowings of 554.8, partially offset by an increase in our weighted average interest rate, net of the impact of interest rate swaps, of 40 basis points. The decrease in average borrowings was driven by our focus on using available cash flow to reduce our debt as well as the impact of the expiration of the Receivables Facility and the execution of the Master Receivables Purchase Agreement. The increase in our weighted average interest rate was primarily driven by higher borrowing rates under the Sixth A R Credit Agreement. 
 Interest expense was 178.1 in fiscal 2023, an increase of 50.8 compared to 118.1 in fiscal 2022. The increase was driven by an increase in our weighted average interest rate, net of the impact of interest rate swaps, of 180 basis points, primarily driven by higher borrowing rates under the Sixth A R Credit Agreement. While we had net debt repayments of 353.6 during fiscal 2023, our seasonal borrowing and repayment pattern resulted in an average debt balance for fiscal 2023 that was consistent with fiscal 2022.

 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 A reconciliation of the federal corporate income tax rate and the effective tax rate on loss before income taxes is summarized below: 
 Year Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2022 Statutory income tax rate 21.0 21.0 21.0 Effect of foreign operations (2.0) 0.2 (1.6) State taxes, net of federal benefit 8.0 3.2 2.6 Effect of other permanent differences (32.8) (0.8) 2.8 Research and Experimentation and other federal tax credits 2.9 0.2 0.2 Effect of tax contingencies 3.7 0.1 (1.8) Change in valuation allowances (57.4) (8.7) (0.9) Other 8.7 1.0 (0.7) Effective income tax rate (47.9) 16.2 21.6 
 For fiscal 2024, the impact on the effective tax rate of the items noted in the table above increased due to the decrease in loss before income taxes for fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses on convertible debt investments were 43.6 and 33.4 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A full valuation allowance was recorded against these losses at September 30, 2024 and 2023 as we do not expect to utilize them prior to their expiration, and this impact is included in the Change in valuation allowances line in the table above. 
 Net Loss 
 Net loss was 34.9, or 0.61 per diluted share, in fiscal 2024 compared to 380.1, or 6.79 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023. The decrease was driven by lower impairment, restructuring and other charges, a higher gross margin rate, lower equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher other expense, higher income tax expense and higher SG A. 
 Net loss was 380.1, or 6.79 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023 compared to 437.5, or 7.88 per diluted share, in fiscal 2022. The decrease was driven by lower impairment, restructuring and other charges, and lower SG A, partially offset by lower net sales, a decrease in gross margin rate, higher equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates, higher interest expense, lower other non-operating income and lower income tax benefit. 
 Diluted average common shares used in the diluted loss per common share calculation for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were 56.8 million, 56.0 million and 55.5 million, respectively, which excluded potential common shares of 0.9 million, 0.4 million and 0.6 million, respectively, because the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive as we incurred a net loss for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
 Segment Results 
 The performance of each reportable segment is evaluated based on several factors, including income (loss) before income taxes, amortization, impairment, restructuring and other charges Segment Profit (Loss) ), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Senior management uses Segment Profit (Loss) to evaluate segment performance because they believe this measure is indicative of performance trends and the overall earnings potential of each segment. 
 The following table sets forth net sales by segment: 
 Year Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2022 U.S. Consumer 3,013.7 2,843.7 2,928.8 Hawthorne 294.7 467.3 716.2 Other 244.3 240.3 279.1 Consolidated 3,552.7 3,551.3 3,924.1

 U.S. Consumer Segment Profit was 454.1 in fiscal 2023, a decrease of 20.1 from fiscal 2022 Segment Profit of 568.6. The decrease for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower net sales and a lower gross margin rate, partially offset by lower SG A. 
 Hawthorne 
 Hawthorne segment net sales were 294.7 in fiscal 2024, a decrease of 36.9 from fiscal 2023 net sales of 467.3. The decrease was driven by lower sales volume of 36.8 and decreased pricing of 0.5 , partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rates of 0.4 . The decrease in sales volume for fiscal 2024 was driven by all product categories and the impact of the discontinuation of sales of other companies products. 
 Hawthorne Segment Loss was 14.2 in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 Segment Loss of 48.1. The improvement was driven by a higher gross margin rate and lower SG A, partially offset by lower net sales. 
 Hawthorne segment net sales were 467.3 in fiscal 2023, a decrease of 34.8 from fiscal 2022 net sales of 716.2. The decrease was driven by lower sales volume of 38.1 , partially offset by increased pricing of 2.5 and acquisitions of 0.8 .

 Corporate 
 Corporate expenses were 117.7 in fiscal 2024, an increase of 15.8 from fiscal 2023 expenses of 101.6. The increase was primarily driven by higher share-based compensation expense due to the recognition of a cumulative adjustment in fiscal 2023 for certain performance-based award units to reflect management s assessment of a lower probability of achievement of performance goals, partially offset by reductions in staffing levels and other cost-reduction initiatives. 
 Corporate expenses were 101.6 in fiscal 2023, a decrease of 9.6 from fiscal 2022 expenses of 112.4.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following table summarizes cash activities for the years ended September 30: 
 2024 2023 2022 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 667.5 531.0 (129.0) Net cash used in investing activities (100.4) (65.7) (283.2) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (527.9) (520.1) 255.3 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled 667.5 for fiscal 2024, an increase of 136.5 compared to 531.0 for fiscal 2023. This increase was driven by lower accounts receivable, higher gross margin, accounts payable timing, lower payments associated with restructuring activities and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher inventory production, higher payments to customers related to promotional programs and lower income tax refunds received. Lower accounts receivable is driven by the favorable impact of accounts receivable sold under the Master Receivables Purchase Agreement. Accounts payable timing is driven by the impact of extended payment terms with vendors for payments originally due in the final weeks of fiscal 2022 that were paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled 531.0 for fiscal 2023, an increase of 660.0 compared to cash used in operating activities of 129.0 for fiscal 2022. This increase was driven by a reduction in inventory, lower short-term variable cash incentive compensation payouts, higher income tax refunds and lower SG A, partially offset by lower gross margin, higher interest payments, higher payments associated with restructuring activities and accounts payable timing. Accounts payable timing is driven by the unfavorable impact of extended payment terms with vendors for payments originally due in the final weeks of fiscal 2022 that were paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 The seasonal nature of our North America consumer lawn and garden business generally requires cash to fund significant increases in inventories during the first half of the fiscal year. Receivables and payables also build substantially in our second quarter of the fiscal year in line with the timing of sales to support our retailers spring selling season. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities totaled 100.4 for fiscal 2024, an increase of 34.7 compared to 65.7 for fiscal 2023. Cash used for investments in property, plant and equipment during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 was 84.0 and 92.8, respectively. We also acquired an additional equity interest in Bonnie Plants, LLC for 21.4 and had other investing cash inflows of 2.6 during fiscal 2024. 
 Cash used in investing activities totaled 65.7 for fiscal 2023, a decrease of 217.5 compared to 283.2 for fiscal 2022. Cash used for investments in property, plant and equipment during fiscal 2023 was 92.8, a decrease from 113.5 in fiscal 2022 due to higher spending in fiscal 2022 on capital projects to expand network capacity. We also received proceeds of 37.0 during fiscal 2023 related to the payoff of seller financing that we provided in connection with a fiscal 2017 divestiture, and had other investing cash outflows of 12.4 primarily associated with currency forward contracts.

 For the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, we allocated our capital spending as follows: 70 for maintenance of existing productive assets; 20 for cost savings projects, focused primarily on supply chain and information technology; and 10 for innovation and expansion. We expect fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be approximately 100.0 and we expect to allocate approximately 60 to maintenance of existing productive assets, 30 to cost savings projects and 10 to innovation and expansion projects. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities totaled 527.9 for fiscal 2024 compared to 520.1 for fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2024, we had net debt repayments of 391.0, paid dividends of 151.3 and repurchased Common Shares for 5.1 (which includes cash paid to tax authorities to satisfy statutory income tax withholding obligations related to share-based compensation). We also had other financing cash inflows of 15.7 during fiscal 2024 related to collections of previously sold accounts receivable not yet submitted to the buyer. Higher debt repayment is driven by our focus on using available cash flow to reduce our debt. 
 Cash used in financing activities totaled 520.1 for fiscal 2023 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 255.3 for fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2023, we had net debt repayments of 353.6, paid dividends of 149.1, paid financing and issuance fees of 6.4 and repurchased Common Shares for 9.3 (which includes cash paid to tax authorities to satisfy statutory income tax withholding obligations related to share-based compensation). 
 Accounts Receivable Sales 
 On October 27, 2023, we entered into the Master Receivables Purchase Agreement, under which we could sell up to 600.0 of available and eligible outstanding customer accounts receivable generated by sales to four specified customers. On September 1, 2024, we amended the Master Receivables Purchase Agreement to permit us to sell up to 750.0 of available and eligible outstanding customer accounts receivable generated by sales to five specified customers. The agreement is uncommitted and expires on September 1, 2025. The receivable sales are non-recourse to the Company, other than with respect to (i) repurchase obligations and indemnification obligations for any violations by the Company of its respective representations or obligations as seller or servicer and (ii) certain repurchase and payment obligations arising from any dilution of, or dispute with respect to, any purchased receivables that arise after the sale of such purchased receivables to the purchaser not contemplated in the applicable purchase price of such purchased receivable. The recourse obligations of the Company that may arise from time to time are supported by standby letters of credit of 75.0. Transactions under the Master Receivables Purchase Agreement are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable, and the receivables sold are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of the sales transaction. Proceeds received from the sales of accounts receivable are classified as operating cash flows and collections of previously sold accounts receivable not yet submitted to the buyer are classified as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We record the discount on sales in the Other (income) expense, net line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. At September 30, 2024, net receivables of 186.6 were derecognized. During fiscal 2024, proceeds from the sale of receivables under the Master Receivables Purchase Agreement totaled 1,938.6 and the total discount recorded on sales was 24.6. 
 Supplier Finance Program 
 We have an agreement to provide a supplier finance program which facilitates participating suppliers ability to finance our payment obligations with a designated third-party financial institution. Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, elect to finance our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to the participating financial institution. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers decisions to finance amounts under this arrangement. The payment terms that we negotiate with our suppliers are consistent, regardless of whether a supplier participates in the program. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 30 to 60 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. Our outstanding payment obligations under our supplier finance program were 12.5 and 18.3 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are recorded within accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated payments were 245.5 and 185.3 for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively, and are classified as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Share Repurchases 
 On February 6, 2020, Scotts Miracle-Gro announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 750.0 of Common Shares from April 30, 2020 through March 25, 2023. There were no share repurchases under this share repurchase authorization during fiscal 2023 through its expiration on March 25, 2023 . During fiscal 2022, Scotts Miracle-Gro repurchased 1.1 million Common Shares under this share repurchase authorization for 175.0 . Treasury share purchases also include cash paid to tax authorities to satisfy statutory income tax withholding obligations related to share-based compensation of 5.1, 9.3 and 82.9 for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Our cash and cash equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major financial institutions around the world or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments having original maturities of three months or less. The cash and cash equivalents balances of 71.6 and 31.9 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, included 15.9 and 26.6, respectively, held by controlled foreign corporations. As of September 30, 2024, we maintain our assertion of indefinite reinvestment of the earnings of all material foreign subsidiaries. 
 Borrowing Agreements 
 Credit Facilities 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities, which are guaranteed by substantially all of Scotts Miracle-Gro s domestic subsidiaries. On April 8, 2022, we entered into the Sixth A R Credit Agreement, providing the Company and certain of its subsidiaries with five-year senior secured loan facilities in the aggregate principal amount of 2,500.0, comprised of a revolving credit facility of 1,500.0 and a term loan in the original principal amount of 1,000.0 (the Sixth A R Credit Facilities ). The Sixth A R Credit Agreement will terminate on April 8, 2027. The Sixth A R Credit Facilities are available for the issuance of letters of credit up to 100.0. The terms of the Sixth A R Credit Agreement include customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants, and events of default. 
 Under the terms of the Sixth A R Credit Agreement, loans bear interest, at our election, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Spread (each, as defined in the Sixth A R Credit Agreement) or (ii) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such borrowing plus the Applicable Spread (all as defined in the Sixth A R Credit Agreement). Swingline Loans bear interest at the applicable Swingline Rate set forth in the Sixth A R Credit Agreement. Interest rates for other select non-U.S. dollar borrowings, including borrowings denominated in euro, Pounds Sterling and Canadian dollars, are based on separate interest rate indices, as set forth in the Sixth A R Credit Agreement. 
 On June 8, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Sixth A R Credit Agreement Amendment No. 1 ). Amendment No. 1 increased the maximum permitted leverage ratio for the quarterly leverage covenant until April 1, 2024. Amendment No. 1 also increased the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility by 35 bps and the term loan facility by 50 bps, and increased the annual facility fee rate on the revolving credit facility by 15 bps, in each case, when our quarterly-tested leverage ratio exceeded 4.75. 
 On July 31, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Sixth A R Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 2 (i) reduces the revolving loan commitments by 250.0; (ii) increases the maximum permitted leverage ratio for the quarterly leverage covenant until the earlier of (a) October 1, 2025 and (b) subject to certain conditions specified in Amendment No. 2, the termination by the Company of such adjustment (such period, the Leverage Adjustment Period (iii) replaces the interest coverage covenant with a fixed charge coverage covenant; (iv) increases the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility by 25 bps for each existing pricing tier and adds a pricing tier applicable to periods when the leverage ratio exceeds 6.00; (v) limits the amount of certain incremental investments, loans and advances to 25.0 during the Leverage Adjustment Period; and (vi) adds our intellectual property (subject to certain exceptions) as collateral to secure our obligations under the Sixth A R Credit Agreement. Additionally, Amendment No. 2 limits our ability to declare or pay any discretionary dividends, distributions or other restricted payments during the Leverage Adjustment Period to only the payment of (i) regularly scheduled cash dividends to holders of our Common Shares in an aggregate amount not to exceed 225.0 per fiscal year and (ii) other dividends, distributions or restricted payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 25.0. Amendment No. 2 also subjects our ability to make certain investments to pro forma compliance with certain leverage levels specified in Amendment No. 2. Pursuant to Amendment No. 2, the Sixth A R Credit Agreement is secured by (i) a perfected first priority security interest in all of the accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and intellectual property (subject to certain exceptions) of Scotts Miracle-Gro and certain of its domestic subsidiaries and (ii) the pledge of all of the capital stock of certain of Scotts Miracle-Gro s domestic subsidiaries and a portion of the capital stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of 83.0, and had 1,167.0 of borrowing availability under the Sixth A R Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rates on average borrowings under the credit facilities, excluding the impact of interest rate swaps, were 9.1 , 7.6 and 2.8 for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. 
 During fiscal 2024, we used available cash on hand to make repayments on the term loan of the Sixth A R Credit Agreement in the amount of 250.0, which was applied to the outstanding principal amount.

 The Sixth A R Credit Agreement contains, among other obligations, an affirmative covenant regarding our leverage ratio determined as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters calculated as average total indebtedness, divided by our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of Amendment No. 2 Adjusted EBITDA ). Pursuant to Amendment No. 2, the maximum permitted leverage ratio is (i) 6.00 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, (ii) 5.50 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, (iii) 5.25 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, (iv) 5.00 for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, (v) 4.75 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and (vi) 4.50 for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and thereafter. Our leverage ratio was 4.86 at September 30, 2024. Pursuant to Amendment No. 2, the Sixth A R Credit Agreement also contains an affirmative covenant regarding our fixed charge coverage ratio determined as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters, calculated as Adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures and expense for taxes paid in cash, divided by the sum of interest expense plus restricted payments, as described in Amendment No. 2. The minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio is 1.00. Our fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.27 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants in the agreements governing our debt. Based on our projections of financial performance for the twelve-month period subsequent to the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, we expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under the Sixth A R Credit Agreement. However, our assessment of our ability to meet our future obligations is inherently subjective, judgment-based, and susceptible to change based on future events. A covenant violation may result in an event of default. Such a default would allow the lenders under the Sixth A R Credit Agreement to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness thereunder and would also implicate cross-default provisions under the Senior Notes and cause the Senior Notes to become due and payable at that time. As of September 30, 2024, our indebtedness under the Sixth A R Credit Agreement and Senior Notes was 2,225.0. We do not have sufficient cash on hand or available liquidity that can be utilized to repay these outstanding amounts in the event of default. 
 As part of our contingency planning to address potential future circumstances that could result in noncompliance, we have contemplated alternative plans including additional restructuring activities to reduce operating expenses and certain cash management strategies that are within our control. Additionally, we have contemplated alternative plans that are subject to market conditions and not in our control, including, among others, discussions with our lenders to amend the terms of our financial covenants under the Sixth A R Credit Agreement and generating cash by completing other financing transactions, which may include issuing equity. There is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these alternative plans. 
 Senior Notes 
 On December 15, 2016, Scotts Miracle-Gro issued 250.0 aggregate principal amount of 5.250 Senior Notes due 2026. The 5.250 Senior Notes represent general unsecured senior obligations and rank equal in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured senior debt. The 5.250 Senior Notes have interest payment dates of June 15 and December 15 of each year. 
 On October 22, 2019, Scotts Miracle-Gro issued 450.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.500 Senior Notes due 2029. The 4.500 Senior Notes represent general unsecured senior obligations and rank equal in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured senior debt. The 4.500 Senior Notes have interest payment dates of April 15 and October 15 of each year. 
 On March 17, 2021, Scotts Miracle-Gro issued 500.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.000 Senior Notes due 2031. The 4.000 Senior Notes represent general unsecured senior obligations and rank equal in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured senior debt. The 4.000 Senior Notes have interest payment dates of April 1 and October 1 of each year. 
 On August 13, 2021, Scotts Miracle-Gro issued 400.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.375 Senior Notes due 2032. The 4.375 Senior Notes represent general unsecured senior obligations and rank equal in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured senior debt. The 4.375 Senior Notes have interest payment dates of February 1 and August 1 of each year. 
 Substantially all of Scotts Miracle-Gro s directly and indirectly owned domestic subsidiaries serve as guarantors of the 5.250 Senior Notes, the 4.500 Senior Notes, the 4.000 Senior Notes and the 4.375 Senior Notes. 
 The Senior Notes contain an affirmative covenant regarding our interest coverage ratio determined as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters, calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by interest expense excluding costs related to refinancings. The minimum required interest coverage ratio is 2.00. Our interest coverage ratio was 3.57 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024.

 Receivables Facility 
 We also maintained a Master Repurchase Agreement (including the annexes thereto, the Repurchase Agreement and a Master Framework Agreement, as amended (the Framework Agreement and, together with the Repurchase Agreement, the Receivables Facility under which we could sell a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer accounts receivable to the purchasers subject to agreeing to repurchase the receivables on a weekly basis. The eligible accounts receivable consisted of accounts receivable generated by sales to three specified customers. The eligible amount of customer accounts receivables which could be sold under the Receivables Facility was 400.0. The Receivables Facility expired on August 18, 2023. The sale of receivables under the Receivables Facility was accounted for as short-term debt and we continued to carry the receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, primarily as a result of our requirement to repurchase receivables sold. 
 Interest Rate Swap Agreements 
 We enter into interest rate swap agreements with major financial institutions that effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate. Interest payments made between the effective date and expiration date are hedged by the swap agreements. Swap agreements that were hedging interest payments as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 had a maximum total U.S. dollar equivalent notional amount of 450.0 and 600.0, respectively. During fiscal 2024, we terminated an interest rate swap agreement in exchange for a cash payment of 11.0. The notional amount, effective date, expiration date and rate of each of the swap agreements outstanding at September 30, 2024 are shown in the table below: 
 Notional Amount ) Effective Date (a) Expiration Date Fixed Rate 150 6/7/2023 4/7/2027 3.37 50 6/7/2023 4/7/2027 3.34 100 (b) 11/20/2023 3/22/2027 4.74 150 (b) 9/20/2024 9/20/2029 4.25 
 (a) The effective date refers to the date on which interest payments are first hedged by the applicable swap agreement. 
 (b) Notional amount adjusts in accordance with a specified seasonal schedule. This represents the maximum notional amount at any point in time. 
 Availability and Use of Cash 
 We believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our agreements described herein will be sufficient to meet debt service, capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future. However, we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our borrowing agreements in amounts sufficient to pay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. Actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control as further discussed in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our M A, Lending and Financing Activities Our indebtedness could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition of this Form 10-K. 
 Financial Disclosures About Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities 
 The 5.250 Senior Notes, 4.500 Senior Notes, 4.000 Senior Notes and 4.375 Senior Notes were issued by Scotts Miracle-Gro on December 15, 2016, October 22, 2019, March 17, 2021 and August 13, 2021, respectively. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain consolidated domestic subsidiaries of Scotts Miracle-Gro (collectively, the Guarantors and, therefore, we report summarized financial information in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 13-01, Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities Registered or Being Registered. 
 The guarantees are full and unconditional, as those terms are used in Regulation S-X, Rule 3-10(b)(3), except that a Guarantor s guarantee will be released in certain circumstances set forth in the indentures governing the Senior Notes, such as: (i) upon any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to any person other than Scotts Miracle-Gro or any restricted subsidiary under the applicable indenture; (ii) if the Guarantor merges with and into Scotts Miracle-Gro, with Scotts Miracle-Gro surviving such merger; (iii) if the Guarantor is designated an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the applicable indenture or otherwise ceases to be a restricted subsidiary (including by way of liquidation or dissolution) in a transaction permitted by such indenture; (iv) upon legal or covenant defeasance; (v) at the election of Scotts Miracle-Gro following the Guarantor s release as a guarantor under the Sixth A R Credit Agreement, except a release by or as a result of the repayment of the Sixth A R Credit Agreement; or (vi) if the Guarantor ceases to be a restricted subsidiary and the Guarantor is not otherwise required to provide a guarantee of the Senior Notes pursuant to the applicable indenture.

 Our foreign subsidiaries and certain of our domestic subsidiaries are not guarantors (collectively, the Non-Guarantors of the Senior Notes. Payments on the Senior Notes are only required to be made by Scotts Miracle-Gro and the Guarantors. As a result, no payments are required to be made from the assets of the Non-Guarantors, unless those assets are transferred by dividend or otherwise to Scotts Miracle-Gro or a Guarantor. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization of any of the Non-Guarantors, holders of their indebtedness, including their trade creditors and other obligations, will be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of the Non-Guarantors before any assets are made available for distribution to Scotts Miracle-Gro or the Guarantors. As a result, the Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all the liabilities of the Non-Guarantors. 
 The guarantees may be subject to review under federal bankruptcy laws or relevant state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws. In certain circumstances, the court could void the guarantee, subordinate the amounts owing under the guarantee, or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Senior Notes. 
 As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee to the extent such Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit from the issuance of the Senior Notes. 
 The measure of insolvency varies depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied. Regardless of the measure being applied, a court could determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on the date the guarantee was issued, so that payments to the holders of the Senior Notes would constitute a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyances on other grounds. If a guarantee is voided as a fraudulent conveyance or is found to be unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the Senior Notes will not have a claim against the Guarantor. 
 Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the Guarantor s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. Moreover, this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws. There is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. 
 The following tables present summarized financial information on a combined basis for Scotts Miracle-Gro and the Guarantors.

 Judicial and Administrative Proceedings 
 We are party to various pending judicial and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, among others, proceedings based on accidents or product liability claims and alleged violations of environmental laws. We have reviewed these pending judicial and administrative proceedings, including the probable outcomes, reasonably anticipated costs and expenses, and the availability and limits of our insurance coverage, and have established what we believe to be appropriate accruals. We believe that our assessment of contingencies is reasonable and that the related accruals, in the aggregate, are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that future quarterly or annual operating results will not be materially affected by these proceedings, whether as a result of adverse outcomes or as a result of significant defense costs.

 Contractual Obligations 
 The following table summarizes our future cash outflows for contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024: 
 Payments Due by Period Contractual Cash Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Debt obligations 2,225.0 50.0 825.0 1,350.0 Interest expense on debt obligations 501.0 112.7 194.8 121.7 71.8 Finance lease obligations 21.5 3.4 5.6 3.9 8.6 Operating lease obligations 340.9 89.8 122.7 65.9 62.5 Purchase obligations 681.2 310.9 272.7 63.9 33.7 Other, primarily retirement plan obligations 46.5 5.1 9.7 9.6 22.1 Total contractual cash obligations 3,816.1 571.9 1,430.5 265.0 1,548.7 
 We had long-term debt obligations and interest payments due primarily under the 5.250 Senior Notes, 4.500 Senior Notes, 4.000 Senior Notes, 4.375 Senior Notes and our credit facilities. Amounts in the table represent scheduled future maturities of debt principal for the periods indicated. 
 The interest payments for our credit facilities are based on outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024. Actual interest expense will likely be higher due to the seasonality of our business and associated higher average borrowings. 
 Purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes, including urea and packaging, as well as commitments for warehouse services, grass seed, marketing services and information technology services which comprise the unconditional purchase obligations disclosed in NOTE 18. COMMITMENTS of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. 
 Other obligations include actuarially determined retiree benefit payments and pension funding to comply with local funding requirements. Pension funding requirements are based on preliminary estimates using actuarial assumptions determined as of September 30, 2024. These amounts represent expected payments through 2034. Based on the accounting rules for defined benefit pension plans and retirement health care plans, the liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets differ from these expected future payments (see NOTE 9. RETIREMENT PLANS and NOTE 10. ASSOCIATE MEDICAL BENEFITS of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K). The above table excludes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and insurance accruals as we are unable to estimate the timing of payments for these items. 

Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to local, state, federal and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and believe we are operating in substantial compliance, or taking actions aimed at ensuring compliance with, such laws and regulations. We are involved in several legal actions with various governmental agencies related to environmental matters. While it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of actions involving these environmental matters, particularly remediation costs at waste disposal sites and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters, taking into account established accruals, is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that the resolution of these matters will not materially affect our future quarterly or annual results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Additional information on environmental matters affecting us is provided in ITEM 1. BUSINESS Regulatory Considerations and ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS of this Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires management to use judgment and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. By their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty. We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances at the time the estimate was made. Certain accounting estimates are particularly significant, including those related to revenue recognition and promotional allowances, income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

 We believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable in that they were based on information available when the estimates, assumptions and judgments were made. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ materially from those implied by our assumptions and estimates. 
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Scotts Miracle-Gro reviews our critical accounting estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition and promotional allowances, income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 Revenue Recognition and Promotional Allowances 
 Our revenue is primarily generated from sales of branded and private label lawn and garden care and indoor and hydroponic gardening finished products. Product sales are recognized at a point in time when control of products transfers to customers and we have no further obligation to provide services related to such products. Sales are typically recognized when products are delivered to or picked up by the customer. We are generally the principal in a transaction and, therefore, primarily record revenue on a gross basis. Revenue for product sales is recorded net of sales returns and allowances. Revenues are measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive as derived from a list price, reduced by estimates for variable consideration. Variable consideration includes the cost of current and continuing promotional programs and expected sales returns. 
 Our promotional programs primarily include rebates based on sales volumes, in-store promotional allowances, cooperative advertising programs, direct consumer rebate programs and special purchasing incentives. The cost of promotional programs is estimated considering all reasonably available information, including current expectations and historical experience. Promotional costs (including allowances and rebates) incurred during the year are expensed to interim periods in relation to revenues and are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Provisions for estimated returns and allowances are recorded at the time revenue is recognized based on historical rates and are periodically adjusted for known changes in return levels. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as contract fulfillment costs and included in the Cost of sales line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We exclude from revenue any amounts collected from customers for sales or other taxes. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our annual effective tax rate is established based on our pre-tax income (loss), statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. We record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations. A deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to the balances that are more likely than not to be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we take into account many factors, including the specific tax jurisdiction, both historical and projected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods and tax planning strategies. Many of the judgments made in adjusting valuation allowances involve assumptions and estimates that are highly subjective. When we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded, the asset balance and Consolidated Statements of Operations reflect the change in the period such determination is made. Due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments involved in determining the proper valuation allowances, differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to these valuation allowances. 
 We also establish a liability for tax return positions in which there is uncertainty as to whether or not the position will ultimately be sustained. These uncertain tax positions are adjusted as a result of changes in factors such as tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, new audit developments, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations. Amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted in quarters when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled. Many of the judgments made in adjusting uncertain tax positions involve assumptions and estimates regarding audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements, which are often uncertain and subject to change. 
 Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 We have significant investments in intangible assets and goodwill. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset testing as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. In our evaluation of impairment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we perform either an initial qualitative or quantitative evaluation for each of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Factors considered in the qualitative test include operating results as well as new events and circumstances impacting the operations or cash flows of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets. For the quantitative test, the review for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is based on an income-based approach, including the relief-from-royalty method for indefinite-lived trade names. If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit or intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value.

 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 

 Under the income-based approach, we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to revenue and profitability growth rates, based upon annual budgets and longer-range strategic plans, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. These budgets and plans are used for internal purposes and are also the basis for communication with outside parties about future business trends. Fair value estimates employed in our annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill were determined using models involving several assumptions. Changes in our assumptions could materially impact our fair value estimates. Assumptions critical to our fair value estimates were: (i) discount rates; (ii) royalty rates used in our intangible asset valuations; (iii) projected future revenues and profitability; and (iv) projected long-term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values. These and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances. While we believe the assumptions we used to estimate future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized. As a result, impairment charges that possibly would have been recognized in earlier periods may not be recognized until later periods if actual results deviate unfavorably from earlier estimates. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted cash flows or earnings projections and, therefore, could change impairment determinations. 
 At September 30, 2024, goodwill totaled 243.9, all of which was associated with our U.S. Consumer segment. Based on the results of the annual quantitative evaluation for fiscal 2024, the fair value of our U.S. Consumer segment reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would not have resulted in an impairment for this reporting unit. 
 At September 30, 2024, indefinite-lived intangible assets consisted of trade names of 168.2 and the Roundup marketing agreement amendment of 155.7, all of which were associated with our U.S. Consumer segment. Based on the results of the annual quantitative evaluation for fiscal 2024, the fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets substantially exceeded their respective carrying values. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would not have resulted in an impairment of any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 Other Significant Accounting Policies 
 Other significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed above, are also critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements. The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K contain additional information related to our accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, and should be read in conjunction with this discussion.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 As part of our ongoing business, we are exposed to certain market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Financial derivatives and other instruments are used to manage these risks. These instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The following table summarizes information about our debt instruments and derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. For debt instruments, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swap agreements, the table presents expected cash flows based on notional amounts and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates. We have outstanding interest rate swap agreements with major financial institutions that effectively convert a portion of the Company s variable-rate debt to a fixed rate. The swap agreements had a maximum total U.S. dollar equivalent notional amount of 450.0 and 600.0 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Weighted-average variable rates are based on rates in effect at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Assuming average unhedged variable interest rate borrowing levels during fiscal 2024 of 575.0, a change in our variable interest rate of 100 basis points for a full twelve-month period would have an impact of 5.8 on interest expense. 
 Expected Maturity Date (Fiscal Year) Total Fair Value 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 After Long-term debt: Fixed rate debt 250.0 1,350.0 1,600.0 1,507.1 Average rate 5.3 4.3 4.4 Variable rate debt 50.0 50.0 525.0 625.0 625.0 Average rate 7.5 7.5 7.5 7.5 Interest rate derivatives: Interest rate swaps (1.0) (1.0) (1.1) (0.7) (0.6) (4.4) (4.4) Average rate 3.7 3.7 3.9 4.2 4.2 3.9 
 Expected Maturity Date (Fiscal Year) Total Fair Value 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 After Long-term debt: Fixed rate debt 250.0 1,350.0 1,600.0 1,283.9 Average rate 5.3 4.3 4.4 Variable rate debt 50.0 50.0 50.0 863.3 1,013.3 1,013.3 Average rate 8.2 8.2 8.2 8.1 8.1 Interest rate derivatives: Interest rate swaps 13.1 9.3 7.5 1.5 31.4 31.4 Average rate 1.6 2.1 2.3 3.4 2.1 
 
 Excluded from the information provided above are miscellaneous debt instruments of 0.0 and 0.4 and finance lease obligations of 17.8 and 16.9 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Other Market Risks 
 We are subject to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating prices of certain raw materials, including urea and other fertilizer inputs, resins, diesel, gasoline, natural gas, sphagnum peat, bark and grass seed. Refer to NOTE 15. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for discussion of these market risks and the derivatives used to manage these risks.

 ANNUAL REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL 
 CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company and our consolidated subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company and our consolidated subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company and our consolidated subsidiaries, as appropriate; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company and our consolidated subsidiaries that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management s assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies and our overall control environment. This assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed under the direction of management. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. 
 Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We reviewed the results of management s assessment with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, independently audited our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 and has issued their attestation report which appears herein.

 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company s equity method investment in Bonnie Plants, LLC Bonnie Investment is recorded in the Investment in unconsolidated affiliates line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded pre-tax impairment charges of 61.9 million associated with this investment in the Equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment charges were driven by revisions to the Company s internal forecasts for Bonnie Plants, LLC in response to decreased sales volume and inflationary cost pressures. The estimated fair value of the Bonnie Investment was based upon an equal weighting of the income-based and market-based approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to the forecasted operating performance of the Bonnie Investment. The fair value estimate utilizes significant unobservable inputs and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
 
 Evaluating the indicators of potential other-than-temporary impairment and calculating an other-than-temporary impairment involves significant and complex management judgment. Therefore, a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the conclusions reached around whether these impairment indicators resulted in an other-than-temporary impairment and the appropriateness of management s assumptions used in the calculation of the other-than-temporary impairment charge, including the need to involve fair value specialists. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to management s assessment of identified impairment indicators, the conclusions reached around whether these impairment indicators resulted in an other-than-temporary impairment, and the determination of the fair value of the investment, included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management s other-than-temporary impairment evaluation of the Bonnie Investment, and controls over management s determination of various critical assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the investment, such as the controls related to the development of revenue and EBITDA forecasts, valuation multiples, long-term growth rate, discount for lack of marketability, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, and the guideline public companies. 
 
 We performed inquiries with relevant members of management to obtain an understanding of their current and expected performance for the investment, including their understanding of any operational and strategic changes, corroborated by inspection of the investee s internal communications to its board of directors. 
 
 We evaluated management s impairment analysis by assessing whether certain indicators were present and whether those indicators implied an other-than-temporary loss of value. 
 
 We evaluated the sensitivity of various key assumptions used in the valuation, such as the revenue growth rate, EBITDA margin, revenue and EBITDA multiples, long-term growth rate, discount for lack of marketability, and the discount rate, including the company specific risk premium. 
 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of the assumptions within the valuation analysis by: 
 
 Evaluating the reasonableness of management s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical results, (2) the investee s internal communications to management and its board of directors, and (3) forecasted information included in industry reports and companies in its peer group. 
 
 Evaluating the impact of changes in management s assumptions from prior estimates of fair value.

Table of Contents 

 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology and valuation assumptions by: 
 
 Testing the source information and verifying the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. 
 
 Developing a range of independent estimates for significant assumptions, such as, the long-term growth rate, discount for lack of marketability, and the discount rate, which considers the company specific risk premium, and comparing those to the assumptions selected by management. 
 
 Evaluating the selected revenue and EBITDA multiples, including testing the underlying source information and mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and comparing the multiples selected by management to its guideline companies. 
 
 We tested the mathematical accuracy of the overall valuation analysis and the resulting estimated fair value of the investment, in comparison to the investment s carrying value, to calculate the resulting impairment.

 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Annual Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

for awards granted to officers and other associates and for awards granted to non-employee directors. 
 For restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance-based award units that do not contain a market condition, the fair value of each award is estimated on the grant date based on the current market price of the Common Shares. For performance-based award units that contain a market condition, the fair value of each award is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Expected market price volatility is based on historical volatility specific to the Common Shares. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The grant date fair value of stock option awards is estimated using a binomial model. Expected market price volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Common Shares and historical volatility specific to the Common Shares. Historical data, including demographic factors impacting historical exercise behavior, is used to estimate stock option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected life of stock options is based on historical experience and expectations for grants outstanding. 
 Vesting of performance-based award units depends on service and achievement of specified performance targets. Based on the extent to which the targets are achieved, vested shares may range from to of the target award amount. For performance-based award units that do not contain a market condition, the total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects management s assessment of the probability that performance goals will be achieved. A cumulative adjustment is recognized to compensation expense in the current period to reflect any changes in the probability of achievement of performance goals. For performance-based award units that contain a market condition, compensation expense is recognized regardless of the extent to which the targets are achieved. 
 Restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance-based award units receive dividend equivalents equal to the cash dividends earned during the vesting period that are only paid out upon vesting. Share-based award units are generally forfeited if a holder terminates employment or service with the Company prior to the vesting date, except in cases where associates are eligible for accelerated vesting based on having satisfied retirement requirements relating to age and years of service. The Company estimates that of its share-based awards will be forfeited based on an analysis of historical trends. The Company evaluates the estimated forfeiture rate on an annual basis and makes adjustments as appropriate. Stock options have exercise prices equal to the market price of the underlying Common Shares on the grant date and a term of years. If available, Scotts Miracle-Gro typically uses treasury shares, or if not available, newly-issued Common Shares, to settle vested share-based awards. The Company classifies share-based compensation expense within cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses to correspond with the same line item as cash compensation paid to associates. Cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of the cumulative compensation cost recognized for share-based awards (excess tax benefits) are classified as operating cash inflows.

 During fiscal 2023, the Company identified circumstances that indicated the carrying amounts of Hawthorne s long-lived assets, including trade names and customer relationships, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed a recoverability test for long-lived assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company concluded that the carrying value of these long-lived assets exceeded their estimated fair value and recorded non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges of related to trade names and related to customer relationships during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 in the Impairment, restructuring and other line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair values of long-lived assets were determined using income-based approaches, including the relief-from-royalty method for trade names, that include market participant expectations of cash flows that the assets will generate over the remaining useful life discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. These fair value estimates utilize significant unobservable inputs and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements.

The estimated fair value of the Other segment reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income-based and market-based approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit. The fair value estimate utilizes significant unobservable inputs and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement.

In addition, THC is entitled to designate nominees to the RIV Capital board of directors for so long as the board is comprised of directors, and will be entitled to designate nominees to the RIV Capital board of directors if the size of the board is increased to directors.

 The Company has been named as a defendant in a number of cases alleging injuries that the lawsuits claim resulted from exposure to asbestos-containing products, apparently based on the Company s historic use of vermiculite in certain of its products. In many of these cases, the complaints are not specific about the plaintiffs contacts with the Company or its products. The cases vary, but complaints in these cases generally seek unspecified monetary damages (actual, compensatory, consequential and punitive) from multiple defendants. The Company believes that the claims against it are without merit and is vigorously defending against them. The Company has not recorded any accruals in its consolidated financial statements as the likelihood of a loss from these cases is not probable at this time. The Company does not believe a reasonably possible loss would be material to the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these cases will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. There can be no assurance that future developments related to pending claims or claims filed in the future, whether as a result of adverse outcomes or as a result of significant defense costs, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 On June 6, 2024, a purported shareholder filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-03132) on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of Common Shares between November 3, 2021, and August 1, 2023. On July 26, 2024, another purported shareholder filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-03766) on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of Common Shares between June 2, 2021, and August 1, 2023. These lawsuits, which will likely be consolidated with any subsequently filed lawsuits alleging similar facts, assert claims under Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5 and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act against the Company and certain of its current and former officers based on alleged misstatements about the Company s inventories, sales and business prospects. The actions seek, among other things, unspecified monetary damages, reasonable costs and expenses and equitable/injunctive or other relief as deemed appropriate by the Court. The Company believes that the claims asserted are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions. 
 On July 3, 2024, a purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-03636), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On July 30, 2024, a second purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No.1:24-cv-00402), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On August 23, 2024, a third purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-03880), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On September 9, 2024, a fourth purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Union County (Ohio) Court of Common Pleas (Case No. 24CV0193), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On September 26, 2024, a fifth purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Union County (Ohio) Court of Common Pleas (Case No. 24CV0203), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On November 19, 2024, a sixth purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-04180), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. On November 22, 2024, a seventh purported shareholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Case No. 2:24-cv-04190), purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors. The federal lawsuits will likely be consolidated with one another, along with any subsequently filed federal lawsuits alleging similar facts, and the state court lawsuits will likely be consolidated with one another, along with any subsequently filed state lawsuits alleging similar facts. All of the lawsuits include allegations that generally mirror those asserted in the securities lawsuits described above and assert claims for breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment, as well as abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. The federal lawsuits also assert claims under Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5, Section 14(a), Rule 14a-9, and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, and contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act. The actions seek a judgment in favor of the Company for damages in an unspecified amount, disgorgement, interest, and costs and expenses, including attorneys and experts fees.

Exhibit 4.6 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 
 As of September 30, 2024, The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company Scotts, the Company, we, us or our had one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended our common shares, without par value (our common shares ). 
 The following summary describes the material features of our common shares and our preferred shares, without par value (our preferred shares ). This summary does not describe every aspect of our common shares or preferred shares and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of our amended articles of incorporation and code of regulations, each of which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the applicable provisions of Ohio law. 
 Authorized Capital Stock 
 Under our amended articles of incorporation, we have the authority to issue up to an aggregate amount of 100,000,000 common shares and 195,000 preferred shares. As of September 30, 2024, there were 57,115,475 common shares issued and outstanding and no preferred shares issued and outstanding. 
 Common Shares 
 Holders of our common shares are entitled to 
 one vote for each share held 
 
 receive dividends when and if declared by our board of directors from funds legally available therefor, subject to the rights of holders of our preferred shares, if any, and any restrictions contained in our long-term indebtedness and 
 
 share ratably in our net assets, legally available to our shareholders in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, after provision for distribution to the holders of any preferred shares and to the payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to creditors or provision for such payment. 
 
 Holders of our common shares have no preemptive, subscription, redemption, conversion or cumulative voting rights. All of our outstanding common shares are fully paid and non-assessable. Our amended articles of incorporation contain no restrictions on the alienability of our common shares. 
 Our common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the symbol SMG. 
 Preferred Shares 
 Under our amended articles of incorporation, our board of directors is authorized to issue, without any further vote or action by our shareholders, subject to certain limitations prescribed by Ohio law and the rules and regulations of the NYSE, up to an aggregate of 195,000 preferred shares in one or more series. Our board of directors is also authorized to fix or change the rights, preferences and limitations of each series, including the division of such shares into series and the designation and authorized number of each series, dividend and distribution rights, liquidation rights, preferences and price, redemption rights and price, sinking fund requirements, voting rights, preemptive rights, conversion rights and restrictions on issuance of shares. Absent a determination by the board of directors to establish different voting rights, holders of preferred shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters to be voted upon by the holders of common shares and preferred shares voting together as a single class. Ohio law also entitles the holders of preferred shares to exercise a class vote on certain matters. 
 Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred shares with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common shares. The issuance of preferred shares could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common shares. The issuance of preferred shares also could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of us without further action by our shareholders. 

Anti-Takeover Effects of Amended Articles of Incorporation, Code of Regulations and Ohio Law 
 Certain provisions in our amended articles of incorporation and code of regulations and the Ohio Revised Code could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by shareholders to change management more difficult. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of our shares. A description of these provisions is set forth below. 
 Classified Board of Directors 
 Our board of directors is divided into three classes, with three-year staggered terms. This classification system increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors at any one time and may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to gain control of us. It also may maintain the incumbency of our board of directors. Under the Ohio General Corporation Law, our shareholders may not remove any directors on our classified board of directors without cause. 
 Supermajority Voting Provisions 
 Under the Ohio General Corporation Law, in the case of most mergers, sales of all or substantially all the assets of a corporation and amendments to a corporation s articles of incorporation, the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the voting power of the corporation is required unless the corporation s articles of incorporation provide for a lower amount not less than a majority. Our amended articles of incorporation change the default voting requirement provided by the Ohio General Corporation Law to a majority of the voting power, except that the affirmative vote of two-thirds of our voting power is required with respect to any of the following 
 proposed amendments to the supermajority voting provision in our amended articles of incorporation 
 
 an agreement of merger or consolidation providing for the proposed merger or consolidation of us with or into one or more other corporations and requiring shareholder approval 
 
 a proposed combination or majority share acquisition involving the issuance of our shares and requiring shareholder approval 
 
 a proposal to sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, of our assets, with or without goodwill and 
 
 a proposed dissolution of us. 
 
 Limited Shareholder Action by Written Consent 
 The Ohio General Corporation Law requires that an action by written consent of the shareholders in lieu of a meeting be unanimous, except that the code of regulations may be amended by an action by written consent of holders of shares entitling them to exercise two-thirds of the voting power of the corporation or, if the articles of incorporation or code of regulations otherwise provide, such greater or lesser amount, but not less than a majority. This provision may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider to be in its best interest. 
 Control Share Acquisition Act 
 The Ohio General Corporation Law provides that certain notice and informational filings, and special shareholder meeting and voting procedures, must occur prior to any person s acquisition of an issuer s shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise or direct the voting power of the issuer in the election of directors within any of the following ranges 
 one-fifth or more but less than one-third of such voting power 
 
 one-third or more but less than a majority of such voting power and 
 
 a majority or more of such voting power. 
 
 This provision, which is known as the Control Share Acquisition Act, does not apply to a corporation if its articles of incorporation or code of regulations so provide. We have not opted out of the application of the Control Share Acquisition Act. 

Merger Moratorium Statute 
 Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code, known as the Merger Moratorium Statute, prohibits specified business combinations and other transactions (including mergers, consolidations, asset sales, loans, disproportionate distributions of property and disproportionate issuances or transfers of shares or rights to acquire shares) between an Ohio corporation and an Interested Shareholder (as such term is defined in Section 1704.01 of the Ohio Revised Code) for a period of three years after a person becomes an Interested Shareholder, unless, prior to such date, the directors approved either the business combination or other transaction or approved the acquisition that caused the person to become an Interested Shareholder. Under the Merger Moratorium Statute, an Interested Shareholder generally includes any beneficial owner of shares of an Ohio corporation who, alone or with others, may exercise or direct the exercise of at least 10 of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors. 
 Following the three-year moratorium period, the corporation may engage in the covered transaction with the Interested Shareholder only if 
 the transaction receives the approval of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise at least two-thirds of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors (or a different proportion specified in the corporation s articles of incorporation), including at least a majority of the voting shares held by persons other than an Interested Shareholder or 
 
 the remaining shareholders receive an amount for their shares equal to the higher of the highest amount paid in the past by the Interested Shareholder for the corporation s shares or the amount that would be due to the shareholders if the corporation were to dissolve. 
 
 The Merger Moratorium Statute does not apply to a corporation if its articles of incorporation or code of regulations so provide. We have not opted out of the application of the Merger Moratorium Statute.

Exhibit 10.10 
 
 Summary of Compensation for Nonemployee Directors of 
 The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company 
 Effective as of January 22, 2024 
 _____________________________________ 
 
 At the meeting of the Board of Directors (the Board of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (the Company held on January 22, 2024, the Board approved the recommendations of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board (the Committee with respect to compensation for the calendar year for nonemployee members of the Board Nonemployee Directors and the Lead Independent Director of the Company. The compensation approved by the Board is described below. 
 
 Annual Cash Retainer Reimbursement of Expenses 
 
 Each of the Nonemployee Directors is normally paid an annual cash retainer in the amount of 115,000 that is paid in quarterly increments of 28,750 in February, April, July and October. However, for calendar 2024, the Nonemployee Directors have the option to elect, in advance, to defer 100 of their quarterly cash retainers, in exchange for fully-vested deferred stock units that will settle on or after January 31, 2027, at the election of the Nonemployee Director. As an inducement for the Nonemployee Directors to defer all of their cash compensation in calendar 2024, the deferred quarterly cash retainer amount of 28,750 was enhanced by 15 each quarter prior to converting the cash to deferred stock units. Nonemployee Directors receive reimbursement of all reasonable travel and other expenses associated with attending Board and Board committee meetings. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 
 Shortly following each of the Company s annual meetings (a) each Nonemployee Director will be granted restricted stock units having a grant date value of 210,000, with no additional restricted stock units awarded for serving as Board committee chairs or members and (b) the Lead Independent Director will be granted additional restricted stock units having a grant date value of 50,000. The number of restricted stock units (and related dividend equivalents) granted to each Nonemployee Director will be calculated by dividing the aggregate value of restricted stock units to be granted to such Nonemployee Director by the closing price of the Company s common shares on the grant date and rounding any resulting fractional restricted stock unit up to the next whole restricted stock unit. 
 
 The restricted stock units (and related dividend equivalents) will be granted under The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company Long-Term Incentive Plan (Effective as of January 22, 2024) (the 2024 Plan ). Each whole restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one full common share of the Company at the time and in the manner described in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement for Nonemployee Directors (with Related Dividend Equivalents) evidencing the award. Each dividend equivalent represents the right to receive additional restricted stock units (rounded to the nearest whole restricted stock unit) in respect of dividends that are declared and paid during the period beginning on the grant date and ending on the settlement date with respect to the common shares of the Company represented by the related restricted stock units. 
 
 The restricted stock units, including any restricted stock units received in respect of dividend equivalents on or prior to the vesting date, will generally become 100 vested on the first anniversary of the grant date (the Vesting Date ). Any restricted stock units received in respect of dividend equivalents 

following the vesting date will be 100 vested on the date they are credited to the Nonemployee Director. If a Nonemployee Director ceases to be a member of the Board as a result of their death or becoming totally disabled, then all of the Nonemployee Director s restricted stock units (and related dividend equivalents) will become 100 vested as of the date the Nonemployee Director s service on the Board terminates. If a Nonemployee Director ceases to be a member of the Board prior to the Vesting Date for any reason other than a change in control of the Company (except as provided above for death or disability), the Nonemployee Director s restricted stock units (and related dividend equivalents) will be immediately forfeited. 
 
 Subject to the terms of the 2024 Plan and the applicable restricted stock unit award agreement, vested restricted stock units (and related dividend equivalents) will be settled in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable following the earliest to occur of (a) termination, (b) death, (c) disability, or (d) the third anniversary of the grant date unless the Nonemployee Director elected, in advance, to defer settlement of the restricted stock units to a later date. Whole restricted stock units (and related dividend equivalents) will be settled in full common shares of the Company and any fractional restricted stock units will be settled in cash, determined based on the fair market value of a common share of the Company on the settlement date. 
 
 If there is a Change in Control (as defined in the 2024 Plan), each Nonemployee Director s restricted stock units (and related dividend equivalents) will become 100 vested on the date of the Change in Control and will be settled within 30-days of the Change in Control. 
 
 For more information about the restricted stock units (and related dividend equivalents) granted to the Nonemployee Directors, please refer to (a) the Form of Deferred Stock Unit Award Agreement for Nonemployee Director Retainer Deferral (with Related Dividend Equivalents) that is included as Exhibit 10.3 to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 24, 2024 (b) the Form of Standard Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement for Nonemployee Directors (with Related Dividend Equivalents) that is included as Exhibit 10.2 to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 24, 2024 and (c) the 2024 Plan that is included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 24, 2024.

 CORPORATE POLICY W-LG-1 INSIDER TRADING POLICY 

To All Scotts Associates Date April 22, 2024 From Matthew E. Garth, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer 
 Dimiter Todorov, Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer 

ScottsMiracle-Gro s Principle 
 The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company is committed to full compliance with the U.S. Federal and State securities laws and regulations. The securities laws dealing with trading in securities are intended to ensure the maintenance of fair and honest stock markets. Conduct that violates the securities laws can subject individuals, as well as the Company, to civil and criminal penalties and is contrary to the values of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

GENERAL POLICY 
 
 In the course of business operations, associates and members of the Board of Directors of the Company Directors may become aware of material, non-public inside information about the Company or about another public company, whether favorable or unfavorable. It is particularly important that all associates and Directors (and others who may become involved in these matters such as consultants and independent contractors) recognize the sensitivity of confidential business information and conduct themselves accordingly. The misuse of material, non-public information can have serious, undesirable consequences. In the case of trading in securities based on inside information or providing such information to other persons who may trade on the basis of that information, such consequences may include termination of employment, other adverse employment consequences, and criminal and civil penalties. 
 
 COVERAGE 
 
 Unlawful insider trading occurs when a person uses material non-public information obtained through their employment or other involvement with the Company to make decisions to purchase, sell or otherwise engage in transactions in that Company s securities or to provide that information to others outside the Company. The prohibitions against insider trading apply to trading or otherwise transacting in the Company s securities, tipping and making recommendations to engage in 

transactions by virtually any person, including all persons associated with the Company, if the information involved is material and non-public. These terms are defined below. 
 
 This Policy applies to (1) all Directors (2) all associates of the Company and the Company s direct and indirect subsidiaries (wherever located) (3) all Family Members (as defined below) of Directors and associates (4) all corporations, partnerships, trusts or other entities controlled by any of the above persons (or controlled by a group comprising two or more of any of the above persons) and (5) any other person or entity as designated from time to time by the General Counsel. This Policy shall continue to apply to a Director or associate, such individual s Family Members and all corporations, partnerships, trusts or other entities controlled by such individual even after such Director s or associate s separation from service to the Company. If a Director or associate is in possession of material nonpublic information when his or her service terminates, that individual, such individual s Family Members and all corporations, partnerships, trusts or other entities controlled by such individual may not trade in Company securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. The pre-clearance procedures specified for Designated Persons (as described below) will cease to apply to transactions in Company securities upon the expiration of any blackout period applicable at the time of the separation of such Director s or associate s service as a Director or associate of the Company. 
 
 This Policy does not apply to a partnership of which any of the persons identified in clauses (1), (2) or (3) is a non-controlling general or limited partner, it being understood that transactions in Company securities by such partnership that are for the account of such non-controlling general or limited partner identified in clauses (1), (2) or (3) shall be deemed for purposes of this Policy to be transactions directly by that person (and not the partnership) and as such covered by this Policy. 
 
 The term Family Members includes (1) a person s family members who share the same address as, or who are financially dependent upon, that person (2) any unrelated person who shares the same address as the person (other than employees or tenants) and (3) any family members who do not live with the covered person but whose transactions in the Company s securities are directed by the covered person or subject to that person s influence or control. You are responsible for the transactions of your Family Members and, therefore, should make them aware of the need to confer with you before they trade in Company securities, and you should treat all such transactions for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if the transactions were for your own account. This Policy does not, however, apply to personal securities transactions by Family Members where the purchase or sale decision is made by a third party not controlled by, influenced by or related to you or your Family Members (e.g., transactions pursuant to a trading plan compliant with Rule 10b5-1 or a trust operated and controlled by a third party not controlled by, influenced or related to you or your Family Members). 
 
 In all cases, the duty to comply or cause compliance with this Policy resides in the Director or associate.

SPECIFIC GUIDANCE 
 
 Materiality Confidentiality and When Information is Considered Public 
 
 1. All material, non-public information about the Company, whether favorable or unfavorable, is to be kept confidential until publicly disclosed by the Company. Similarly, all material, non-public information about other companies with which the Company does business, whether favorable or unfavorable, is to be kept confidential until publicly disclosed. 
 
 2. In general, information is considered material if a reasonable person would attach importance to the information in determining whether to purchase or sell a company s securities. Any information that could be expected to affect the Company s stock price, whether positive or negative, should be considered material. There is no bright-line standard for assessing materiality rather, materiality is based on an assessment of all of the facts and circumstances, and is often evaluated by enforcement authorities with the benefit of hindsight. Without attempting to list all types of material information, such information includes 
 
 a. Company earnings, possible dividend increases or decreases, and other financial information 
 
 b. Significant positive or negative variances to plan in consumer purchase activity, as measured by retailer point of sale, in peak lawn and garden season months 
 
 c. Any technological or similar break through which, when made public, could affect a company s stock price 
 
 d. The fact that an acquisition candidate of material importance or a material divestiture is being evaluated or considered, that discussions or negotiations are in progress, and any information relating to such matters 
 
 e. Changes in senior management and 
 
 f. Entry into, or termination of, a significant contract. 
 
 3. Confidential information concerning such matters is to be restricted to those associates and agents who have a need to know for the proper performance of their respective functions. 
 
 4. Management and each associate should exercise due care in protecting the confidentiality of such matters. In particular, 
 
 a. casual conversations in public areas are to be avoided and 
 
 b. files containing material, non-public information should be stored in secured places. 
 
 3 

5. Information that has not been disclosed to the public is generally considered to be non-public information. In order to establish that information has been disclosed to the public, it may be necessary to demonstrate that the information has been widely disseminated. Once information has been widely disseminated to the public, it is still necessary to afford the investing public with sufficient time to absorb the information. As a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed by the marketplace until one complete trading day has concluded after the information is released. If the information is released once a trading day has commenced, the information is not considered absorbed until the conclusion of the next trading day. 
 
 A trading day is any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. 
 
 Restrictions on Trading in Securities 
 
 1. Trading in Company Securities . No person subject to this Policy may buy, sell or make bona fide gifts of securities of the Company while aware of material, non-public or inside information concerning the Company. Designated Persons are subject to additional procedures specified below. It is the responsibility of each person subject to this policy to determine whether they are aware of material, non-public or inside information concerning the Company and, if so, to abstain from trading in Company securities. 
 
 2. Trading in the Securities of Other Companies . No person subject to this Policy who knows of a possible acquisition should make any trades in the securities of the acquisition candidate regardless of whether the acquisition is considered material to The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company or its subsidiaries. Similarly, no person subject to this Policy who becomes aware of material, non-public information relating to another company with which the Company transacts business or competes should make any trades in the securities of such company. 
 
 3. Prohibition on Short Sales . No person subject to this Policy may engage in short sales of Company securities. A short sale is the sale of a security that the seller does not own at the time of the trade the sale is often accomplished using a security borrowed from a broker, and the seller is required to purchase the security at some time in the future to cover the sale. 
 
 4. Prohibition on Options Transactions . No person subject to this Policy may engage in transactions in puts, calls or other derivatives that relate to or involve Company securities. A put or call option gives the holder of the option the right to sell (put) or purchase (call) securities within a certain time period at a specified price. Such transactions are, in effect, bets on the short-term movement of the Company s stock and, therefore, create the appearance that trading is based on non-public information. 
 
 5. Prohibition on Hedging Company Securities . Certain transactions, such as forward sale or purchase contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds, allow an individual to hedge against decreases in the market value of Company securities held by or granted to such individual. These transactions allow the individual to continue to own the covered securities, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the individual may no longer have the same objectives as the Company s other shareholders. Accordingly, persons subject to this Policy are prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions involving Company securities. 
 
 4 

6. Prohibition on Tipping . Communication of inside information to another person who may trade or advise others to trade on the basis of the information is considered tipping. Tipping is illegal and could subject both the tipper and the tippee to severe civil and criminal penalties, as well as termination of employment by the Company. 
 
 7. Exceptions . These trading restrictions do not apply to 
 
 (a) Stock Option Exercises and Restricted Stock Awards . Exercises of stock options or other equity awards or the surrender or withholding of shares to the Company in payment of the exercise price or in satisfaction of any tax withholding obligations, in each case in a manner permitted by the applicable equity award agreement provided, however, that the securities so acquired may not be sold (either outright or in connection with a cashless exercise transaction through a broker) other than to the Company as provided in clause (d) of this Section 5 while the associate or Director is aware of material, non-public information or, if the associate or Director is a Designated Person, while the trading window is closed 
 
 (b) 401(k) Plan or DSPP . Acquisitions or dispositions of Company stock under the Company s 401(k) plan, the Company s Discounted Stock Purchase Plan DSPP or other individual account plan which, subject to clause (c), are made pursuant to standing instructions not entered into or modified while the associate or Director is aware of material, non-public information or, if the associate or Director is a Designated Person, while the trading window is closed. This exception does not apply, however, to certain elections you may make under the 401(k) plan or DSPP, including, as applicable (i) an election to increase or decrease the percentage of your elective deferrals that will be allocated to the Company stock fund (ii) an election to initiate, increase or decrease contributions with respect to the DSPP (iii) an election to make an intra-plan transfer of an existing account balance into or out of the Company stock fund (iv) an election to borrow money against your 401(k) plan account if the loan will result in a liquidation of some or all of your Company stock fund balance and (v) an election to pre-pay a plan loan if the pre-payment will result in allocation of loan proceeds to the Company stock fund 
 
 (c) Other Purchases from or Sales to the Company. Other purchases of securities from the Company or sales of securities to the Company and 
 
 (d) Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans . Purchases or sales made pursuant to a binding contract, written plan or specific instruction (as discussed in more detail below, a trading plan which is adopted and operated in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and this Policy. This exception applies only to Section 1. Trading in Company Securities . All restrictions set forth in Sections 2 through 6 above shall apply. 
 
 Determination of Materiality 
 
 Determining what information about the Company or any other company is material may be difficult. If there is any doubt or the question is close, then the answer should be not to trade while aware of such information. If an associate has a question, he or she should raise it with the Chief Financial Officer or the General Counsel. 
 
 5 

Penalties 
 
 Persons who trade in a company s securities while aware of inside information are subject to severe sanctions, including (i) termination or suspension of employment by the Company, (ii) ineligibility for future participation in the Company s equity incentive programs, (iii) compensation freezing, (iv) disgorgement of gains or avoided losses from transactions that violate this Policy, (v) reimbursement of the Company s costs in responding to a violation of this Policy, as well as (vi) civil and criminal penalties, which could include monetary fines, liability for damages and prison time. 
 
 Additional Restrictions and Procedures for Designated Persons 
 
 1. Designated Persons . Designated Persons are persons that are otherwise covered by this Policy as set forth in Coverage above but who also come within one of the following four categories (a) all Directors and executive officers of the Company (the Section 16 Insiders (b) any associate of the Company who is specifically notified that he or she is a Designated Person (c) Family Members of Section 16 Insiders or Family Members of specifically notified associates as specified in clause (b) and (d) all corporations, partnerships, trusts or other entities controlled by any of the above persons. 
 
 2. Pre-clearance of Trades . To help prevent inadvertent violations of this Policy and to avoid even the appearance of improper transactions, the Company has implemented the following procedures for pre-clearance of all trades (including gifts) in the securities of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company by Designated Persons. 
 
 A Designated Person wishing to trade in Company securities must first notify the General Counsel s office when they or any Family Member plans to enter into a transaction in the securities of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. This notification must be in writing (including by e-mail) and should include the identity of the Designated Person, the type of transaction (for example, an open market purchase, a privately negotiated sale, an option exercise, a gift, etc.), the date or proposed date of the transaction and the number of options or shares involved. In addition, the Designated Person must execute a certification (in the form attached as Exhibit A) that he or she is not aware of material, non-public information about the Company. The Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel shall have sole discretion to decide whether to permit the contemplated transaction. (The General Counsel shall have sole discretion to decide whether to permit transactions by the Chief Financial Officer or his or her Family Members, and the Chief Financial Officer shall have sole discretion to decide whether to permit transactions by the General Counsel or his or her Family Members.) All trades that are pre-cleared must be effected within five business days of receipt of the pre-clearance unless a specific exception has been granted by the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer. A pre-cleared trade (or any portion of a pre-cleared trade) that has not been effected during the five business day period must be pre-cleared again prior to execution. If a Designated Person becomes aware of material, non-public information following receipt of pre-clearance but before the trade is executed, the Designated Person must not complete the trade. 
 
 3. Trading Window . As a general rule, transactions by Designated Persons in the securities of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company will be permitted only when the trading window is open. The open window period typically begins one full trading day following the public announcement by the Company of its quarterly earnings. The open window period typically ends on the day that is two 
 6 

calendar weeks prior to the end of each fiscal quarter, except for the third fiscal quarter, where the open window period will end after two weeks. The Company may from time to time close the trading window when it would otherwise be open in view of significant events or developments involving the Company. As a convenience, Designated Persons will be sent notices pertaining to the opening and closing of the trading window. 
 
 4. Pre-clearance of 10b5-1 Trading Plans . Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense against an allegation of insider trading. In order to be eligible to rely on this defense, a Designated Person must enter into a Rule 10b5-1 plan for transactions in securities of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company that satisfies certain requirements specified in the Rule (including cooling-off periods). If the plan meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1, a Designated Person may purchase or sell securities of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company pursuant to the plan without regard to certain insider trading restrictions. In general, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be entered into at a time when the person entering into the plan is not aware of material nonpublic information. Once the Rule 10b5-1 Plan is adopted, the person must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of the trade . For example, if a Designated Person implements a written trading plan (at a time when he or she was not aware of material, non-public information) specifying that he or she will sell 1,000 shares of common stock of the Company on the first day of each month following the end of the applicable cooling-off period, a sale pursuant to that plan would not subject the Designated Person to insider trading liability even if he or she was aware of material, non-public information at the time the sale took place. 
 
 Trading plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 have the obvious advantage of protecting against insider trading liability. However, they also require advance commitments regarding the amounts, prices and timing of purchases and sales under those plans and contracts, and thus limit flexibility and discretion with respect to such transactions to some degree. Accordingly, while some Designated Persons may find such trading plans attractive, they may not be suitable for all Designated Persons. It is the Company s policy that any Designated Person wishing to adopt a new Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or amend an existing Rule 10b5-1 trading plan submit the trading plan in advance for review and written approval by the General Counsel and or the Chief Financial Officer. 
 
 The General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer will approve a trading plan or trading plan amendment only if the trading plan (1) is in writing (2) is submitted to the Company for review by the General Counsel and or Chief Financial Officer prior to its adoption and (3) is to be adopted while the Designated Person is not aware of material, non-public information and when the trading window is open. 
 
 While the Company encourages Designated Persons to use trading plans as appropriate, the Company s expectation is that the Designated Person will adhere to the terms of the trading plan and not seek to terminate the trading plan before its natural conclusion. While the Company will not permit amendments to a trading plan, it will consider requests for early termination of a trading plan on a case-by-case basis. The Company expects that a Designated Person who successfully terminates a trading plan early will not seek to enter into a new trading plan for a period of at least six months following the early termination of that trading plan. Further, if the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that a Designated Person has engaged in a pattern of early termination of trading plans, the Company may decline to pre-approve future requests for trading plans by the Designated Person.

5. Post Transaction Notification . Section 16 Insiders must notify the General Counsel promptly following, and in no event more than one business day after, any trades (including gifts) in the securities of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company to facilitate compliance with the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and the rules promulgated thereunder). 
 
 All questions about this policy should be directed to the Office of the General Counsel or Office of the Chief Financial Officer.

Exhibit A 
 
 PRE-CLEARANCE CERTIFICATION 
 
 I certify that I have read and I am familiar with the Insider Trading Policy of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company & Subsidiaries (the Company ). 
 
 Based on my review of the Company s Insider Trading Policy, I believe the proposed purchase or sale of securities of the Company, or adoption of a Rule 10b5-1 plan regarding a future purchase or sale of securities of the Company, for which I am seeking pre-clearance is being completed in accordance with the Company s Insider Trading Policy. 
 
 Further, by signing this certification, I represent to the Company that to the best of my knowledge I am not currently aware of any material, non-public or inside information about the Company. 
 
 I agree that if I become aware of any material, non-public or inside information about the Company at any time after pre-clearance has been granted but before the purchase, sale or adoption of a 10b5-1 plan, or if I am not sure whether such information is material, I will immediately stop the execution of such purchase or sale or adoption of a 10b5-1 plan and contact the General Counsel or Chief Financial Officer of the Company. However, once the purchase or sale has taken place, or once the adoption of a 10b5-1 plan has become effective, I need not take any further action. 
 
 Finally, I understand that early termination of a 10b5-1 plan exposes me to external regulatory risks as well as internal Company actions intended to discourage such activity.

Exhibit 97 
 THE SCOTTS MIRACLE-GRO COMPANY & SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 EXECUTIVE OFFICER CLAWBACK POLICY 
 
 GENERAL POLICY 
 
 Executive Officer Clawback Policy . Effective 10 02 2023 (the Effective Date ). This policy supersedes and replaces in its entirety the Executive Compensation Recovery Policy that was effective as of September 22, 2010. 
 1. ADMINISTRATION AND APPLICATION. This Executive Officer Clawback Policy (this Policy shall be administered and interpreted by the Compensation and Organization Committee (the Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (and together with its affiliates, the Company ). This Policy provides for the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation from Executive Officers in the event of an Accounting Restatement. This Policy is intended to comply with, and shall be interpreted consistent with, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act Rule 10D-1 and Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange NYSE Listed Company Manual (the Listing Rule ). Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, capitalized terms used in this Policy have the meanings given to them in Section 2 
 
 SPECIFIC GUIDANCE 
 
 2. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms have the meanings set forth below. 
 A. Accounting Restatement means an accounting restatement of the Company s financial statements due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 
 B. Accounting Restatement Date means the earlier to occur of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement and (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 
 C. Clawback Period means, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the Accounting 
 
 1 

Restatement Date and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years. 
 D. Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
 E. Erroneously Awarded Compensation means, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by an Executive Officer during the Clawback Period that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received by such Executive Officer had the Incentive-Based Compensation been determined based on the restated amounts in such Accounting Restatement. The amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be computed without regard to any taxes paid by the relevant Executive Officer (including any taxes withheld by the Company from the Incentive-Based Compensation paid to such Executive Officer). For Incentive-Based Compensation based on (or derived from) stock price or total stockholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement (i) the Committee must determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation related to such Incentive-Based Compensation by making a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total stockholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received and (ii) the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to NYSE. 
 F. Executive Officer means each individual who is currently or was previously designated as an officer of the Company as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act. For the avoidance of doubt, the identification of an executive officer for purposes of this Policy shall include each executive officer who is or was identified pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K, as well as the principal financial officer and principal accounting officer (or, if there is no principal accounting officer, the controller). 
 G. Financial Reporting Measure means any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure. A Financial Reporting Measure is not required to be presented within the Company s financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC to qualify as a Financial Reporting Measure. For purposes of this Policy, Financial Reporting Measure includes, but is not limited to, stock price and total stockholder return. 
 H. Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. 
 2 

I. SEC means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 3. APPLICATION. This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation received by a person (a) after beginning service as an Executive Officer (b) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation (c) while the Company had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association and (d) during the Clawback Period. For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation is considered received in the Company s fiscal period during which the relevant Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms of this Policy apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation received by Executive Officers on or after the Effective Date even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded, granted or paid to Executive Officers before the Effective Date. 
 4. RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION. In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall reasonably promptly determine and recover the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by any Executive Officer, as determined pursuant to this Policy. The Committee shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, the timing and method for recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation, to the extent permitted under the Listing Rule and in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code, which may include without limitation (a) seeking reimbursement of all or part of any cash or equity-based award, (b) cancelling prior cash or equity-based awards, (c) canceling or offsetting against any future payable or planned compensation (including, without limitation, base salary or cash or equity-based awards), (d) forfeiture of deferred compensation and (e) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. 
 A. The Company s recovery obligation pursuant to this Section 4 shall not apply if any of the following conditions are met and the Committee determines that such recovery would be impracticable 
 i. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to NYSE 
 ii. Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company must obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to NYSE, that 
 3 

recovery would result in such a violation, and provide a copy of the opinion to NYSE or 
 iii. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the registrant, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Code and regulations thereunder. 
 5. MEANS OF COLLECTING RECOVERY. Recovery may be obtained, without limitation, by reducing future payments or by seeking repayment or return of prior awards to the Executive Officer. All actions by the Company to recover Incentive Based Compensation shall be taken in accordance with applicable law. Any right of recovery or recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company under applicable law, rule or regulation or pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, award agreement or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. Nothing contained in this Policy, and no recovery or recoupment as contemplated by this Policy, shall limit any claims, damages or other legal remedies the Company may have against an Executive Officer arising out of or resulting from any actions or omissions by the Executive Officer. 
 6. INDEMNIFICATION PROHIBITION. The Company is prohibited from (a) indemnifying any Executive Officer against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation and (b) paying, or reimbursing any Executive Officer for, the cost of any insurance to cover any such loss. 
 7. NOTICE. The Company shall take all appropriate steps to inform its Executive Officers of this Policy so that it is enforceable to the fullest extent legally permissible. These steps may include, without limitation, incorporating the terms of this Policy into the terms of any incentive plan or incentive award agreement applicable to Executive Officers and requiring an Executive Officer to acknowledge and agree that any employment agreement, award agreement or other agreement entered into or provided to such Executive Officer shall be subject to the terms of this Policy provided, however, that the Company s failure to do so shall not serve as a waiver of the Company s rights or such Executive Officer s obligations under this Policy with respect to any such employment agreement, award agreement or other agreement. In addition, the Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including disclosures required by applicable SEC filings. 
 8. COORDINATION WITH LAW. The Committee is authorized to make all determinations under this Policy to the extent permitted by the Listing Rule and in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. In the event that any provision of this Policy is inconsistent with applicable laws, rules or regulations, including SEC rules or the rules of any national securities exchange or a national securities association on which the Company s securities are listed, the Committee shall administer this Policy to comply with such laws, rules or regulations. All determinations made by the Committee pursuant 
 4 

to this Policy will be final and binding on all persons, including the Company and its shareholders and Executive Officers, and need not be uniform with respect to each individual subject to the Policy. 
 9. AMENDMENT TERMINATION. The Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, including SEC rules or the rules of any national securities exchange or a national securities association on which the Company s securities are listed. The Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall adversely affect in any material way any Incentive-Based Compensation approved, granted, awarded, earned or paid to an Executive Officer prior to the effective date of such amendment or termination, except solely to the extent such amendment or termination is required by applicable laws, rules or regulations, including SEC rules or the rules of any national securities exchange or a national securities association on which the Company s securities are listed. 
 10. SUCCESSORS. This Policy is binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.
