ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS 

GENERAL 
 
 Hennessy Advisors, Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our is a publicly traded investment management firm whose primary business activity is providing investment advisory services to a family of 16 open-end mutual funds (collectively, the Hennessy Mutual Funds and one exchange traded fund ETF branded as the Hennessy Funds. We are committed to providing superior service to investors and employing a consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy and hold philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. Our goal is to provide products that investors can have confidence in, knowing their money is invested as promised and with their best interests in mind. Our firm was founded on these principles 35 years ago, and the same principles guide us today. 
 
 We earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds and secondarily by providing shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds. Investment advisory services include managing the composition of each fund s portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with each fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), monitoring each fund s compliance with its investment objectives and restrictions and federal securities laws, monitoring the liquidity of each fund, reviewing each fund s investment performance, overseeing the selection and continued employment of sub-advisors and monitoring such sub-advisors adherence to the fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions, overseeing other service providers, maintaining in house marketing and distribution departments, preparing and distributing regulatory reports, and overseeing distribution of the funds through third party financial institutions. Shareholder services include maintaining a toll free number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about their accounts or the funds and actively participating as a liaison between investors in the Hennessy Funds and U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, the Hennessy Funds administrator. The fees we receive for investment advisory and shareholder services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. Accordingly, our total revenue increases or decreases as our average assets under management rises or falls. The percentage amount of the investment advisory fees varies from fund to fund, but the percentage amount of the shareholder service fees is consistent across all Hennessy Mutual Funds. 
 
 We have delegated the day to day portfolio management responsibilities to sub advisors, subject to our oversight, for some of the Hennessy Funds. In exchange for these sub advisory services, we pay each sub advisor a fee out of our own assets, which is calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub advised funds. Accordingly, the sub advisory fees we pay increase or decrease as our average assets under management in our sub advised funds increases or decreases, respectively. 
 
 Our average assets under management for fiscal year 2024 was 3.7 billion, and our total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2024 was 4.6 billion. Our business strategy centers on (i) organic growth through our marketing, sales, and distribution efforts and (ii) growth through strategic purchases of management related assets.

Multi-Asset Funds 
 
 Three of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Multi-Asset products. Of those three funds, two utilize a quantitative investment strategy and one is actively managed. These funds follow a more conservative investment strategy focused on generating income and providing an alternative to funds containing only equity stocks. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Multi Asset product category: 

Hennessy Total Return Fund (Investor Class symbol HDOGX). The Hennessy Total Return Fund seeks total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, by investing approximately 50 of its assets in the 10 highest dividend-yielding common stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (known as the Dogs of the Dow in roughly equal dollar amounts and the remaining 50 of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of less than one year. This fund then utilizes a borrowing strategy that allows the fund s performance to approximate what it would be if the fund had an asset allocation of roughly 75 Dogs of the Dow stocks and 25 U.S. Treasury securities. 

Hennessy Equity and Income Fund (Investor Class symbol HEIFX; Institutional Class symbol HEIIX). The Hennessy Equity and Income Fund seeks income and long-term capital appreciation with reduced volatility of returns by investing up to 70 of its assets in common stock, preferred stock, and equity like instruments and its remaining assets in asset backed and mortgage backed securities and debt instruments, including high yield bonds. 

Hennessy Balanced Fund (Investor Class symbol HBFBX). The Hennessy Balanced Fund seeks a combination of capital appreciation and current income by investing approximately 50 of its assets in roughly equal dollar amounts in the Dogs of the Dow stocks but limits exposure to market risk and volatility by investing approximately 50 of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of less than one year. 

Sector and Specialty Funds 
 
 Nine of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Sector and Specialty products. Of those nine funds, one is designed as an index fund and the other eight are actively managed, and each focuses on a niche sector of the stock market. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Sector and Specialty product category: 

Hennessy Energy Transition Fund (Investor Class symbol HNRGX; Institutional Class symbol HNRIX). The Hennessy Energy Transition Fund seeks total return by investing in companies operating in the United States across the full spectrum of the energy supply/demand value chain, including traditional upstream, midstream, and downstream energy companies, as well as renewable energy companies and energy end users.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, SOURCES OF REVENUES, AND 12B-1 PLANS 
 
 We earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds and secondarily by providing shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds. The fees we receive for these services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. In addition, the sub advisory fees that we pay are also calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub advised Hennessy Funds. The amount of our assets under management fluctuates as a result of organic inflows (purchases of shares of the Hennessy Funds by new or existing investors), acquisition inflows, outflows (redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds by investors), and market appreciation or depreciation.

The investment advisory agreements also provide that we are responsible for performing any ordinary clerical and bookkeeping services needed by the Hennessy Funds that are not provided by the funds custodian, administrator, or transfer agent. The Funds Board of Trustees comprises five trustees who are not interested persons of the Hennessy Funds (the disinterested trustees and Neil J. Hennessy, who is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ), a majority of the trustees must be disinterested trustees, and the disinterested trustees must approve entering into and continuing our investment advisory agreements. The disinterested trustees also have sole responsibility for selecting and nominating other disinterested trustees. 
 
 In exchange for the services described above, we receive an investment advisory fee from each Hennessy Fund that is calculated as a percentage of such fund s average daily net asset value. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, the percentages of each fund s assets used to calculate the annual investment advisory fees payable to us are as follows:

We waive a portion of our fees with respect to the Hennessy Midstream Fund, the Hennessy Technology Fund, and the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF to comply with contractual expense ratio limitations. The fee waivers are calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants at U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, reviewed by management, and then charged to expense monthly as offsets to our revenues. Each waived fee is then deducted from investment advisory fee income and reduces the aggregate amount of advisory fees we receive from such fund in the subsequent month. Total fee waivers during fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were 0.18 million and 0.15 million, respectively. To date, we have only waived fees based on contractual obligations, but we have the ability to waive fees at our discretion. Any decision to waive fees would apply only on a going forward basis.

Our investment advisory agreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) by (i) the Funds Board of Trustees or the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund and (ii) the vote of a majority of the disinterested trustees. If an investment advisory agreement is not renewed, it terminates automatically. There are two additional circumstances in which an investment advisory agreement terminates. First, an investment advisory agreement automatically terminates if we assign it to another advisor (assignment includes indirect assignment, which is the direct or indirect transfer of our common stock in sufficient quantities deemed to constitute a controlling block). Second, an investment advisory agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration upon 60 days written notice by either the applicable Hennessy Fund or us.

Assignment is generally defined under the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act to include direct assignments as well as assignments that are deemed to occur due to the change in control of the investment advisor, which includes us or one of the sub advisors that we have engaged on behalf of certain of the Hennessy Funds. However, a transaction is not an assignment under the 1940 Act or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act if it does not result in a change of actual control or management of us or, in the context of a sub-advisor, a change of actual control or management of the sub-advisor.

If a sub advisor experienced a change of control but we did not, we could continue acting as an advisor to the applicable Hennessy Fund, but the shareholders of such Hennessy Fund would have to approve a new sub advisory agreement for the sub advisor. Because obtaining shareholder approval for a new sub advisor can be costly both in terms of expense and time, we sought and received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC in 2023 to operate under a manager of managers structure. The manager of managers structure permits us to appoint and replace unaffiliated sub-advisors and to enter into and make material amendments to the related sub-advisory agreements on behalf of the Hennessy Funds without shareholder approval, but subject in each case to the approval of the Hennessy Funds Board of Trustees. Under the manager of managers structure, we have ultimate responsibility, subject to oversight by the Hennessy Funds Board of Trustees, for overseeing the Hennessy Funds unaffiliated sub-advisors and recommending their hiring, termination, or replacement. Even with the exemptive order from the SEC, we cannot implement the manager of managers structure on behalf of a particular Hennessy Fund until the shareholders of such Hennessy Fund approve its implementation. 
 
 We obtained shareholder approval for the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF in 2023 to operate under a manager of managers structure and are evaluating the timing and process for obtaining shareholder approval for the Hennessy Mutual Funds that have a sub advisor. With respect to the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF, our sub advisory agreement with VIA, one of the sub advisors for the fund, terminated automatically on July 14, 2023, in connection with an acquisition transaction that resulted in a change of control of VIA. As a result of the transaction, VIA ceased to exist and Vident Advisory became the sole Vident enterprise carrying out Vident s business and operations. On the same date, we entered into a new sub advisory agreement with Vident Advisory pursuant to which Vident Advisory now provides sub advisory services to the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. The new sub advisory agreement was approved by the Hennessy Funds Board of Trustees and by vote of the shareholders of the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. At the same meeting, the shareholders of the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF also approved the implementation of the manager of managers structure for the fund. 
 
 Shareholder Servicing Agreements and Fees 
 
 Pursuant to a shareholder servicing agreement with Hennessy Funds Trust, we provide shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds including, among other things, maintaining a toll free number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about their accounts or the funds and actively participating as a liaison between investors in the Hennessy Funds and U.S. Bank Global Fund Services. In exchange for these services, we receive a shareholder service fee from each Hennessy Mutual Fund of 0.10 of the average daily net assets of such fund s Investor Class shares. 
 
 The shareholder servicing agreement must be renewed annually by the Funds Board of Trustees, including the vote of a majority of the disinterested trustees. If the shareholder servicing agreement is not renewed, it terminates automatically. In addition, the shareholder servicing agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration upon 60 days written notice by Hennessy Funds Trust or us. 
 
 12b-1 Plans 
 
 All of the Hennessy Mutual Funds have adopted a 12b-1 plan. These plans are named after Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act, which permits a fund to adopt a plan that allows the fund to collect fees to use to make payments to third parties in connection with the distribution of fund shares. Amounts paid under a plan may be spent on any activities or expenses primarily intended to result in sale of shares of the fund, including, but not limited to (i) advertising, (ii) compensation paid to financial institutions, broker-dealers, and others for sales and marketing, (iii) shareholder accounting servicing, (iv) printing and mailing prospectuses to possible new investors, and (v) printing and mailing sales literature. A fund may also employ a distributor to distribute and market fund shares and then use 12b-1 fees to pay the distributor for expenses relating to telephone use, overhead, employing employees who engage in or support the distribution of the fund shares, printing prospectuses and other reports for possible new investors, advertising, and preparing and distributing sales literature. 
 
 The 12b 1 fee for each Hennessy Mutual Fund is 0.15 of the average daily net assets of such fund s Investor Class shares. 
 
 CUSTODIAL, DISTRIBUTION, AND BROKERAGE ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 We use independent third parties for custody and distribution of our assets under management.

Table of Contents 

All trades for the Hennessy Funds are executed by independent brokerage firms following our direction or the direction of our sub advisors. When selecting brokers, we and our sub advisors are required to seek best execution. Although there is no single statutory definition, SEC releases and other legal guidelines make clear that this duty requires us to seek the most advantageous terms reasonably available under the circumstances for a customer s account. The lowest possible commission, while important, is not the sole determinative factor. We and our sub advisors also consider factors such as order size and market depth, availability of competing markets and liquidity, trading characteristics of the security, financial responsibility of the broker dealer, and the broker s ability to address current market conditions. 
 
 Currently, we participate in soft dollar arrangements with one of our brokers. This means we receive research reports and real-time electronic research to assist us in trading and managing the Hennessy Funds. Under these soft dollar arrangements, the Hennessy Funds pay brokerage commissions for securities trades at the regular market rate, and some or all of the value of those commissions is received by us in the form of research or other services that benefit the Hennessy Funds. We believe our soft dollar arrangements comply with SEC guidance regarding soft dollars. 
 
 LICENSE AGREEMENT 
 
 Our ability to use the names and formulaic investment strategies of the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund and the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund are governed by the terms and conditions of a license agreement, dated as of April 10, 2000, with Netfolio. Under the license agreement, Netfolio granted us a perpetual, paid-up, royalty free, exclusive license to use certain trademarks, such as Strategy Indexing, Cornerstone Growth, and Cornerstone Value, as well as the formula investment strategies used by the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund and the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund. All of our advertising, marketing, promotional, and other materials incorporating or referring to the trademarks are subject to the prior written approval of Netfolio, except that we do not need Netfolio s prior written approval to use the trademarks in a manner that is not substantially unchanged from any prior use by Netfolio in its own business or from any prior use by us previously approved by Netfolio. We have the right to assign the license to another person or entity if the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the license agreement. There are no ongoing licensing fees associated with this license agreement, and Netfolio does not have any contractual rights to terminate the license agreement. 
 
 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 
 From the time we launched our first mutual fund in 1996, we have consistently pursued a growth strategy centered on organic growth through our marketing, sales, and distribution efforts and growth through strategic purchases of management related assets. The implementation of this business strategy is described below. 

Seeking to deliver strong investment performance of the Hennessy Funds 

One of the most effective ways we can grow the assets of the Hennessy Funds is by delivering strong investment performance, which we believe should: 

result in an increase in the value of existing assets of the Hennessy Funds; 

encourage more investors to buy shares of the Hennessy Funds and decrease the number of investors who redeem their shares and leave the Hennessy Funds; and 

motivate current investors to invest additional money in the Hennessy Funds. 

Utilizing our branding and marketing campaign to attract assets 

We believe we can attract investors to the Hennessy Funds by effectively marketing our consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy and hold philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. We offer quantitative funds, actively managed funds, and income-generating funds. We believe our quantitative funds attract investors who want to understand exactly how their investments are managed and who favor statistical analysis and empirical evidence as the basis for investment decisions. We also believe that our actively managed funds attract investors who appreciate a fundamental, hands-on investment management approach and talented portfolio managers. Finally, we believe our more conservative, income generating funds attract investors seeking alternatives to funds invested entirely in equities.

Table of Contents 

We run a comprehensive and far-reaching public relations program designed to disseminate our message to a wide variety of potential investors through frequent television appearances, radio spots, feature articles, and print media mentions. We have partnered with an industry-leading public relations firm, SunStar Strategic, to proactively promote the Hennessy Funds to national financial media. This public relations program has consistently resulted in the Hennessy Funds being mentioned an average of once every two to three days in national print and broadcast media such as CNBC, Fox News, Bloomberg radio and TV, The Wall Street Journal, Kiplinger, and Barron s, among others. To facilitate our presence in the media, we utilize LiveStudio, an in-house studio providing a direct link to media broadcasts, at our office in Novato, California. We have several spokespeople who help us expand our public relations program and provide comprehensive media coverage of our products, including (i) Neil J. Hennessy, who is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors as well as President, Chief Market Strategist, and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds, (ii) Ryan Kelley, Chief Investment Officer and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds, and (iii) Portfolio Managers Ben Cook, David Ellison, and Josh Wein, as well as the Portfolio Managers at our sub advisors. 
 
 We maintain and regularly update a robust website and social media presence. Our core marketing efforts include targeted outreach to both current and prospective investors in the Hennessy Funds, including financial advisors and retail investors. Our content marketing includes overall market and sector specific thought leadership, promotional investment ideas, fund updates, and commentary from our portfolio managers, as well as feature news articles and broadcast appearances. We attend select investment advisor trade shows and strategic industry related conferences, and we seek opportunities to moderate or speak on industry-related panels. 

Expanding our distribution network to additional distribution platforms 

Investors may purchase shares of the Hennessy Funds through financial institutions, including fund supermarkets, national wirehouses and broker dealers, independent and regional broker-dealers, and registered investment advisors. 
 
 Fund supermarkets, such as Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and Pershing, generally offer funds of many different investment companies to investors in exchange for a services fee paid by the applicable fund or that fund s investment advisor. The ability to purchase various funds in a single location is very attractive to investors, and the majority of our assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2024 was held at fund supermarkets. Additionally, we continually seek opportunities to form new relationships with financial institutions to make the Hennessy Funds even more accessible to investors. We oversee distribution of the Hennessy Funds through all financial institutions. 
 
 Investors may also purchase shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds directly through the Hennessy Funds' website or by calling us or U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, the Hennessy Funds administrator. 

Increasing our current base of financial advisors and investment professionals 

Investment professionals generally have access to a wide variety of investment products they may recommend to their clients. A recommendation by an investment professional to a client to buy one of the Hennessy Funds may greatly influence that investor. Thus, we believe that expanding our current base of investment professionals who utilize no-load funds for their clients will help us increase our assets under management, which will in turn increase our revenues. 

Securing participation on the platforms of national full-service firms 

We continually strive to develop relationships with national full-service firms that permit their investment professionals to offer no-load funds to their clients as a way to increase the amount of assets that we manage, which will in turn increase our revenues.

Pursuing strategic purchases of management agreements for additional funds 

A primary component of our growth strategy is to selectively pursue strategic purchases of the assets related to the management of additional funds. We believe the regulatory burden imposed upon the fund industry, along with increased competition, has compressed the margins of smaller to mid-sized fund managers, making those managers more receptive to an asset purchase. The long term trend toward lower fees has made it more challenging to identify accretive asset purchases, but we believe that we are well positioned to move quickly once we identify any attractive purchase targets from the large supply of potential targets. 
 
 Through our asset purchase strategy, we have completed 12 purchases of the assets related to the management of investment funds over a nearly 25 year period, integrating 4.4 billion in net assets of 33 different investment funds into the Hennessy Funds family. 

Delivering strong, high quality financial results. 

We seek to maintain a strong financial position and to manage our investment advisory business to meet the highest regulatory, ethical, and business standards and to maintain continuity of service to all of the investors in the Hennessy Funds. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 
 The investment advisory industry is highly competitive, with new competitors continually entering the industry. We compete directly with numerous global and U.S. investment managers, commercial banks, savings and loans associations, brokerage and investment banking firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial services complexes. We are considered a small investment advisory company. Many competing companies are part of larger financial services companies that conduct business in more markets and have greater marketing, financial, technical, research, and distribution resources and other capabilities than we do. Most of the larger firms offer a broader range of financial services to the same retail and institutional investors we seek to serve. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and we can give no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain and enhance our current investor relationships, as well as to create new ones, will be successful. To grow our business, we must be able to compete effectively for assets under management. Key competitive factors include: 

the investment performance of the Hennessy Funds; 

the breadth of our product offerings; 

industry rankings of the Hennessy Funds; 

the quality of our services; 

our ability to further develop and market our brand; 

our commitment to placing the interests of investors first; and 

our general business reputation. 

Increased competition could reduce the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Competition is an important risk that our business faces and should be considered along with other risk factors that we discuss in Item 1A, Risk Factors.

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 
 We are subject to an increasing number of extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations intended to protect investors in funds and investors of registered investment advisors. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 We are registered as an investment advisor with the SEC and, therefore, must comply with the requirements of the Advisers Act and related SEC regulations. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to investors, transactions with investors, compliance program effectiveness, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, recordkeeping and reporting, disclosure, and anti-fraud matters. 
 
 We manage accounts for the Hennessy Funds on a discretionary basis, meaning that we have the authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker dealers to execute trades, and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with certain of these transactions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker-dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. All of our soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of statutory amendments or new regulations, our operating expenses would increase. 
 
 The Hennessy Funds are registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act, which imposes additional obligations on both the Hennessy Funds and us, as the advisor to the Hennessy Funds, including detailed operational requirements. While we exercise broad discretion over the day-to-day management of the business, affairs, and investment portfolios of the Hennessy Funds, our operations are subject to oversight and management by the Funds Board of Trustees. The responsibilities of the Funds Board of Trustees include, among other things, annually approving the continuation of our investment advisory agreements and shareholder servicing agreement with the Hennessy Funds and our sub-advisory agreements with the sub advisors to the Hennessy Funds, approving other service providers, determining the method of valuing assets, and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. The 1940 Act also imposes on us a fiduciary duty with respect to receiving investment advisory fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC, by administrative action, or through litigation initiated by investors in the Hennessy Funds pursuant to a private right of action. 
 
 The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act of 1940 and the 1940 Act, ranging from fines and censures to the suspension of individual employees to termination of our registration as an investment advisor. A violation of applicable law or regulations could also subject us, our directors, and our employees to civil actions brought by private parties. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable SEC requirements. 
 
 EMPLOYEES 
 
 As of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had 18 employees, 17 of whom were full-time employees. Our 18 employees had an average tenure of 14 years as of the end of fiscal year 2024. We focus on providing our employees competitive compensation, a friendly and flexible office environment, and fostering close-knit working relationships among our team members. Over 50 of our employees are women, and with an executive team that is 50 women and 25 minority, we believe we have created an environment in which all team members can be successful and supported. 
 
 Our executive officers are (i) Neil J. Hennessy, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, (ii) Teresa M. Nilsen, President, Chief Operating Officer, Secretary, and a member of our Board of Directors, (iii) Kathryn R. Fahy, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, and (iv) Daniel B. Steadman, Executive Vice President. In addition to our executive officers responsibilities at Hennessy Advisors, Inc., (a) Mr. Hennessy is President, Chief Market Strategist, and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds and is a member of the Funds Board of Trustees, (b) Ms. Nilsen is an Executive Vice President and Treasurer of the Hennessy Funds, (c) Ms. Fahy is Senior Vice President, Assistant Treasurer, and Assistant Secretary of the Hennessy Funds, and (d) Mr. Steadman is an Executive Vice President and Secretary of the Hennessy Funds.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION 
 
 We make available free of charge through a link on our website, www.hennessyadvisors.com, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. We are not including the information contained on our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

We face many risks and uncertainties, many of which are inherent in the financial services industry and the investment advisory business. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, in evaluating us and our common stock. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks we face, including those described below. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT 
 
 Investors in the Hennessy Funds can redeem their investments at any time and for any reason, including poor investment performance and volatile equity markets. A decline in our assets under management adversely affects our revenues. 
 
 Investors in the Hennessy Funds may redeem their investments at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Success in the investment advisory and fund business is largely dependent on investment performance, as well as investor servicing and distribution. If the Hennessy Funds perform poorly compared to the investment products offered by other investment advisory firms, we may experience a decrease in purchases of shares and an increase in redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. Further, sharp declines in the stock market have and may continue to cause increases in redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. Such redemptions reduce our assets under management and adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 Adverse opinions of the Hennessy Funds by third parties, including rating agencies or industry analysts, could decrease new investments in, or accelerate redemptions from, the Hennessy Funds, which would adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 The Hennessy Funds are rated, ranked, and assessed by independent third parties, including rating agencies, industry analysts, distribution partners, and industry periodicals. These ratings, rankings, and assessments often influence the investment decisions of investors, but they can be affected by a number of factors that are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a ranking agency like Morningstar may change its ranking designs and methodology, which could result in a decrease in the ratings of the Hennessy Funds without any action on our part. If the Hennessy Funds received an adverse rating, ranking, or assessment from a third party, it could result in an increase in the withdrawal of assets from the Hennessy Funds by existing investors and the inability to attract additional investments into the Hennessy Funds from existing and new investors, thereby reducing our assets under management and adversely affecting our revenues. 
 
 Volatility in and disruption of the capital markets and changes in the economy has and may continue to significantly affect our assets under management and revenues. 
 
 The securities markets are inherently volatile and may be affected by factors beyond our control, including global economic conditions, industry trends, interest and inflation rate fluctuations, political factors, the imposition of economic sanctions, public health crises, natural disasters, and other factors that are difficult to predict. Because our assets under management is largely concentrated in equity products, our results are particularly susceptible to downturns in the equity markets. We derive all of our operating revenues from investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees paid to us by the Hennessy Funds. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset value of the Hennessy Funds. Accordingly, our revenues increase or decrease as our average assets under management increases or decreases, which is affected by market appreciation or depreciation and purchases and redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. Changing market conditions could also cause an impairment to the value of our management contract asset.

Table of Contents 

The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on the Hennessy Funds within such similar product type, irrespective of our fund performance. 
 
 Many competitors offer similar products to the Hennessy Funds, and the failure or negative performance of competitors products could lead to a loss of confidence in the corresponding products in the Hennessy Funds lineup, irrespective of the performance of the Hennessy Funds. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to redemptions in the Hennessy Fund within such product type, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Our business and operations are subject to adverse effects from market reactions to the outbreak of contagious diseases. 
 
 The outbreak and spread of contagious diseases may adversely impact global commercial activity, contribute to significant volatility in global equity and debt markets, and disrupt supply chains, operations, and economic activity. Such outbreaks may adversely impact the value and performance of the Hennessy Funds, which may result in declines in our revenues and limit our ability to source and pursue potential acquisitions. Future outbreaks of contagious diseases could have adverse impacts on our business and financial performance. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR INDUSTRY 
 
 Investor behavior is influenced by short-term investment performance. 
 
 Investor behavior may be based on many factors, including short-term investment performance. Poor short term performance of the Hennessy Funds, irrespective of longer term success, could potentially lead to a decrease in purchases of shares of the Hennessy Funds and an increase in redemptions, thereby reducing our assets under management and adversely affecting our revenues. 
 
 Assets invested through financial institutions can be quickly redeemed, which could reduce our revenues. 
 
 Financial institutions are attractive to investors because of the ease of accessibility to a variety of funds, but this may cause the investments to be more sensitive to fluctuations in performance, especially in the short term. If we were unable to retain the assets of the Hennessy Funds held through financial institutions, our assets under management would be reduced. As a result, our revenues could decline and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Table of Contents 

We face intense competition in attracting investors and retaining net assets in the Hennessy Funds. 
 
 The investment advisory industry is intensely competitive and new participants are continually entering the industry. We compete directly with numerous global and U.S. investment advisors, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, brokerage and investment banking firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial services complexes. We are considered a small investment advisory company. Many competing companies are part of larger financial services companies that conduct business in more markets and have greater marketing, financial, technical, research, and distribution resources and other capabilities than we do. Most of the larger firms offer a broader range of financial services to the same retail and institutional investors that we seek to serve. If we are unable to attract investors and retain net assets in the Hennessy Funds due to increased competition, our revenues could decline and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 For more information regarding competitive factors, see the Competition subheading in Item 1, Business. 
 
 We may be unable to develop or acquire new products and the development of new products may expose us to reputational harm, additional costs, or operational risk. 
 
 Our continued financial performance may depend on our ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving investor demands and develop, market, and manage new investment products. Conversely, the development and introduction of new products requires continued innovative effort on our part and may require significant time and resources, as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting investor and market preferences, the introduction of competing products, constraints on our ability to manage growth, and compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements. A growing number of new products also depend on data provided by third parties as analytical inputs and are subject to additional risks, including with respect to data quality, cost, availability, and provider relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or acquire new products that address the needs of investors on the timescale they require. Any failure to successfully develop or acquire new products, or effectively manage associated operational risks, could harm our reputation and expose us to additional costs, which may reduce our assets under management and adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 Market consolidation and industry trends could negatively impact our business. 
 
 In recent years, there have been several instances of industry consolidation in both the distribution and investment management areas. Further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future. The increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future. Additionally, the market environment has increasingly led some investors to favor lower fee, passive products. As a result, investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained, and may continue to gain, market share from active managers like us. 
 
 Industry trends and market pressure to lower our investment advisory fees could reduce our profit margin. 
 
 Our profits are highly dependent on the fees we are able to charge to the Hennessy Funds for investment advisory services. To the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of the investment advisory fees we charge to the Hennessy Funds, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structures. We have historically competed primarily on the performance of the Hennessy Funds and not on the level of our investment advisory fees relative to those of our competitors, but there has been downward pressure on fees in the investment advisory industry for many years. To maintain our fee structures in a competitive environment, we must be able to provide investors in the Hennessy Funds with investment returns and service that will adequately compensate them for investing in our funds with our current fee structures. We may not succeed in maintaining our current fee structures, and fee reductions on existing or future business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Higher insurance premiums and increased insurance coverage risks could increase our costs and reduce our profitability. 
 
 We carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate, but we cannot guarantee that our insurance policies will cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or, if covered, that such liabilities and losses will not exceed insurance coverage limits or that our insurers will remain solvent and meet their obligations. In addition, insurance premiums and required retentions have increased in the past and may do so again in the future.

We are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. An adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties. Various claims may also arise against us in the ordinary course of business, such as employment-related claims. There has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance liabilities, or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 We are exposed to legal risk and litigation, which could increase our expenses and reduce our profitability. 
 
 We are subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability, including, by way of example, investors in the Hennessy Funds, our own shareholders, our employees, or regulators. Lawsuits or investigations that we may become involved in could be very expensive and highly damaging to our reputation, even if the underlying claims are without merit. 
 
 Our business is extensively regulated, which increases our costs of doing business, and our failure to comply with regulatory requirements may harm our financial condition. 
 
 Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States, particularly by the SEC. We are subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, and various other statutes. The laws to which we are subject are designed primarily to protect investors in the Hennessy Funds as opposed to our shareholders. In addition to an increased number of applicable laws, the investment fund industry has undergone increased scrutiny by the SEC and state regulators in recent years, resulting in numerous enforcement actions and sweep examinations. Increased regulation has increased our costs in managing the Hennessy Funds, and we could continue to experience higher costs if new laws require us to spend more time, hire additional personnel, or buy new technology to comply effectively. Any change in law could also have a material adverse effect on us by limiting the sources of our revenues and increasing our costs. In addition to securities regulations, our business also may be materially adversely affected by other types of laws and policies. 
 
 Any determination of a failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, or regulations could expose us or our employees to civil liability, criminal liability, or disciplinary or enforcement action, with penalties that could include the disgorgement of fees, fines, sanctions, suspensions, or censure of individual employees, or revocation or limitation of business activities or registration, and may result in monetary losses that are not covered by insurance in adequate amounts or at all, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, if we or our employees were to fail to comply with applicable laws, rules, or regulations, or be named as a subject of an investigation or other regulatory action, the public announcement and potential publicity surrounding any such investigation or action could have an adverse effect on our reputation and our stock price and result in increased costs, even if we or our employees were found not to have violated such laws, rules, or regulations. 
 
 Changes to U.S. or state tax laws, our failure to adequately comply with U.S. or state tax laws, or the outcome of any audits or regulatory disputes with respect to our compliance with U.S. or state tax laws could adversely affect us. 
 
 Changes to U.S. or state tax law could be enacted in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, we are subject to potential tax audits in various jurisdictions and in such event, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess penalties or additional taxes. While we assess regularly the likely outcomes of these potential audits, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of a potential audit, and an audit could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Our investment advisory agreements require us to adhere to the investment policies and strategies of the Hennessy Funds; any failure to comply with such requirements could result in claims, losses, or regulatory sanctions. 
 
 Our investment advisory agreements with the Hennessy Funds contain contractual provisions that require us to comply with the investment policies and strategies of the Hennessy Funds when we provide our investment advisory services. We are also required to comply with numerous investment, asset valuation, distribution, and tax requirements under applicable law and regulations. Any allegation of a failure to adhere to these requirements could result in investor claims, reputational damage, withdrawal of assets, and potential regulatory sanctions, any of which could negatively impact our revenues and earnings. We have implemented procedures and utilize the services of experienced administrators, accountants, and lawyers to assist in satisfying these requirements, but there can be no assurance that these precautions will protect us from potential liabilities.

We may need to raise additional capital to fund new business initiatives, and resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse impact on our business. 
 
 Our ability to meet our future cash needs is dependent upon our ability to generate cash. Although we have been successful in generating sufficient cash in the past, we may not be successful in the future. We may need to raise additional capital to fund new business initiatives or repay the 2026 Notes, and financing may not be available to us in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to access bank financing or capital markets efficiently depends on a number of factors, including the state of credit and equity markets, interest rates, and credit spreads. If we are unable to access sufficient capital on acceptable terms, our business could be adversely impacted. 
 
 Failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies, as well as circumvention of established controls and policies by employees, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors in the Hennessy Funds and by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm. 
 
 Our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining investors in the Hennessy Funds. In recent years, there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud, conflicts of interest, or other misconduct by individuals in the financial services industry. We have implemented controls and risk management policies to monitor and manage risks, but we cannot be certain that such controls and policies will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks. Further, although we strive to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and emphasize the importance of doing so to our employees, there is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage in, or be accused of engaging in, illegal or suspicious activity (such as improper trading, disclosure of confidential information, or breach of fiduciary duties), we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position, and ability to maintain and grow the number of investors in the Hennessy Funds. 
 
 The historical performance of the Hennessy Funds should not be considered indicative of the future results of the Hennessy Funds or of any returns expected on our common stock. 
 
 The historical performance of the Hennessy Funds is relevant to returns on our common stock only insofar as the fees we have earned in the past and may earn in the future, which are based on average assets under management, may impact the performance of our common stock. Positive performance of the Hennessy Funds typically increases our revenues, which in turn could positively affect our business, and poor performance typically reduces our revenues, which in turn could adversely affect our business. However, the historical and potential future returns of the Hennessy Funds are not directly linked to returns on our common stock, such that positive performance of the Hennessy Funds will not necessarily result in positive returns on our common stock and poor performance of the Hennessy Funds will not necessary result in negative returns on our common stock. Moreover, the historical performance of the Hennessy Funds should not be considered indicative of the future results that should be expected from such funds. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND OPERATIONS 
 
 We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of the Hennessy Funds. 
 
 For the past several years, approximately 75 of our assets under management has been concentrated in five or six of our funds. During fiscal year 2024, our average assets under management was concentrated in the following five funds: (i) the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (27 of average assets under management); (ii) the Hennessy Focus Fund (18 of average assets under management); (iii) the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (12 of average assets under management); (iv) the Hennessy Japan Fund (10 of average assets under management); and (v) the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund (9 of average assets under management). Consequently, our revenues followed a similar pattern of concentration: (a) the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (26 of total revenue); (b) the Hennessy Focus Fund (21 of total revenue); (c) the Hennessy Japan Fund (10 of total revenue); (d) the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund (9 of total revenue); and (e) the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund (8 of total revenue). As a result, our operating results are particularly dependent upon the performance of a small number of funds and our ability to maintain and grow assets under management in these funds. These funds have from time to time experienced significant redemptions and may do so again in the future. A significant increase in redemptions for any reason would reduce our assets under management and revenues. 
 
 We pursue strategic asset purchases as part of our regular business strategy, and such acquisitions involve inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition and potentially dilute the holdings of current shareholders. 
 
 As part of our regular business strategy, we pursue strategic purchases of the assets related to the management of additional funds. This strategy is accompanied by risks including, among others, the possibility of the following: 

the potential unavailability of attractive acquisition opportunities; 

a high level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources than we do; 

our inability to value potential asset purchases accurately and negotiate acceptable purchase terms; 

our inability to obtain quorum and secure enough affirmative votes to gain approval of the proposed fund reorganization from the target fund s investors; 

the loss of fund assets paid for in an asset purchase through redemptions by investors of the funds involved in the asset purchase; 

higher than anticipated asset purchase expenses; 

25

Table of Contents 

our inability to successfully integrate and maintain adequate infrastructure to support business growth; 

increasing our leverage; 

the potential diversion of our management s time and attention; 

dilution to our shareholders if we fund an asset purchase in whole or in part with our common stock; and 

adverse effects on our earnings if purchased intangible assets become impaired. 

Changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and hinder our growth. 
 
 Our primary source of distribution of the Hennessy Funds is through a variety of financial institutions. Our success is highly dependent on access to these various distribution channels. We cannot guarantee we will be able to retain access to these channels at similar pricing or at all. Increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income. These financial institutions generally can terminate their relationships with us on short notice. Mergers and other corporate transactions among distributors also may affect our relationships with financial institutions. Certain of the financial institutions upon whom we rely to distribute the Hennessy Funds also sell their own competing proprietary investment products, which could limit the distribution of our products. Investors increasingly rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager. These consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients choices, and they may favor one of our competitors as better meeting their particular clients needs. There is no assurance that the Hennessy Funds will be among their recommended choices in the future. 
 
 Additionally, particularly in the United States, certain financial institutions have substantially reduced the number of investment funds they make available to their clients. If a material portion of the financial institutions with whom we do business were to substantially narrow their product offerings, it could have a significant adverse effect on our assets under management, revenues, and net income. More broadly, in both retail and institutional channels, financial institutions (distribution firms and consultants) are seeking to reduce the number of investment management firms with which they do business. This poses risks of additional lost business if a particular financial institution chooses to stop or significantly reduce its business relationship with us. Any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these financial institutions and the consultant community due to any of the above-described factors would impair our ability to distribute the Hennessy Funds, which in turn would have a negative effect on our assets under management, revenues, and net income. 
 
 We depend on key personnel to manage our business, and the loss of any key person s services, combined with our inability to identify and retain a suitable replacement for such person, could materially adversely affect us. Additionally, the cost to retain our key personnel could put pressure on our operating margins. 
 
 Our success is largely dependent on the skills, experience, and performance of our key personnel. The business acumen, investment advisory expertise, and business relationships of our key personnel are critical elements in operating and expanding our business. Financial services professionals are in high demand, and we face significant competition for qualified employees. The loss of services of any of our key personnel for any reason, combined with our inability to identify and retain a suitable replacement for such person, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, in order to retain key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation to such individuals, resulting in additional expense. 
 
 We utilize a unitary fee structure for the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF, and we bear the risk that the Fund s operating expenses may increase and lead to a reduction in our revenues from the fund. 
 
 The Hennessy Stance ESG ETF pays us a unitary fee under its investment advisory agreement with us. Under a unitary fee structure, we bear all operating expenses incurred in connection with providing services to the fund. The operating expenses covered by the unitary fee include third party data providers, transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. Additionally, for no compensation, we pay all other operating expenses of the fund, including sub-advisory fees, with the exception of the following: (i) the management fees paid to us; (ii) distribution fees and expenses paid by the fund under any distribution plan adopted pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act; (iii) interest expenses; (iv) brokerage expenses, trading expenses, and other expenses (such as stamp taxes) in connection with the execution of portfolio transactions or in connection with creation or redemption transactions; (v) compensation paid to the independent trustees of the fund and fees paid to independent trustees counsel; (vi) tax expenses and governmental fees; and (vii) extraordinary expenses not incurred in the course of ordinary business (the Excluded Fees ). The fund and its shareholders bear the costs of Excluded Fees. The unitary fee structure generally eliminates the possibility for any decrease in the total fund expense ratio during periods when assets under management increase, which could lead to increased profitability for us if we are able to achieve economies of scale. On the other hand, if the fund s operating expenses increase (other than Excluded Fees), this will lead to a reduction in our profitability from the fund. 
 
 We utilize unaffiliated sub advisors to manage the portfolio composition of certain of the Hennessy Funds, and any matters that have an adverse impact on their businesses or any change in our relationships with our sub advisors could lead to a reduction in assets under management, which would adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 We utilize unaffiliated sub advisors to manage the portfolio composition of some of the Hennessy Funds. Although we perform due diligence on our sub advisors, we do not manage their day to day business activities. Our financial condition and profitability may be adversely affected by situations that are specific to such sub advisors, such as disruption of their operations, their exposure to disciplinary action, or reputational harm to them. 
 
 We periodically negotiate the terms and conditions of these sub advisory relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or our sub advisors. These relationships may also be terminated by us or the applicable sub advisor without penalty on 60 days notice. In addition, each sub advisory agreement must be renewed annually by the Funds Board of Trustees (or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund), including a majority of the disinterested trustees. Furthermore, a sub advisory agreement automatically terminates if it is assigned. Assignment is generally defined under the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act to include direct assignments as well as assignments that are deemed to occur due to the change in control of the investment advisor, which includes us or one of the sub advisors that we have engaged on behalf of certain of the Hennessy Funds. However, a transaction is not an assignment under the 1940 Act or the Advisers Act if it does not result in a change of actual control or management of us or, in the context of a sub-advisor, a change of actual control or management of the sub-advisor. 

26

Table of Contents 

Generally, if a sub advisor experiences a change of control but we do not, we could continue acting as an advisor to the applicable Hennessy Fund, but the shareholders of such Hennessy Fund would have to approve a new sub advisory agreement for the sub advisor. However, for the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF, we have the authority to appoint and replace unaffiliated sub advisors and to enter into and make material amendments to the related sub advisory agreements without shareholder approval. This is because we sought and received an exemptive order from the SEC in 2023 to operate under a manager of managers structure and subsequently obtained shareholder approval to implement such structure for the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. Under the manager of managers structure, we have ultimate responsibility, subject to oversight of and approval by the Hennessy Funds Board of Trustees, for overseeing the Hennessy Funds unaffiliated sub-advisors and recommending their hiring, termination, or replacement. We have not yet received, and do not have an estimated timeline for receiving, shareholder approval to operate under a manager of managers structure for the Hennessy Mutual Funds that are sub advised. 
 
 Any interruption or termination of our sub advisory relationships, whether due to a change of control or any other circumstance, could affect our ability to market our sub advised funds and result in a reduction in assets under management, which would adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 We depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks, could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities, costs, and reputational damage. 
 
 We use software and related technologies throughout our business and also utilize third-party vendors who use software and related technologies to provide services to us and the Hennessy Funds. We are dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cybersecurity policies, procedures, and capabilities we maintain to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them, including data provided by third parties that is significant to our business. An information security incident, such as a cyber-attack involving a phishing scam, business email compromise, malware, or ransomware attack, or an internally caused incident or disruption, such as misuse or a failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt our business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential investor or competitive information. Moreover, our growing reliance on mobile and cloud technology and any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption, or loss of personal, confidential, or proprietary information or third-party data. Additionally, although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our laptops and other mobile electronic hardware, if such hardware is stolen, misplaced, or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions. Furthermore, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available. 
 
 The financial services industry has been the subject of cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft, and destruction of corporate information or other assets as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by terrorist organizations and nation state actors. Although we have implemented policies and controls to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures will prove effective. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, to implement adequate preventative measures, or to address them until they are discovered. In addition, a successful cyber-attack may persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and it may take a considerable amount of time for an investigation to be completed and the severity and potential impact to be known. While such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, and communication to the public, regulators, shareholders, and investors in the Hennessy Funds may be inaccurate, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident.

If any of these events were to occur, we could suffer a financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to the Hennessy Funds and their investors, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We also may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. In addition, our cybersecurity insurance may not cover all losses and damages from such events and our ability to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future may be limited. 
 
 Finally, cybersecurity and data privacy are high priorities for many regulators, and many jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations in these areas. Enactment of privacy laws or regulations have, and may continue to, result in additional costs of compliance or litigation. In addition, while we strive to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, any failure to comply could result in regulatory investigations and penalties as well as negative publicity, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 We may be required to forego all or a portion of our fees under our investment advisory agreements with the Hennessy Funds. 
 
 On an annual basis, the Funds Board of Trustees must assess the reasonableness of our investment advisory fees. While the Funds Board of Trustees has found our investment advisory fees to be reasonable in the past, we cannot guarantee that it will continue to do so. Additionally, we regularly analyze the expense ratios of the Hennessy Funds and have the right to waive fees to compete with other funds with lower expense ratios (although in the past we have only waived fees based on contractual obligations). Any waiver of or reduction in fees would cause our revenues to decline and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any fee waiver would apply only on a going forward basis. 
 
 Our investment advisory and shareholder servicing agreements can be terminated on short notice, are not freely assignable, and must be renewed annually; the loss of such agreements would reduce our revenues. 
 
 We generate all of our operating revenues from the investment advisory and shareholder servicing agreements with the Hennessy Funds. These agreements may be terminated without penalty on 60 days notice and may not be assigned without the consent of investors in the Hennessy Funds. In addition, they each must be renewed annually by the Funds Board of Trustees (or, in the case of our investment advisory agreements, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund), including a majority of the disinterested trustees. The termination or non-renewal of these agreements, or the renegotiation of the terms of these agreements in a manner detrimental to us, could result in a substantial reduction in revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

The Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund invest in the Japanese stock market in yen, which involves foreign exchange and economic uncertainties. 
 
 The Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund are invested in securities listed on the Japanese stock market, which exposes these funds to risks that are not typically associated with an investment in a U.S. issuer. The values of these funds fluctuate with changes in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Investments in Japanese securities also expose these funds to the economic uncertainties affecting Japan, which may differ from those affecting the United States. Further, Japanese financial accounting standards and practices may differ, and there may be less information on Japanese companies available publicly. If these circumstances result in a reduction in the total assets of the Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund, our assets under management would be reduced, which would adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 We utilize quantitative investment strategies for some of the Hennessy Funds that require us to invest in specific portfolios of securities and hold these positions for a specified period of time regardless of performance. 
 
 Our formula driven funds adhere to quantitative investment strategies, and the portfolios of stocks held by such funds are rescreened and rebalanced at designated times in accordance with such investment strategies. Adhering to our investment strategies regardless of any adverse developments that may arise could result in substantial losses to the formula driven Hennessy Funds if, for example, the stocks selected for a fund are experiencing financial difficulty or are out of favor with investors in a given period. This could, in theory, result in relatively low performance of the formula driven Hennessy Funds and adversely affect the net assets of such Hennessy Funds. A decrease in the net assets of the Hennessy Funds would adversely affect our revenues. 
 
 Management contracts purchased by us are currently classified as an indefinite life asset subject to impairment analysis. The impairment analysis is based on subjective criteria, and an impairment loss could be recorded. 
 
 The management contracts we have purchased, an 82.3 million asset on the balance sheet as of the end of fiscal year 2024, are considered an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Management reviews the indefinite life classification of our management contract asset each reporting period. If the management contract asset is ever reclassified as an asset with a definite life, we would begin amortizing the management contracts over their remaining useful life. If the management contract asset continues to be classified as an indefinite life asset, we will continue to periodically review the carrying value to determine if any impairment has occurred. The impairment analysis is based on anticipated future cash flows, which are calculated based on assets under management. Although the management contract asset is not currently impaired, there is always a possibility of impairment in the future, which could require us to write off all or a portion of the asset. A write-off, depending on the amount, could have operational risks and could have a significant impact on the value of our equity and our earnings per share. 
 
 We have debt and may incur additional debt, which may increase the risk of investing in us and may harm our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and therefore increase the risks associated with investing in our securities.

On October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of the 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875 per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of our future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of our future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all future indebtedness and other obligations of any future subsidiaries of ours. 
 
 We may incur additional debt in the future. Our indebtedness could (i) decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes, (ii) limit our flexibility to make acquisitions, (iii) increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest, (iv) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry, and (v) increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions and financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. 
 While we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, due diligence and indemnification provisions, these or other risk-mitigating measures that we put in place may not be sufficient to address these risks. If one or more of these risks occur, we may be unable to successfully complete a purchase of management related assets (thereby requiring us to write off any related expenses), we may experience an impairment of our management contract asset, we may receive negative publicity or suffer other negative impacts on our reputation, and we may not achieve the expected return on investment. Any of these results could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK 
 
 Ownership of a large percentage of our common stock is concentrated with a small number of shareholders, which could increase the volatility in our stock trading and significantly affect our share price and causes us to experience limited trading volume in our securities. 
 
 We have a limited number of shareholders, and a large percentage of our common stock is held by an even fewer number of shareholders. If our larger shareholders were to decide to liquidate their ownership positions, it could cause significant fluctuations in the share price of our common stock. Having a limited number of shareholders also causes us to experience limited trading volume in our securities.

We intend to pay regular dividends to our shareholders, but our ability to do so is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. 
 
 We have consistently paid dividends each year since 2005, but the declaration, amount, and payment of dividends to our shareholders by us are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors takes into account general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans, our financial results and condition, any contractual, legal, and regulatory restrictions on our payment of dividends, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant to determining whether to declare dividends and the amount of such dividends. 
 
 Certain provisions in our employment agreements and bonus agreements with key personnel could delay or discourage an acquisition of the Company. 
 
 Our employment agreements with key personnel provide for certain payments in the event of certain terminations of employment of such persons or changes of control of the Company The obligation of the Company to make such payments upon the occurrence of such events could significantly increase the cost of an acquisition of the Company and make potential acquirers hesitant to proceed. 

ITEM 1C. 
 CYBERSECURITY 

We have policies and procedures for identifying, assessing, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats. We seek to address cybersecurity risks through a comprehensive approach focused on preserving the confidentiality, security, and availability of the information that we collect and store by identifying, preventing, and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur. We implement and maintain technical and physical safeguards and other organizational measures, including, for example, the use of antivirus software, intrusion prevention and detection systems, virtual private networks, firewalls, email security, link protection, the regular deployment of updates and patches as they become available, a general policy against providing access to our network to any third party (with the exception of our third party information technology vendor), the use of a third party service to conduct mandatory online training for all employees regarding identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks, regular phishing testing, regular penetration testing, regular reviews of access to systems and networks, and routine monitoring of compliance with our written information security plan. We also maintain cybersecurity insurance that provides for certain protection against potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident. 
 
 We have an Information Technology committee that meets at least quarterly and includes members of our management team and compliance team. The members of the Information Technology committee have gained cybersecurity experience through years of training, internal and external discussions, and the development, implementation, and periodic evaluation of our cybersecurity policies. 
 
 We have not experienced a material cybersecurity incident, any expenses we have incurred from cybersecurity breaches have been immaterial, and we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents that are reasonably likely to materially affect our business. Our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents. However, future incidents could have a material and adverse impact on our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. For additional discussion of the risks posed by cybersecurity threats, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 
 Our Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity risk management as part of its general oversight function. The Company s management team provides updates to the Board of Directors regarding cybersecurity as appropriate.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws, for which we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as expect, anticipate, intend, may, plan, will, should, could, would, assume, believe, estimate, predict, potential, project, continue, seek, and similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, based on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at which, or means by which, such performance or results will be achieved. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Unforeseen developments could cause actual performance or results to differ substantially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward looking statements. Management does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of these forward looking statements. There is no regulation requiring an update of any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. 
 
 Our business activities are affected by many factors, including, without limitation, redemptions by investors in the Hennessy Funds, taxes, general economic and business conditions, interest rate movements, inflation, the personal savings rate, competitive conditions, industry regulation, and fluctuations in the stock market, many of which are beyond the control of our management. Further, the business and regulatory environments in which we operate remain complex, uncertain, and subject to change. We expect that regulatory requirements and developments will cause us to incur additional administrative and compliance costs. Notwithstanding the variability in our economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of the Hennessy Funds and on providing high quality customer service to investors. 
 
 Our business strategy centers on (i) the identification, completion, and integration of future acquisitions and (ii) organic growth, through both the retention of the fund assets we currently manage and the generation of inflows into the funds we manage. The success of our business strategy may be influenced by the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. All statements regarding our business strategy, as well as statements regarding market trends and risks and assumptions about changes in the marketplace, are forward looking by their nature.

OVERVIEW 
 
 Our primary business activity is providing investment advisory services to a family of 16 open-end mutual funds and one ETF branded as the Hennessy Funds. We manage 12 of the 17 Hennessy Funds internally. For the remaining five funds, we have delegated the day to day portfolio management responsibilities to sub advisors, subject to our oversight. We oversee the selection and continued employment of each sub advisor, review each fund s investment performance, and monitor each sub advisor s adherence to each applicable fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions. In addition, we conduct ongoing reviews of the compliance programs of sub advisors and make onsite visits to sub advisors, as feasible. Our secondary business activity is providing shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds. 
 
 We derive our operating revenues from investment advisory fees paid to us by the Hennessy Funds and shareholder service fees paid to us by the Hennessy Mutual Funds. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net assets of each Hennessy Fund. The percentage amount of the investment advisory fees varies by fund. The percentage amount of the shareholder service fees is consistent across all Hennessy Mutual Funds, but shareholder service fees are charged on Investor Class shares only. The dollar amount of the fees we receive fluctuates with changes in the average net asset value of each Hennessy Fund, which is affected by each fund s investment performance, purchases and redemptions of shares, general market conditions, and the success of our marketing, sales, and public relations efforts. 
 
 U.S. equities had strong, positive performance for the one year period ended September 30, 2024, with the S P 500 Index returning 36.35 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average returning 28.85 for the period (on a total return basis). Equity prices advanced in anticipation of the Federal Reserve lowering its benchmark interest rate, which ultimately happened in September. Further, the markets have appeared to continue pricing in the prospect of several more rate cuts over the next year as market participants have appeared to continue to view recent inflation data in a favorable light. While lower short-term interest rates have propelled the market higher, a strong second quarter earnings season and the expectation of a reasonably robust third quarter earnings season seem to have given investors increased confidence that the economy is on firm footing. According to Bloomberg, consensus estimates call for the economy to grow 2.6 in 2024. While that rate is slightly behind last year s growth rate of 2.9 , we believe it is nonetheless a stronger rate than many had predicted at the beginning of the year. 
 
 Yields on long-term U.S. bonds decreased meaningfully during the one year period ended September 30, 2024, as the Federal Reserve has started to lower its benchmark interest rate. After the rate cut in September 2024, investors appear to have continued to price in further reductions in interest rates. According to Bloomberg, the market is currently pricing in nearly two more rate cuts by the end of the year and roughly six rate cuts by the end of 2025. Recent inflation data seems to have calmed the nerves of investors who feared that inflation would continue to be a headwind. Inflation data released for September 2024 indicated that consumer prices increased 2.4 from a year earlier, compared to 2.5 in August 2024, according to the Labor Department. The 2.4 rate is the smallest annual increase since February 2021 and now only modestly above the Federal Reserve s stated goal of 2.0 inflation. For the one year period ended September 30, 2024, 10-year U.S. Treasury Note yields fell from approximately 4.57 to 3.78 . 
 
 The Japanese equity market increased 21.6 (in U.S. dollar terms) for the one year period ended September 30, 2024, as measured by the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX). In our view, business sentiment in Japan remains strong, with the Bank of Japan stating that it expects large companies to increase capital spending by 10.6 in the current fiscal year through March 2025. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has said that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates as long as business conditions remain strong, which is expected to help keep inflation under control around 2.0 . 
 
 Against this positive equity performance backdrop, all 17 Hennessy Funds posted positive returns for the one year period ended September 30, 2024. The longer term performance numbers remain strong, with 15 of the Hennessy Funds posting positive returns for the three-year period ended September 30, 2024. Finally, all 16 Hennessy Funds with at least 10 years of operating history posted positive returns for both the 5-year and 10 year periods ended September 30, 2024.

As always, we are committed to providing superior service to investors and employing a consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy and hold philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. Our goal is to provide products that investors can have confidence in, knowing their money is invested as promised and with their best interests in mind. Accordingly, we continually seek new and improved ways to support investors in the Hennessy Funds, including by providing market insights, sector highlights, and other resources to help them manage their fund investments with confidence. We operate a robust and leading edge marketing automation and customer relationship management (CRM) system, with a database of over 100,000 financial advisors in addition to retail investors. We utilize this technology both to help retain assets and drive new purchases into the Hennessy Funds. We employ a comprehensive marketing and sales program consisting of content, digital, social media, and traditional marketing initiatives and proactive meetings. In addition, our consistent annual public relations campaign has resulted in the Hennessy brand name appearing on TV, radio, print, or online media on average once every two to three days. 
 
 We provide service to over 198,500 fund accounts nationwide, including accounts held by investors who employ financial advisors to assist them with investing as well as accounts held by retail investors who invest directly with us. We serve approximately 11,200 financial advisors who utilize the Hennessy Funds on behalf of their clients, including nearly 500 who purchased one of our Funds for the first time during fiscal year 2024. Approximately 18 of such advisors own two or more Hennessy Funds, and over 650 advisors hold a position of over 500,000. While numbers have declined in recent years, we continue to focus significant efforts on financial advisors who own two or more Hennessy Funds or hold a position of over 500,000 in an effort to build and maintain brand loyalty among our top tier of advisors. 
 
 Total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2024 was 4.6 billion, an increase of 1.6 billion, or 53.1 , compared to the end of fiscal year 2023. The increase in total assets was attributable to market appreciation, net inflows of the Hennessy Funds, and the purchase of assets related to the management of two mutual funds previously managed by CCM that were reorganized into the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF.

The principal asset on our balance sheet, the management contract asset, represents the capitalized costs incurred in connection with the purchase of assets related to the management of investment funds. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, this asset had a net balance of 82.3 million, an increase of 1.0 million since the end of fiscal year 2023. This increase is related to the purchase of assets related to the management of two mutual funds previously managed by CCM that were reorganized into the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF.

On October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of the 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875 per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of our future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of our future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinate to all future indebtedness and other obligations of any future subsidiaries of ours. The 2026 Notes are the principal liability on our balance sheet at 39.5 million, net of issuance costs. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 We continually review our capital requirements to ensure that we have funding available to support our business model. Management anticipates that cash and other liquid assets on hand as of the end of fiscal year 2024 will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for one year from the issuance date of this report, as well as our longer term capital requirements for periods beyond one year from the issuance date of this report. To the extent that liquid resources and cash provided by operations are not adequate to meet long-term capital requirements, management plans to raise additional capital by either, or both, seeking bank financing or accessing the capital markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital. 
 
 As discussed above, on October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of our 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2024 was 4.6 billion, an increase of 1.6 billion, or 53.1 , compared to the end of fiscal year 2023. The primary sources of our revenues, liquidity, and cash flow are our investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees, which are based on, and generated by, our average assets under management. Our average assets under management for fiscal year 2024 was 3.7 billion. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 63.9 million.

 The increase in cash used in financing activities of 0.2 million was due to repurchases of shares underlying vested restricted stock units RSUs from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the vesting of RSUs in the current period. 
 
 Dividend Payments . We have consistently paid dividends each year since 2005. Our quarterly dividend rate remained constant during fiscal years 2024 and 2023, and our dividend payments totaled 4.2 million in each such fiscal year. 
 
 2026 Notes . On October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of our 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 40.25 million, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option.

Revenue Investment Advisory Fees and Shareholder Service Fees 
 
 Total revenue comprises investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees. Comparing fiscal year 2024 to fiscal year 2023, total revenue increased by 23.4 , from 24.0 million to 29.6 million, investment advisory fees increased by 24.6 , from 22.1 million to 27.5 million, and shareholder service fees increased by 9.9 , from 1.9 million to 2.1 million. 
 
 The increase in investment advisory fees was due mainly to increased average daily net assets of the Hennessy Funds. The increase in shareholder service fees was due to an increase in the average daily net assets held in Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds. Assets held in Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds are subject to a shareholder service fee, whereas assets held in Institutional Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds are not subject to a shareholder service fee. 
 
 We collect investment advisory fees from each Hennessy Fund at differing annual rates. These annual rates range between 0.40 and 1.25 of average daily net assets. Average daily net assets of the Hennessy Funds for fiscal year 2024 was 3.7 billion, which represents an increase of 0.7 billion, or 23.2 , compared to fiscal year 2023. The Hennessy Fund with the largest average daily net assets for fiscal year 2024 was the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund, with 981 million. We collect an investment advisory fee from the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund at an annual rate of 0.74 of average daily net assets. The Hennessy Fund with the second largest average daily net assets for fiscal year 2024 was the Hennessy Focus Fund, with 645 million. We collect an investment advisory fee from the Hennessy Focus Fund at an annual rate of 0.90 of average daily net assets. However, we pay a sub advisory fee at an annual rate of 0.29 to the fund s sub advisor, which reduces the net operating profit contribution of the fund to our financial operations.

Total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2024 was 4.6 billion, an increase of 1.6 billion, or 53.1 , compared to the end of fiscal year 2023. The increase in total assets was attributable to market appreciation, net inflows of the Hennessy Funds, and the purchase of assets related to the management of two mutual funds previously managed by CCM that were reorganized into the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. 
 
 The Hennessy Funds with the three largest amounts of net inflows were as follows:

Redemptions as a percentage of assets under management decreased from an average of 2.5 per month during fiscal year 2023 to an average of 2.3 per month during fiscal year 2024. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, total operating expenses increased by 17.5 , from 17.7 million to 20.8 million. As a percentage of total revenue, total operating expenses decreased 3.5 percentage points to 70.1 . The increase in dollar value of operating expenses was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits Expense : Comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, compensation and benefits expense increased by 17.2 , from 7.7 million to 9.1 million. As a percentage of total revenue, compensation and benefits expense decreased 1.7 percentage points to 30.5 . The increase in dollar value of compensation and benefits expense was due primarily to an increase in incentive-based compensation during fiscal year 2024. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense : Comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, general and administrative expense increased by 18.3 from 5.5 million to 6.5 million. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expense decreased 0.9 percentage points to 21.9 . The dollar value increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases in sales and distribution expenses (not including fees paid to various financial institutions that offer the Hennessy Funds as potential investments to their clients, which are reflected in Fund Distribution and Other Expense ), as well as professional services expenses, in the current period. 
 
 Fund Distribution and Other Expense : The distribution component of fund distribution and other expense consists of fees paid to various financial institutions that offer the Hennessy Funds as potential investments to their clients. When the Hennessy Funds are purchased through one of these financial institutions, the institution typically charges an asset based fee, which is recorded as a fund distribution expense on our statement of operations to the extent paid by us. The Hennessy Mutual Funds, with the exception of the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF, may be purchased directly, and when purchased directly, we do not incur any such expense. These fees generally increase or decrease in line with the net assets of the Hennessy Funds held through these financial institutions, which are affected by inflows, outflows, and fund performance. In addition, some financial institutions charge a minimum fee if the average daily net assets of a Hennessy Fund held by such an institution are less than a threshold amount. In such cases, we pay the minimum fee. 

38

Table of Contents 

The distribution component of fund distribution and other expenses is affected by many factors, including the following: 

average daily net assets held by financial institutions; 

the split of average daily net assets held by financial institutions in Institutional Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds versus Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds; and 

fee minimums at various financial institutions. 

The other component of fund distribution and other expense consists of fees incurred by us for the operations of the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. We receive a unitary investment advisory fee from the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF and then pay all of its operating expenses (with limited exceptions), including fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agency, custody, licensing, audit, and tax services. 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, fund distribution and other expense increased by 68.3 , from 0.49 million to 0.82 million. As a percentage of total revenue, fund distribution and other expense increased 0.8 percentage points to 2.8 . The increase of fund distribution and other expense was due to increased average daily net assets of the Hennessy Mutual Funds, which in turn increases the fees we pay to financial institutions. Additionally, fund distribution and other expense increased due to the additional expenses relating to the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF resulting from the purchase of assets related to the management of the two mutual funds previously managed by CCM that were reorganized into the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. 
 
 Sub-Advisory Fees Expense : Comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, sub advisory fees expense increased by 10.9 , from 3.8 million to 4.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, sub advisory fees expense decreased 1.5 percentage points to 14.1 . The dollar value increase in sub advisory fees expense was due to an increase in average daily net assets of the sub advised Hennessy Funds, with an additional increase due to the expense associated with new sub advisory relationships relating to the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF that began in December 2022. 
 
 Depreciation Expense : Comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, depreciation expense increased by 6.1 from 0.23 million to 0.24 million due to additional fixed asset purchases. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation expense decreased 0.2 percentage points to 0.8 . 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, interest income increased from 2.52 million to 3.11 million. The increase was due to increased interest rates and increased principal balances. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, interest expense increased by 0.8 from 2.26 million to 2.28 million. The increase in interest expense was due to the manner in which interest expense is calculated under U.S. GAAP. The issuance costs related to the 2026 Notes that have been capitalized are amortized over time and therefore increase the carrying amount of the 2026 Notes. As the carrying amount of the 2026 Notes increases, the interest expense on the 2026 Notes for financial statement purposes also increases. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, income tax expense increased by 42.5 , from 1.8 million to 2.6 million. The increase in income tax expense was due to higher net operating income in the current period, partially offset by a lower effective income tax rate in the current period. The lower effective tax rate in the current period is due to an increased tax benefit in the current period due to restricted stock vesting at a higher share price. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024, net income increased by 48.8 , from 4.8 million to 7.1 million. The increase in net income was primarily due to increased average assets under management in the current period, which resulted in higher revenue and net operating income.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES 
 
 Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These accounting policies, methods, and estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting policies, methods, and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgment. Described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our results of operations and financial position. 
 
 Our operating revenues consist of contractual investment advisory and shareholder service fees. We earn our investment advisory fees through portfolio management of the Hennessy Funds, and we earn our shareholder service fees by assisting investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds. These fee revenues are earned and calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB guidance on revenue recognition, we recognize fee revenues monthly. Our contractual agreements provide persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists with fixed and determinable fees, and the services are rendered daily. The collectability is probable as the fees are received from the Hennessy Funds in the month subsequent to the month in which the services are provided. 
 
 The management contracts we have purchased are considered intangible assets with an indefinite life and we account for them in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 350: Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ). Pursuant to ASC 350, an entity first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If an entity determines that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired, then it must conduct an impairment analysis. We were able to forego the annual impairment analysis for fiscal year 2024 as the more-likely-than-not threshold was not met as of the end of fiscal year 2024. 
 
 The costs related to our purchase of assets related to the management of investment funds are capitalized as incurred. The costs are defined as an intangible asset per the FASB standard Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The acquisition costs include legal fees, fees for soliciting shareholder approval, and a percent of asset costs to purchase the management contracts. The amounts are included in the management contract asset, totaling 82.3 million as of the end of fiscal year 2024. 
 
 RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 
 We reviewed accounting pronouncements issued between December 7, 2023, the filing date of our most recent previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, and December 11, 2024, the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on our financial position, results of operations, and disclosures. 
 
 There have been no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during fiscal year 2024.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Hennessy Advisors, Inc.: 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Hennessy Advisors, Inc. (the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Valuation of the Management Contract Asset Impairment Consideration 
 
 As described in Note 1(f) to the financial statements, the Company has historically capitalized the cost of purchasing management contracts as intangible assets. These intangible assets are considered to have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized, but rather tested at least annually for impairment. As part of this annual test, management (i) evaluates whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment exists, and/or (ii) estimates the fair value of such intangible assets and compares it to the cost of the assets to 
 determine whether impairment has occurred. Management s estimate of the fair value of the management contract asset involves subjective assumptions that include stock market returns, fund flows and weighted average cost of capital. 
 
 We have determined that the valuation of the management contract asset constitutes a critical audit matter for the following reasons: (i) it is a matter that should be communicated to the audit committee, since it involves a significant management estimate; (ii) it involves a material account balance; and (iii) it involves especially subjective auditor judgment. 
 
 We have addressed this critical audit matter by performing appropriate audit procedures. These procedures included (i) assessing management s evaluation of whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment exists; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s fair value estimate assumptions; and (iii) testing the mathematical accuracy of management s valuation model. Professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the measurement of the Company s estimated fair value of the management contract asset.

Notes to Financial Statements 

open-end mutual funds and exchange traded fund ETF branded as the Hennessy Funds. The Company serves as the investment advisor to all classes of the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund, the Hennessy Focus Fund, the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund, the Hennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund, the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund, the Hennessy Total Return Fund, the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund, the Hennessy Balanced Fund, the Hennessy Energy Transition Fund, the Hennessy Midstream Fund, the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund, the Hennessy Japan Fund, the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund, the Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund, the Hennessy Small Cap Financial Fund, and the Hennessy Technology Fund (collectively, the Hennessy Mutual Funds ), as well as to the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. The Company also provides shareholder services to investors in the Hennessy Mutual Funds. 
 
 The employee retention credit ERC ), as originally enacted on March 27, 2020, by the CARES Act, was a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes equal to 50 of the qualified wages an eligible employer paid to employees and allowed claims through December 31, 2021, by eligible employers who retained employees during the COVID 19 pandemic. The Company filed Form 941 X to request an ERC from the Internal Revenue Service. In May 2023, the Company received an ERC of approximately million plus accrued interest. For profit entities do not have specific guidance to apply under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to account for ERCs and therefore follow guidance in accordance with Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance IAS 20 ). In accordance with IAS 20, the Company is netting the credit against related payroll expense in the current period. 
 
 The Company s operating revenues consist of contractual investment advisory and shareholder service fees paid to it by the Hennessy Funds. The Company earns investment advisory fees from each Hennessy Fund by, among other things: 
 
 acting as portfolio manager for the fund or overseeing the sub advisor acting as portfolio manager for the fund, which includes managing the composition of the fund s portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with the fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), seeking best execution for the fund s portfolio, managing the use of soft dollars for the fund, and managing proxy voting for the fund; 

performing a daily reconciliation of portfolio positions and cash for the fund; 

monitoring the liquidity of the fund; 

monitoring the fund s compliance with its investment objectives and restrictions and federal securities laws; 

maintaining a compliance program (including a code of ethics), conducting ongoing reviews of the compliance programs of the fund s service providers (including any sub advisor), including their codes of ethics, as appropriate, conducting on site visits to the fund s service providers (including any sub-advisor) as feasible, monitoring incidents of abusive trading practices, reviewing fund expense accruals, payments, and fixed expense ratios, evaluating insurance providers for fidelity bond, directors and officers and errors and omissions insurance, and cybersecurity insurance coverage, managing regulatory examination compliance and responses, conducting employee compliance training, reviewing reports provided by service providers, and maintaining books and records; 

if applicable, overseeing the selection and continued employment of the fund s sub advisor, reviewing the fund s investment performance, and monitoring the sub advisor s adherence to the fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions; 

overseeing service providers that provide accounting, administration, distribution, transfer agency, custodial, sales, marketing, public relations, audit, information technology, and legal services to the fund; 

maintaining in house marketing and distribution departments on behalf of the fund; 

preparing or directing the preparation of all regulatory filings for the fund, including writing and annually updating the fund s prospectus and related documents; 

for each annual report of the fund, preparing or reviewing a written summary of the fund s performance during the most recent 12 month period; 

monitoring and overseeing the accessibility of the fund on financial institution platforms; 

paying the incentive compensation of the fund s compliance officers and employing other staff such as legal, marketing, national accounts, distribution, sales, administrative, and trading oversight personnel, as well as management executives; 

providing a quarterly compliance certification to the Board of Trustees of Hennessy Funds Trust (the Funds Board of Trustees and 

preparing or reviewing materials for the Funds Board of Trustees, presenting to or leading discussions with the Funds Board of Trustees, preparing or reviewing all meeting minutes, and arranging for training and education of the Funds Board of Trustees. 

The Company earns shareholder service fees from Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Mutual Funds by, among other things, maintaining a toll free number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about their accounts and actively participating as a liaison between investors in the Hennessy Funds and U.S. Bank Global Fund Services. 
 
 Investment advisory and shareholder service fee revenues are earned and calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants at U.S. Bank Global Fund Services and are subsequently reviewed by management. 
 
 The Company recognizes revenues when its obligations related to the investment advisory and shareholder services are satisfied, and it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue amount would not occur in future periods. Management judgment is required in assessing the probability of significant revenue reversal and in identification of distinct services. Investment advisory and shareholder services are performed over time because investors in the Hennessy Funds are receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are based on contractual percentages of net asset values of each Hennessy Fund and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in net asset values, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation, and net inflows or outflows of the Hennessy Funds. Assets under management represent the broad range of financial assets the Company manages for the Hennessy Funds on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and shareholder servicing agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported assets under management reflect the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue. The fees are computed and billed monthly, at which time they are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 

The Company waives a portion of its fees with respect to the Hennessy Midstream Fund, the Hennessy Technology Fund, and the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF to comply with contractual expense ratio limitations. The fee waivers are calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants at U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, reviewed by management, and then charged to expense monthly as offsets to the Company s revenues. Each waived fee is then deducted from investment advisory fee income and reduces the aggregate amount of advisory fees the Company receives from such fund in the subsequent month. To date, the Company has only waived fees based on contractual obligations, but the Company has the ability to waive fees at its discretion. Any decision to waive fees would apply only on a going forward basis. 
 
 The Company s contractual agreements for investment advisory and shareholder services prove that a contract exists with fixed and determinable fees, and the services are rendered daily. The collectability is deemed probable because the fees are received from the Hennessy Funds in the month subsequent to the month in which the services are provided. 

per year were recognized in operations for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 Dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date. Purchases and sales of marketable securities are recorded on a trade date basis, and realized gains and losses recognized on sale are determined on a specific identification/average cost basis. 

more-likely-than- not impairment trigger as of such dates. 

Under Accounting Standards Codification 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. The Company considered various factors, such as likelihood of continued renewal, whether there are foreseeable limits on net cash flows, and whether the Company is dependent on a limited number of investors, in determining the useful life of the management contracts. Based on analysis, the Company considers the management contract asset to be an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life and no impairment as of the end of fiscal year 2024 . 
 
 The Company completed its most recent asset purchases on November 10, 2023, and February 23, 2024, when it purchased assets related to the management of the CCM Small/Mid-Cap Impact Value Fund and the CCM Core Impact Equity Fund (each, a CCM Fund ), respectively. These asset purchases added approximately million and million to the Company s assets under management at the time of closing with respect to the CCM Small/Mid-Cap Impact Value Fund and the CCM Core Impact Equity Fund, respectively. Each purchase was consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions of that certain Transaction Agreement, dated as of April 26, 2023, between the Company and Community Capital Management, LLC. Upon completion of each transaction, the assets of the applicable CCM Fund were reorganized into the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. In fiscal year 2024, the Company capitalized million in purchase price and other costs for the purchase of assets related to the management of the CCM Funds. 

The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Company s U.S. federal income taxes for 2019 through 2023 remain open and subject to examination. For state tax jurisdictions with unfiled tax returns, the statutes of limitations remains open indefinitely.

 The compensation committee of the Company s Board of Directors has the authority to determine the awards granted under the Omnibus Plan, including among other things, the individuals who receive the awards, the times when they receive them, vesting schedules, performance goals, whether an option is an incentive or nonqualified option, and the number of shares to be subject to each award.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan 
 
 In January 2024, the Company adopted an updated Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the DRSPP ), replacing the previous Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan that had been in place since 2021.

The increase was related to expenses incurred in connection with the purchase of assets related to the management of two mutual funds previously managed by CCM that were reorganized into the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. The Company considers the management contract asset to be an intangible asset per Accounting Standards Codification 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The purchase costs that comprise the management contract asset include consideration to the seller, as well as legal and similar external transaction costs. 

Hennessy Funds. 

The investment advisory agreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) by (a) the Funds Board of Trustees or the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund and (b) the vote of a majority of the trustees of Hennessy Funds Trust who are not interested persons of the Hennessy Funds. If an investment advisory agreement is not renewed, it terminates automatically. There are two additional circumstances in which an investment advisory agreement terminates. First, an investment advisory agreement automatically terminates if the Company assigns it to another advisor (assignment includes indirect assignment, which is the direct or indirect transfer of the Company s common stock in sufficient quantities deemed to constitute a controlling block). Second, an investment advisory agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration upon days written notice by either the applicable Hennessy Fund or the Company. 
 
 As provided in each investment advisory agreement, the Company receives investment advisory fees monthly based on a percentage of the applicable fund s average daily net asset value. 
 
 The Company has entered into sub-advisory agreements for the Hennessy Focus Fund, the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund, the Hennessy Japan Fund, the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund, and the Hennessy Stance ESG ETF. Under each of these sub-advisory agreements, the sub advisor is responsible for the investment and reinvestments of the assets of the applicable Hennessy Fund in accordance with the terms of such agreement and the applicable Hennessy Fund s Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information. The sub advisors are subject to the direction, supervision, and control of the Company and the Funds Board of Trustees. The sub advisory agreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) in the same manner as, and are subject to the same termination provisions as, the investment advisory agreements. 
 
 In exchange for the sub-advisory services, the Company not the Hennessy Funds) pays sub-advisory fees to the sub-advisors out of its own assets. Sub advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of the applicable sub advised fund s average daily net asset value. 

long term operating leases as of September 30, 2023. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company renewed the lease for its office in Novato, California for an additional three years. The renewed lease will expire on July 31, 2027 . The renewal created a long term operating lease asset recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. There were other long term operating leases as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Upon renewal of the lease for its office in Novato, California, the Company recorded a right of use asset of million on its balance sheet. Right of use assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The Company s lease terms may include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise any such options. For its leases, the Company concluded that it is not reasonably certain that any renewal options would be exercised, and, therefore, the amounts are not recognized as part of operating lease right of use assets or operating lease liabilities. Leases with initial terms of 12 months or less, and certain office equipment leases that are deemed insignificant, are not recorded on the balance sheet and are expensed as incurred and included within rent expense under general and administrative expense. Lease expense related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease terms. 

The Company s most significant leases are real estate leases of office facilities. The Company leases office space under non-cancelable operating leases. Its principal executive office is located in Novato, California, and it has additional offices in Austin, Texas, Dallas, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Only the office lease in Novato, California has been capitalized because the other operating leases have terms of 12 months or less, including leases that are month to month in nature. The classification of the Company s operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities and other supplemental information related to the Company s operating leases are as follows: 

Current operating lease liability 
 Long-term operating lease liability 
 Weighted average remaining lease term 
 Weighted average discount rate 
 Operating lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets 

For fiscal years 2024 and 2023 , the Company s lease payments related to its operating lease right-of-use assets totaled million and million, respectively, and total rent expense for all offices, which is recorded under general and administrative expense in the statements of income, totaled million and million, respectively. 
 
 The undiscounted cash flows for future maturities of the Company s operating lease liabilities and the reconciliation to the balance of operating lease liabilities reflected on the Company s balance sheet are as follows:

The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875 per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026 . 

The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company s future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of the Company s future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of the Company s future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinate to all future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company s future subsidiaries. 

million and million, respectively. To date, the Company has only waived fees based on contractual obligations but has the ability to waive fees at its discretion. Any decision to waive fees would apply only on a going forward basis. 
 
 In November 2024, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with respect to employment-related claims made by a former employee in fiscal year 2024. The Company believed the settlement provided for an efficient and effective resolution to the matter. The Company has employment practices liability insurance for such claims, and therefore paid the amount of the settlement not covered by the employment practices liability insurance. 
 
 The Company has other commitments and no significant contingencies with original terms in excess of one year.

million and million, respectively. If the tax benefits of such amounts were recognized, million and 0.3 million of such amounts, respectively, would decrease the Company s effective income tax rate. As of September 30, 2024 , and September 30, 2023 ,the Company s net liability for accrued interest and penalties was million and 0.3 million, respectively. The Company has elected to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company recognized approximately million in interest and penalties during each of the years ended September 30, 2024 , and September 30, 2023 . 
 
 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

Changes related to prior year tax positions 
 Ending year balance 

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to final regulations, audit settlements, tax examinations activities, lapse of applicable statutes of limitations, and the recognition and measurement criteria under the guidance related to accounting for uncertainly in income taxes. The Company is unable to estimate what this change could be within the next 12 months, but does not believe it would be material to its financial statements. 

The Company s income tax expense was as follows: 

State 
 Total current 
 Deferred 
 Federal 
 State 
 Total deferred 
 Total 

The principal reasons for the differences from the federal statutory income tax rate and the Company s effective tax rate were as follows: 

State income taxes, net of federal benefit 
 Permanent and other differences 
 Difference due to executive compensation 
 Tax return to provision adjustments 
 Uncertain tax position 
 Stock-based compensation 
 Effective income tax rate 

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

 Capital loss carryforward 
 Lease liability 
 Gross deferred tax assets 
 Disallowed capital loss 
 Net deferred tax assets

ITEM 9A. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

MANAGEMENT S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a 15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, using the criteria set forth in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS 
 
 There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, and that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

III. 

PERSONAL SECURITIES INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS POLICY 

Rule 17j 1 under the Investment Company Act and Rule 240A 1 under the Advisers Act require the reporting of all personal securities transactions (with certain limited exceptions) and preclearance of certain personal securities investment transactions by persons who are involved in the investment activities of HFT or the Adviser or who have access to non public information regarding purchases or sales of securities or the portfolio holdings of any of the Funds. This policy implements the requirements of those rules and also sets forth additional procedures that are intended to avoid any actual or apparent conflicts of interest that may arise from personal securities investment transactions. 

A. 

General 

Subject to the limited exclusions set forth in Section III.C below, all Access Persons are required to report holdings and transactions in Covered Securities with respect to which they have discretionary authority or beneficial ownership. In addition, subject to the limited exclusions set forth in Section III.C below, no Access Person (or certain of his or her family members as described in Section III.B below) shall buy or sell any Covered Security for any account over which such Access Person has discretionary authority or for an account in which such Access Person has, or as a result of the transaction acquires, any direct or indirect beneficial ownership (referred to herein as a personal securities transaction unless: 

such Access Person has obtained preclearance of such transaction in accordance with the procedures described in Section III.D.7 below; and 

the transaction is reported in writing to the CCOs of HFT and the Adviser on a quarterly basis in accordance with the requirements of Section III.E.3 below. 

Except as otherwise specifically provided therein, (1) Disinterested Trustees are not subject to the restrictions and limitations or reporting requirements set forth in Sections III.D and III.E and (2) non executive directors of the Advisor who do not have access to nonpublic information regarding securities recommendations, securities transactions, or portfolio holdings for the Funds and are not involved in making securities recommendations to the Funds are not subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in Section III.D.

such person; 

such person s spouse or minor child; 

a relative (including in laws, stepchildren, or stepparents) sharing the same house; or 

anyone else if such person is able to: 

o 

obtain benefits substantially equivalent to ownership of the securities; or 

o 

obtain ownership of the securities immediately or at some future time. 

C.

b. 

purchases or sales that are non-volitional on the part of the Access Person. 

2.

d. 

purchases, sales, or gifts of shares issued by HFT; 

e. 

purchases, sales, or gifts of exchange traded funds; and

in kind transfers. 

D. 

Restrictions and Limitations on Personal Securities Transactions 

The provisions of this Section III.D apply to all Access Persons, except they do not apply to Disinterested Trustees other than as specifically set forth in Section III.D.3 below and they do not apply to non executive directors of the Advisor who do not have access to nonpublic information regarding securities recommendations, securities transactions, or portfolio holdings for the Funds and who are not involved in making securities recommendations to the Funds . 

Any personal securities transaction by an Access Person in violation of this Code may be required to be reversed and any resulting profits may be subject to disgorgement. 

1. 

Participation in Initial Public Offerings 

No Access Person may acquire any Covered Security in an Initial Public Offering without the prior approval of the CCOs of HFT and the Adviser. 

2. 

Participation in Private Placements 

No Access Person may participate in a private placement of any kind (including, but not limited to, investments in limited partnership, limited liability companies, hedge funds, private equity funds, PIPEs, real estate, oil and gas partnerships, and venture capital investments) without the prior approval of the CCOs of HFT and the Adviser. 

3. 

Trading in a Security on a Day When There Is a Buy or Sell Order or Serious Consideration Thereof 

No Access Person may purchase or sell, directly or indirectly, any Covered Security on any day during which (a) the Adviser has placed a buy or sell order in the same security for a Fund or (b) to the actual knowledge of such Access Person at the time of such purchase or sale, the same security is being considered for purchase or sale by a Fund. 

Disinterested Trustees are subject to this prohibition if they know or should have known at the time of such purchase or sale that the Adviser has such a pending buy or sell order in the same security for the Fund. 

4. 

Blackout Period 

No Access Person may purchase or sell, directly or indirectly, a Covered Security within one trading day after the Adviser has purchased or sold the same security for a Fund. 

7

Code of Ethics

August 2023

5. 

Short Swing Profits 

No Access Person may profit from the purchase and sale or sale and purchase within 14 calendar days of the same or equivalent security if trading in such security is subject to preclearance in accordance with the procedures described in Section III.D.7. This Section III.D.5 does not prohibit the avoidance of losses through trading within a period shorter than 14 calendar days. 

6. 

Restricted List 

HFT and the Adviser may from time to time establish a restricted list that includes the names of companies for which HFT or the Adviser may have, or are in a position to receive, material non public information. Access Persons are not allowed to trade or invest in the securities of any company on the restricted list. 

7. 

Preclearance Requirements 

Access Persons must obtain preclearance of all personal securities transactions in Covered Securities that are not exempted by Section III.C through the ComplianceAlpha system or any alternative procedures as may be announced following the approval of the CCOs of HFT and the Adviser. Access Persons will receive notification regarding whether their preclearance request is approved or denied, but the specific reason for the decision is not required to be provided. If a preclearance request for a personal securities transaction submitted by an Access Person is denied, such Access Person is prohibited from executing such personal securities transaction. If the personal securities transaction is not completed on the date of preclearance, a new preclearance must be obtained prior to executing any remaining portion of such personal securities transaction (unless the approval specifically states that it will remain in effect for a longer period of time, in which case the specified time period applies). If an Access Person believes he or she may not be able to complete a personal securities transaction in a single trading day because of limited liquidity in the applicable security, he or she may request that the preclearance approval extend for up to five days. Such requests will be considered on a case by case basis based on the facts and circumstances known at the time. Approval of a preclearance request for a personal securities transaction that has not yet been executed may be revoked at any time if new information makes revocation advisable. 

E. 

Reporting Procedures 

The provisions of this Section III.E apply to all Access Persons, except they do not apply to Disinterested Trustees other than as specifically set forth in Section III.E.1 below . If desired, an Access Person may include a statement on any report filed pursuant to Sections III.E.2 III.E.4 below that the report shall not be construed as an admission by such Access Person that he or she has any beneficial ownership in the security to which the report relates. 

8

Code of Ethics

August 2023

1.

Additionally, Disinterested Trustees do not need to file a quarterly transaction report pursuant to Section III.E.3 below except to report a personal securities transaction in a Covered Security if such Disinterested Trustee, at the time of making such personal securities transaction, knew or, in the ordinary course of fulfilling his or her official duties as a trustee of HFT, should have known that, during the 15-day period immediately before or after the date of such personal securities transaction, such Covered Security was purchased or sold by a Fund or was being considered by a Fund or the Adviser for purchase or sale by a Fund. 

2.

c. 

the date the report is submitted by such Access Person. 

5. 

Review of Periodic Reports; Identification of Access Person 

The CCOs of HFT and the Adviser or their designees shall review all reports filed by Access Persons pursuant to this Section III. The CCOs of HFT and the Adviser shall identify all Access Persons who are required to file reports pursuant to Section III.E and must inform such Access Persons of their reporting obligations. 

IV. INSIDER TRADING POLICY 

HFT and the Adviser prohibit their directors, trustees, officers, and employees from trading, either personally or on behalf of the Funds, on the basis of material non public information or communicating material non public information to others in violation of the Law. In addition, communication of inside information (tipping) to a third party, where improper trading can be anticipated, is also strictly prohibited. This conduct is frequently referred to as insider trading. In addition, each of HFT and the Advisor, as an entity, is prohibited from trading on the basis of material non public information or communicating material non public information to others in violation of the Law. 

In addition to applying to the directors, trustees, officers, and employees of HFT and the Adviser, this policy also applies to their respective spouses, children, and relatives sharing a home with them, and certain trusts, partnerships, and corporations affiliated with them. 

Insider trading Laws are continuously changing. In the event an individual has any hesitation about whether or not something may be considered insider trading, such individual should immediately discuss the matter with the Chief Compliance Officer of HFT or the Adviser. Seeking guidance if there is even the slightest hesitation is likely to prevent disciplinary action or complex legal problems. 

A. 

What is Material Information? 

Material information generally means information that a reasonable investor would consider important in deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a security, or information that is reasonably certain to have a substantial effect on the price of a company s securities once such information becomes publicly available. Both positive and negative information may be material. Information that may be considered material includes, but is not limited to: 

earnings estimates or changes in previously released earnings estimates; 

pending changes in corporate policy (such as dividend changes or stock splits); 

significant new products, services, or processes; 

pending large commercial or government contracts; 

11

Code of Ethics

August 2023

the gain or loss of a substantial customer; 

pending litigation or changes in the status of litigation; 

a significant refinancing transaction; 

news of a pending acquisition or sale of assets or a proposed merger or tender offer; 

government investigations; or 

changes in management. 

Material information may also relate to the market for a company s securities. Information about a significant order to purchase or sell securities may be material in some instances. 

No simple test exists to determine whether information is material. Assessments of materiality involve a highly fact specific analysis. Since the question of whether inside information is material is determined in litigation with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, individuals should consult the CCO of HFT or the Adviser if they are in receipt of any non public information, regardless of whether or not they believe it is material. 

B. 

What is Non Public Information? 

Information is non public until it has been disclosed in a manner sufficient to ensure availability to the investing public and sufficient time has passed since its dissemination for investors to have absorbed the information (which is generally measured in days and not minutes). For example, information in a report filed with the SEC or appearing in the Wall Street Journal or other publication of general circulation would be considered public after a sufficient amount of time has passed since its publication. 

C. 

What are the Penalties for Insider Trading? 

The federal securities laws impose potentially severe penalties on persons who trade securities while in possession of material non public information or who improperly disclose material non public information to others. Individuals who trade on (or tip) inside information may face one or more of the following consequences: 

termination of such individual s employment or other relationship with HFT and the Adviser; 

criminal sanctions, which may include a fine of up to 5 million and up to 20 years imprisonment; 

disgorgement of the profits gained or losses avoided through insider trading and a penalty of up to three times such amount; 

12

Code of Ethics

August 2023

an SEC order permanently barring such individual from the securities industry; and 

a lawsuit by investors seeking to recover damages for insider trading violations. 

Similar penalties may be imposed against so called controlling persons who fail to take appropriate steps to prevent or detect insider trading violations (including tipping violations) by their employees or subordinates. 

HFT and the Adviser may also be subject to penalties in the event a director, trustee, officer, or employee is found liable for insider trading, including: 

civil penalties of up to the greater of 1 million or three times the amount of profits gained or losses avoided by such individual; 

criminal fines of up to 25 million; and 

restrictions on their ability to conduct their business activities. 

D. 

Compliance Procedures 

The following procedures have been established to help directors, trustees, officers, and employees of HFT and the Adviser avoid insider trading and to help HFT and the Adviser prevent, detect, and impose sanctions against individuals who engage in insider trading. 

1. 

Identifying Inside Information 

Before executing any personal trade or trade for the Funds, a director, trustee, officer, or employee of HFT or the Adviser must determine whether they have access to material, non public information. The following questions are relevant to such a determination: 

a. 

Is the information material? Would an investor consider this information important in making his or her investment decision? If disclosed, would this information substantially affect the market price of the securities? 

b. 

Is the information non public? Has the information been effectively communicated to the marketplace by appearing in publications of general circulation? Is the information readily available to a significant number of other investors in the market? How much time has passed since the information was disseminated? 

If, after consideration of the foregoing matters, an individual believes information is material and non public or is not sure about whether such information is material and non public, he or she should take the following steps: 

a. 

immediately report the information to the CCO of HFT or the Adviser; 

13

Code of Ethics

August 2023

b. 

refrain from purchasing or selling any securities to which the information is relevant; and 

c. 

refrain from communicating the information to anyone inside or outside of HFT and the Adviser other than the CCOs of HFT and the Adviser and other individuals who need to know such information in order to perform their job responsibilities. 

2. 

Restricting Access to Material Non Public Information 

a. 

Communications 

Access to material non public information must be limited to only those individuals who have a need to know. 

b. 

Information Handling 

Directors, trustees, officers, and employees of HFT and the Adviser should take all appropriate actions to safeguard any material non public information in their possession. Such information should be kept secure. For example, documents or papers containing material non public information should not be left on desks or otherwise where it may be seen by other people, and access to files (whether hard copy or electronic) containing material non public information should be restricted. 

In addition, material non public information should not be discussed in public or quasi public places where conversations may be overheard by others. 

E. 

Securities Issued by the Adviser 

1. 

General 

Insider trading Laws apply to the securities of the Adviser the same as they apply to the securities of any issuer. However, because there is a higher likelihood of access to material non public information regarding the Adviser than regarding other companies, additional procedures are warranted. 

In addition to the procedures set forth in Section IV.D, the following additional procedures are designed to help ensure that all material non public information regarding the Adviser remains confidential: 

tips about material non public information regarding the Adviser should never be given to anyone who may, directly or indirectly, use such information to derive an improper personal benefit through personal trading in the Adviser s stock or by passing the tip on to others; and 

all inquiries regarding the Adviser from the press or other news media must be referred to the Chief Executive Officer or President of the Adviser (who may authorize any employee to speak to the press or other news media outlet about the Adviser on a case by case basis). 

14

Code of Ethics

August 2023

If an individual becomes aware of a leak of inside information regarding the Adviser, he or she should immediately report the leak to the CCO of the Adviser. The Adviser is required under Regulation FD of the federal securities laws to avoid the selective disclosure of material non public information. 

2. 

Quiet Period 

Directors, trustees, officers, and employees of HFT and the Adviser may not purchase or sell any securities of the Adviser during the period beginning on the first day of each quarter and ending on the second business day after public announcement of quarterly or (in the case of the fourth fiscal quarter) annual results for the prior period or during any other period declared to be a quiet period by the CCO of the Adviser. All personal securities transactions in securities of the Adviser must be precleared in accordance with Section III.D.7 regardless of whether such purchase or sale is outside of a quiet period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participant in any equity incentive plan of the Adviser as may be in effect from time to time may elect, either during or outside of a quiet period, to have the Adviser withhold shares of the Adviser s common stock otherwise deliverable or vesting under an award to satisfy any federal, state, or local tax obligations, and the Adviser may withhold such shares, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such equity incentive plan; provided that the CCO of the Adviser may in his or her discretion suspend the right to make any such election. The submission of such an election by a participant shall serve as a preclearance request under Section III.D.7. 

3. 

Reporting of Stock Transactions to SEC 

The Personal Securities Investment Transactions Policy set forth in Section III is designed to implement the requirements of Rule 17j 1 under the Investment Company Act and Rule 240A 1 under the Advisers Act, as well as to assist directors and executive officers in complying with the filing and short swing insider trading liability provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. As a general rule, transactions in securities of the Adviser (including the receipt or exercise of stock options) by directors, executive officers, 10 or more shareholders, and their related persons are required to be reported to the SEC on Form 4 within two business days of the transaction. Because the Form 4 must be filed with the SEC within the two business day deadline, it is critical for the Adviser to be aware of transactions in its securities by insiders ahead of time so that it may assist with making the required filings. Most changes of ownership must be reported even if there has been no net change in holdings. Certain transactions such as gifts may be reported on a deferred basis on Form 5. If any transactions are reported late, the Adviser must disclose such late filings in its annual meeting proxy statement. Furthermore, the SEC has authority to impose civil fines and issue cease and desist orders for late filings. 

15

Code of Ethics

August 2023

The Form 4 and 5 reporting requirements are designed, among other things, to assist with enforcing the short swing insider trading liability provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. The Personal Securities Investment Transactions Policy set forth in Section III is also designed to help reporting persons avoid short-swing insider trading liability. Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act provides that any profit on a purchase and sale of securities of an issuer by a director, executive officer, or a 10 or more shareholder of such issuer within any six-month period must be paid to the issuer unless certain exemptions apply. Profit is computed by matching any sale of Company stock taking place at a higher price than a purchase taking place within six months before or after the sale, regardless of the seller s tax basis in specifically identified shares sold. Intent to take unfair advantage of inside information is not required for liability under Section 16(b). 

4. 

No Short Sales 

Section 16(c) of the Exchange Act prohibits directors, executive officers, and 10 or more shareholders from making short sales of the securities of the Adviser. A short sale occurs when an investor sells borrowed securities (in anticipation of a price decline) and is required to return an equal number of shares at some predefined point in the future. 

5. 

Rule 10b5 1 Plans 

The implementation, modification, or termination of any Rule 10b5 1 plan under the Exchange Act by the Adviser or any director, trustee, officer, or employee of HFT or the Adviser must be approved in advance by external or internal legal counsel to the Adviser. 

V. COMPLIANCE 

A. 

Approval of the Code of Ethics 

1. 

The Board of Trustees of HFT, including a majority of the Disinterested Trustees, and the Board of Directors of the Adviser shall approve this Code and any material changes thereto. Prior to approving this Code and any material changes thereto, the Board of Trustees of HFT, including a majority of the Disinterested Trustees, must determine that this Code contains provisions reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating Rule 17j-1(b) under the Investment Company Act. 

2. 

No less frequently than annually, the CCOs of HFT and the Adviser shall furnish a report to the Board of Trustees of HFT and the Board of Directors of the Adviser that includes the following: 

a. 

a description of all issues arising under the Code since the last report to such Boards, including, but not limited to, information about material violations of this Code and sanctions imposed in response to such material violations;

16

Code of Ethics

August 2023

c. 

a certification that HFT and the Adviser have adopted such procedures as are reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating this Code. 

3. 

Any explicit or implied waivers of this Code for directors, trustees, or executive officers must be approved by the Board of Trustees of HFT and the Board of Directors or Audit Committee of the Adviser, as applicable, and must be promptly disclosed. 

B. 

Annual Certification 

Each year, the CCOs of HFT and the Adviser shall provide all directors, trustees, officers, and employees with a copy of this Code. Promptly following receipt thereof, each such person shall certify to HFT and to the Adviser that he or she (1) has read and understands this Code and recognizes that he or she is subject thereto, (2) has complied with the requirements of this Code, and (3) has disclosed or reported all personal securities transactions required to be disclosed or reported pursuant to the requirements of this Code. 

C. 

Prohibition on Self Clearance 

No director, trustee, officer, or employee may preclear his or her own trades, review his or her own required trading reports, or otherwise serve as the final point of review of his or her own actions under this Code. To the extent this Code requires action by a CCO and the CCO also engages in personal securities transactions, such CCO s responsibilities under this Code with respect to such CCO s personal securities transactions shall be carried out by the other CCO or an appropriate designee. 

D. 

Other Obligations 

Compliance with this Code does not relieve directors, trustees, officers, or employees of their obligations under any other code of ethics. 

E. 

Maintenance of Records 

This Code and the approvals and reports required by Section V.A shall be maintained by the Funds administrator and the CCOs of HFT and the Adviser. The reports required by Section III.E shall be maintained by the CCO of HFT. 

F. 

Interpretation and Enforcement 

1. 

This is a combined Code of Ethics for HFT and the Adviser. The Board of Directors of the Adviser (or a committee thereof) is responsible for overseeing the interpretation and enforcement of this Code in all matters related to the Adviser. The Board of Trustees of HFT is responsible for overseeing the interpretation and enforcement of this Code in all matters related to HFT. 

17

Code of Ethics

August 2023

2. 

Each director, trustee, officer, and employee will be held accountable for his or her adherence to this Code by the Board of Trustees of HFT or the Board of Directors of the Adviser, as applicable. Directors, trustees, officers, and employees who fail to adhere to this Code will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, ranging from warnings to possible termination or removal.
