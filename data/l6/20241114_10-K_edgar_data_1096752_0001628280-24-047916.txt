PART I 

Item 1. Business. 
 Overview 
 Edgewell Personal Care Company, and its subsidiaries, is one of the world s largest manufacturers and marketers of personal care products in the Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care, and Feminine Care segments. With operations in approximately 20 countries, our products are widely available in more than 50 countries. 
 
 History and Development 
 We were incorporated in the State of Missouri on September 23, 1999 and, prior to April 2000, were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ralston Purina Company. On April 1, 2000, all of the outstanding shares of our common stock were distributed to shareholders of Ralston Purina Company and we became an independent publicly-owned company. During the years that followed, we implemented a strategy of acquiring several personal care brands, which created the foundation for the company we are today. 
 In 2003, we completed the acquisition of the Schick-Wilkinson Sword business SWS from Pfizer, Inc., the second largest manufacturer and marketer of men s and women s wet shave products in the world at that time. Our portfolio of wet shave products includes: Hydro and Quattro men s shaving systems; Hydro Silk , Quattro for Women , Intuition and Silk Effects Plus women s shaving systems; and the Hydro, Quattro, Xtreme 3 , Slim Twin , Slim Triple , Skintimate and Extra3 disposables. SWS has over 100 years of history in the shaving products industry with a reputation for high quality and innovation in shaving technology. SWS products are sold throughout the world. 
 In 2007, we acquired Playtex Products, Inc. Playtex ), a leading manufacturer and marketer of well-recognized brands such as Playtex feminine care products, Wet Ones pre-moistened wipes, and Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic sun care products, thereby expanding our branded consumer products portfolio. 
 In 2009, we completed the acquisition of the Edge and Skintimate shave preparation brands from S.C. Johnson Son, Inc., adding market leading United States-based U.S. shave preparation brands to our existing wet shave product portfolio. In 2010, we completed the acquisition of American Safety Razor, LLC ASR ), a leading global manufacturer of private label and value wet shaving razors and blades and specialty blades. 
 Strengthening our company s feminine care product portfolio, in 2013 we acquired the Stayfree pad, Carefree liner and o.b. tampon feminine hygiene brands in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean from Johnson Johnson. 
 In 2015, we completed the separation of our Household Products business, which manufactures and markets batteries and portable lighting, into a separate publicly-owned company (the Spin or the Separation ). We completed the tax-free Separation by distributing 100 of the outstanding shares of common stock of Energizer SpinCo, Inc. to our shareholders. The newly formed company assumed the name Energizer Holdings, Inc. New Energizer and began trading under the symbol ENR on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE ). Edgewell retained the Personal Care business and trades on the NYSE under the symbol EPC. Following the Separation, we do not beneficially own any shares of New Energizer. In connection with the Separation, we changed our name to Edgewell Personal Care Company on June 30, 2015. 
 In recent years, we have entered the men s grooming and skin care markets through several acquisitions. On October 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Bulldog Skincare Holdings Limited Bulldog ), a men s grooming and skincare company based in the United Kingdom U.K. ). On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Jack Black, L.L.C. Jack Black ), a men s luxury skincare company based in the U.S. On September 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Cremo Holding Company, LLC Cremo ), a U.S.-based masstige men s grooming brand. On November 29, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Billie, Inc. Billie ), a high-quality shaving and premium body care brand which strengthens our women s Wet Shave and grooming product portfolio (the Billie Acquisition ). These more recent acquisitions have created opportunities to expand our personal care portfolio into the growing, global grooming category and have allowed us to leverage our international geographic footprint.

Our Business Segments and Product Strategies 
 We manage our business in three operating segments: Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care, and Feminine Care. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment operating profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses, share-based compensation costs, costs associated with restructuring initiatives and other items that are not representative of management s view on how segment performance is evaluated. Information regarding the product portfolios of these segments is included within the following discussion. Financial information regarding each of our reportable segments, as well as other geographical information, is included in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Wet Shave 
 Wet Shave products are sold under the Schick , Wilkinson Sword , Edge, Skintimate , Billie , Shave Guard and our custom brands group (formerly sold under our Shave Guard and Personna brands). We manufacture and distribute Schick and Wilkinson Sword razor systems, composed of razor handles and refillable blades, and disposable shave products for men and women. While we market our wet shave products throughout the world, our primary markets are the U.S., Canada, Japan, Germany, France and the U.K. We believe we hold the number two global market share position in wet shaving. The category is highly competitive, with brands vying for consumer loyalty and retail shelf space. 
 Billie s strong direct-to-consumer and digital capabilities have underpinned its strong growth, which positioned the brand well for its initial expansion into U.S. brick-and-mortar in 2022. The Billie brand complements and strengthens Edgewell s position in the women s shaving category, adding to our portfolio of strong brands such as Schick Intuition, Hydro Silk and Skintimate. 
 In the U.S., Canada and Japan, we sell market-leading shave preparation products, including shaving gels and creams under the Edge, Skintimate and Shave Guard brands. 
 We also manufacture, distribute and sell a complete line of private label and disposable razors, shaving systems and replacement blades. These private label wet shave products including emerging direct-to-consumer DTC brands, are sold primarily under a retailer s store name or under our value brand names such as Edgewell Custom Brands. 
 
 Sun and Skin Care 
 Sun and Skin Care products are sold under the Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic, Bulldog , Jack Black , Cremo and Wet Ones brand names. We market Sun Care products under the Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic brands and believe these brands, on a combined basis, hold a leading market share position in the U.S. Sun Care category. We largely compete across the full spectrum of Sun Care categories: general protection, sport, kids, baby, tanning and after sun. Outside of the U.S., we believe we are also the leading Sun Care manufacturer in Mexico with significant presence in Australia and Canada. We expect to continue to drive our worldwide Sun and Skin Care business through product innovation, increased distribution and geographic expansion. 
 We offer Wet Ones antibacterial hand wipes and other related products as the leader in the U.S. portable hand wipes category. We expect to utilize our position as market leader to further scale the business and use innovation to increase growth. 
 We have acquired a portfolio of men s grooming skin care products that have grown under our direction. Our Bulldog skincare products are purpose-built for men and were created to work simply and efficiently while dealing with issues specific to men s skin. Since acquiring Bulldog, we have expanded sales geographically and we continue to commit resources to further growth and distribution for the brand. We acquired the Jack Black brand and obtained a footprint in the luxury men s skincare market and continue to use resources at our disposal to grow the Jack Black brand globally. Our Cremo products compete in the masstige category for men s grooming and offer a complete line of barber quality beard, hair and skin care products. 
 
 Feminine Care 
 In Feminine Care, we market products under the Playtex, Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. brands. We offer tampons under the Playtex Gentle Glide 360 , Playtex Sport , Playtex and o.b. brands. We also market pads and liners under the Stayfree and Carefree brands. We believe we are one of the top three manufacturers of feminine care products in North America, with unique, competitive product technologies and well-known brands that address complementary consumer needs. We expect to continue to invest in innovation in our feminine care brands.

Competition 
 The personal care product categories in which we compete are highly competitive, both in the U.S. and in most international markets, as large manufacturers with global operations and new entrants attempting to disrupt the market compete for consumer acceptance and increasingly limited retail shelf space. Competition is based upon several factors, including, but not limited to, brand quality and perception, product formulation and performance, customer service and price and promotion. 
 
 Wet Shave 
 The global shaving products category is comprised of wet shave blades and razors, electric shavers, and shaving gels and creams. With our established brands and product lines and global presence, we believe we compete effectively in this segment. Our principal competitors in the global wet shave business are: The Procter Gamble Company, which owns the Gillette brand and is the leading company in the global wet shave segment; The Bic Group, which is expanding beyond its historical strength in the disposable segment; and Dorco, which competes primarily in the private label segment. We also compete with newer entrants to the Wet Shave market for both DTC and traditional retail shelf space including Harry's, Flamingos, Estrid, Athena Club, Perio (Barbasol and PureSilk brands), Beiersdorf (Nivea branded women s wet shave product in Germany) and numerous other online start-ups. 
 
 Sun and Skin Care 
 The markets for sun and skin care are also highly competitive, characterized by the frequent introduction of new products accompanied by major advertising and promotional programs. Our competitors in these markets consist of a large number of domestic and foreign companies, including Bayer AG and Kenvue. 
 The Sun Care category is highly regulated and competitive, and increasingly interacts with and is impacted by trends in the skin category. With our balanced Sun Care portfolio, depth of product formulation and manufacturing expertise and global presence, we believe we compete effectively across markets. We intend to continue to compete by leveraging our formulation and manufacturing expertise, driving product innovation, building differentiated brand equity and focusing on in-store visibility. 
 The global men s skin care market is expected to continue to grow, with increased demand for men s personal care products. Our competitors in this market include large companies such as Kenvue, L Or al S.A., The Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. and Unilever, and numerous other smaller companies. We compete in the market by creating simple and effective skin care products with natural ingredients at multiple price points through our Bulldog and Cremo skin care products and in the luxury men s skin care market with Jack Black. 
 
 Feminine Care 
 The markets for feminine care and other personal products are characterized by large manufacturers with global presence, as well as new market entrants, and is likewise very competitive, with a large number of domestic and foreign competitors, including The Procter Gamble Company and Kimberly Clark Corp. With our acquisition of the Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. brands, we expanded our presence within the feminine care product category and became one of the top three manufacturers in North America. We compete by having a portfolio of well-known brands that address complementary consumer needs. 
 
 Sales and Distribution 
 Our products are marketed primarily through a direct sales force and supplemented by strategic exclusive and non-exclusive distributors and wholesalers. In the U.S., Japan, China, Australia and larger markets in Western Europe and Latin America, we have dedicated commercial organizations, reflecting the scale and importance of these businesses to our Company. In several countries where we do not have dedicated commercial organizations, we utilize third-party distributors and wholesalers. As a result of increased competition through the expansion of online markets, we have established e-commerce operations across several business lines, including global Schick.com websites providing men s and women s shaving products, Bulldog, Jack Black and Billie DTC sites, and an acceleration of e-commerce sales in China through our partnership with T-Mall. We distribute our products to consumers through numerous retail locations worldwide, including mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, food, drug and convenience stores, and military stores, and both traditional and modern trade customers outside of the United States. 
 5 

Although a large percentage of our sales are attributable to a relatively small number of retail customers, only Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries Walmart ), as a group, account for more than 10 of our consolidated annual net sales. Walmart accounted for approximately 17.2 of our net sales in fiscal 2024. Purchases by Walmart included products from all of our segments. Target Corporation represented approximately 9.5 of net sales for our Sun and Skin Care segment and 9.8 for our Feminine Care segment, respectively. 
 Generally, orders are shipped within a month of their order date. Because of the short period of time between order and shipment dates, the dollar amount of current backlog is not material and is not considered to be a reliable indicator of future sales volume. 
 Government contracts do not represent a material portion of our net sales. 
 Seasonality 
 Customer orders for Sun Care products within our Sun and Skin Care segment are highly seasonal, which has historically resulted in higher sun care sales to retailers in the United States during the late winter through mid-summer months. Within our Wet Shave segment, sales of women s products are moderately seasonal, with increased consumer demand in the spring and summer months. See Our business is subject to seasonal volatility in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
 The principal raw materials used in our products include steel, various plastic resins, plastic based components, textile fibers and non-woven fabrics, organic and inorganic chemicals, soap-based lubricants and plastic-pulp based packaging. These materials are sourced on a regional or global basis, as applicable, and are mostly available from multiple sources. Price and availability of our raw materials fluctuate over time. While we have confidence our supply assurance plans adequately support our current operational needs, we cannot predict the future with certainty. Both price and supply are subject to risk from global socio- and macroeconomic influences such as, but not limited to, force majeure, loss or impairment to key manufacturing sites, transportation, government regulation, currency or other unforeseen circumstances. In the past, we have largely avoided significant interruption in the availability of our input materials and believe that our extensive experience and global reach in procurement will continue to allow us to manage these risks effectively. 
 Patents, Technology and Trademarks 
 We own a number of U.S. and international trademarks, which we consider of substantial importance, and which are used individually or in conjunction with our other trademarks. These include, but are not limited to: Edgewell , Schick, Schick Hydro, Schick Hydro Silk, Hydro Connect , Wilkinson Sword, Intuition, Quattro, Xtreme 3, Billie, Protector , Silk Effects, Slim Twin, Edge, Skintimate, Personna, Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic, Bulldog, Jack Black, Cremo, Gentle Glide, Sport, Sport Level Protection , Wet Ones, Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. As a result of the Playtex acquisition, we also own royalty-free licenses in perpetuity to the Playtex trademark in the U.S. and in many international jurisdictions related to certain feminine hygiene and other products but excluding certain baby care and apparel-related products. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business. 
 Our ability to compete effectively in the Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care, and Feminine Care personal care segments depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of technology and manufacturing processes through a combination of patent and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and licensing agreements. We own or license a considerable number of patents, patent applications and other technology from third parties, which we believe are important to our business. These relate primarily to shaving product improvements and additional features, feminine care hygiene products including digital and applicator tampons, pads and liners, sunscreen formulations and manufacturing processes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned, either directly or beneficially, 301 unexpired U.S. patents, which have a range of expiration dates from October 2024 to February 2040, and we had 73 pending U.S. patent applications. We routinely prepare additional patent applications for filing in the U.S. and actively pursue foreign patent protection in various countries. As of September 30, 2024, we owned, either directly or beneficially, 1,220 foreign patents, having a range of expiration dates from October 2024 to August 2049, and we had 145 pending patent applications in foreign countries. 
 We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights from others. 
 6 

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations by governmental agencies intended to protect the public health and environment, including those governing the manufacture, use, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, labeling and notice requirements related to consumer exposure to certain chemicals, and requirements for the recycling of our products and their packaging. These agencies include, but are not limited to (i) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA and equivalent international agencies that regulate ingredients in consumer products; (ii) the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities; and (iii) the Chemical Registration/Notification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in, or transport to, the various countries in which we manufacture and/or market our products. We have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries, such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals REACH regulations in the European Union (the E.U. ), which may impact our products. 
 Contamination has been identified at certain of our current and former facilities, as well as third-party waste disposal sites, and we are conducting investigation and remediation activities in relation to such properties. In connection with certain sites, we have received past notices from the EPA, state agencies and private parties seeking contribution that we have been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA and, as a result, we may be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to a number of federal Superfund sites. In addition to potential costs to clean up our own properties, we may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites and certain international locations. 
 The amount of our ultimate liability in connection with those sites may depend on many factors, including the volume and toxicity of material contributed to the site, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the remediation methods and technology to be used. Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses from known environmental liabilities are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our total capital and operating expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans or our understanding of the underlying facts, changes in legal requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change or other factors. 
 The U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 TSCA and similar laws in other jurisdictions are intended to ensure that chemicals do not pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment. TSCA requires the EPA to maintain the TSCA registry listing chemicals manufactured or processed in the United States. Chemicals not listed on the TSCA registry cannot be imported into or sold in the U.S. until registered with the EPA. TSCA also sets forth specific reporting, recordkeeping and testing rules for chemicals, including requirements for the import and export of certain chemicals, as well as other restrictions relevant to our business. Pursuant to these laws, the EPA from time to time issues Significant New Use Rules, or SNURs, when it identifies new uses of chemicals that could pose risks to human health or the environment and also requires pre-manufacture notification of new chemical substances that do not appear on the TSCA registry. When we import chemicals into the U.S., we must ensure that chemicals appear on the TSCA registry prior to import, participate in the SNUR process when a chemical we import requires testing data and report to the EPA information relating to quantities, identities and uses of imported chemicals. 
 Many European countries, as well as the E.U., have been very active in adopting and enforcing environmental regulations. As such, it is possible that new regulations may increase the risk and expense of doing business in such countries. 
 REACH requires manufacturers and importers of chemical substances to register such substances with the European Chemicals Agency, (the ECHA ), and enables European and national authorities to track such substances. Depending on the amount of chemical substances to be manufactured or imported, and the specific risks of each substance, REACH requires different sets of data to be included in the registration submitted to the ECHA. Registration of substances with the ECHA imposes significant recordkeeping requirements that can result in significant financial obligations for companies such as ours to import products into Europe. REACH is accompanied by legislation regulating the classification, labeling and packaging of chemical substances and mixtures. 
 We believe that our facilities and products are in substantial compliance with current applicable laws and regulations. 
 Sustainability 
 Edgewell s Sustainable Care 2030 strategy provides a roadmap for delivering on our ambitions and guides us to be a successful and responsible business not just today, but for generations to come. 
 Unveiled in 2020, our Sustainable Care 2030 strategy includes clear targets across our brands, operations and supply chain, as well as our workforce and communities. These 2030 targets include (i) 100 renewable electricity use and carbon neutrality across our global operations; (ii) reducing use of virgin petroleum-based plastic content packaging and select products; (iii) using 100 recyclable, compostable or reusable plastic packaging; and (iv) pursuing zero waste to landfills across manufacturing facilities. We also regularly review our key sustainability priority areas to keep them relevant to our business 
 7 

today and a changing sustainability landscape. Our priority areas are defined by where we believe we can have the greatest impact, as well as the areas that might most meaningfully impact our business. 
 We are making progress on our goals, including in priority areas such as sustainable products and packaging, ingredient stewardship, responsible sourcing, reducing waste, protecting the health and safety of our teammates, and embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion across the organization, among others. However, there is no guarantee that we will achieve all of our sustainability priorities on or before 2030 as our progress towards these priorities may be impacted by various factors beyond our control. 
 Sustainability related disclosures included in this Annual Report, our Proxy Statement and our sustainability reports are informed by standards and guidelines such as the Global Reporting Initiative GRI and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD ). The materiality thresholds in those standards and guidelines may differ from the concept of materiality for purposes of the federal securities laws and disclosures required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Human Capital 
 Employee Profile 
 At Edgewell, we are committed first and foremost to people: our employees, the consumers who use our products, the suppliers and retailers who partner with us, and the communities in which we operate. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 6,700 employees, with 2,100 based in the United States. Certain of our employees outside of the U.S. are represented by unions or works councils. We have cultivated a culture that is centered around our guiding purpose of Making Useful Things Joyful, supported by a set of values and behaviors that guide organizational actions and decisions. 
 We believe our foundational values of People First, Move Forward, Listen Up and Speak Up and Own It Together support a culture of celebration, agility, authenticity, inclusion and collaboration. This culture promotes trust and teamwork, which results in bold and aggressive goals, smart risks, and an environment where innovation and ideation thrive. We continue to reinforce these foundational values through several key initiatives such as our performance management process which incorporates a 360-degree Values Assessment that evaluates each employee s performance not only on the results achieved, but on how they achieve them and an internal global recognition and service anniversary platform. As recognition of the progress we ve made in living our foundational values, we have received notable recognition in the following ways:

Safety 
 We believe that developing and maintaining a strong safety culture is one of the major keys to our continued success. Additionally, facilities have continued an existing machine safety program and assessment initiative, including completing any remaining assessments and implementing fixes for identified items. Finally, our manufacturing sites have revitalized their Alive and Well program and initiatives over the last year with some facilities rolling the program out to other levels in their organization. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 We remain committed to creating a work environment where every individual feels respected, connected, valued, and empowered. We recruit the best people for the job regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other protected traits and it is our policy to comply fully with all domestic, foreign, and local laws relating to discrimination in the workplace.

Our website address is www.edgewell.com. We are not including the information contained on our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this filing. We make available to the public on our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Accordingly, investors should monitor our website in addition to our SEC filings and public webcasts. These items are available at www.edgewell.com under Investors/News and Events. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 The following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time in other reports we file with the SEC. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions and Related Risk Factors 
 Changes in production costs, including raw material prices and tariffs, could erode our profit margins and negatively impact operating results. 
 Pricing and availability of raw materials, energy, shipping, labor and other services needed for our business can be volatile due to general economic conditions, including inflation, supplier capacity restraints, geopolitical developments, changes in supply and demand, natural disasters, energy costs, health epidemics or pandemics, labor shortages and turnover, production levels, currency fluctuations, governmental actions (including import and export requirements such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port congestions or delays, transport capacity restraints, cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions of key manufacturing sites, acts of terrorism and other factors beyond our control. There is no certainty that we will be able to offset future cost increases. This volatility can significantly affect our production costs and may, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 If such cost pressures persist or exceed our estimates and we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. In addition, even if we increase the prices of our products in response to increases in the cost of commodities or other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain such price increases. Sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may reduce consumption due to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales and market share declines. Our projections may not accurately predict the potential negative volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may not be able to attract, retain and develop key personnel. 
 Our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain and motivate our key employees or attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. 
 Competition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, achieve profitability, or maintain relationships with existing customers. 
 The categories in which we operate are largely mature and highly competitive, both in the U.S. and globally, as a number of companies compete for consumer acceptance, limited retail shelf space and e-commerce opportunities. Because of the highly competitive environment in which we operate, as well as increasing omni-channel retailer concentration, our customers, frequently seek to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms, resulting in either reduction of our gross margins or losses of distribution to lower cost competitors. Competition is based upon brand perceptions, product performance and innovation, customer service and price. Our ability to compete effectively may be affected by a number of factors, including: 
 several of our competitors, including The Procter Gamble Company, Unilever, Kenvue and others, may have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources and greater market share in certain segments than we do, which could provide them with greater scale and negotiating leverage with retailers and suppliers; 
 our competitors may have lower production, sales and distribution costs, and higher profit margins, which may enable them to offer aggressive retail discounts and other promotional incentives; 
 11 

our competitors may be able to obtain exclusive distribution rights at particular retailers or favorable in-store placement; 
 our retailers could reduce inventories, shift to different products, or require us to lower our prices to retain shelf placement of our products; and 
 we may lose market share to private label brands sold by retail chains, or to price brands sold by local and regional competitors, which, in each case, are typically sold at lower prices than our products. 
 
 Legal, Regulatory, Tax and Other Risks 
 Our business is subject to increasing global regulation, including product related regulations and environmental regulations, that may expose us to significant liabilities. 
 The manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, advertising and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation. For example, a number of our products are regulated by health authorities both in the U.S. and in the E.U. (such as the U.S. FDA), and by consumer protection organizations (such as the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission). These regulatory frameworks focus on our ingredients as well as the safety and efficacy of our products. Similarly, the advertising and marketing of our products is regulated by agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. All of these regulatory frameworks exist at the federal, state and local level in the U.S. as well as in foreign countries where we sell our products. New or more restrictive regulations or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations are likely and could lead to additional compliance costs and could have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, a finding that we are in violation of, or not in compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to material civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is not merited or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions could jeopardize our reputation and brand image and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation. 
 We must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances. A release of such substances due to an accident or intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, we could be subject to joint and several strict liability for contamination relating to our or our predecessors current or former properties or any of their respective third-party waste disposal sites. In addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs, any such contamination can give rise to claims from governmental authorities or other third parties for natural resource damage, personal injury, property damage or other liabilities. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including remediation costs relating to our current and former properties and third-party waste disposal sites. As new laws and regulations are introduced, we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Our Company may be named a party to legal proceedings or may be subject to product liability or other claims that can result in significant expenses, fines, product recalls or withdrawals and reputational damage, which would affect our results of operations and financial condition. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, current and historical product liability claims; claims that our product manufacturing, sales, and marketing practices violate various consumer protection laws both in the U.S. and internationally; and claims arising out of alleged defects in our products, including property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. In addition to the risk of monetary judgments not covered by insurance, product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our products reputation and in certain cases require a product recall. Product recalls or product liability claims, and any subsequent remedial actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand value, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Litigation, in general, and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include large numbers of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. Although we maintain product liability insurance, this insurance does not cover all types of claims, particularly claims other than those involving personal injury or property damage or claims that exceed the amount of insurance coverage. Further, we may not be able to maintain such insurance in sufficient amounts, on desirable terms, or at all, in the future. 
 
 12 

Our business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. 
 There is increased focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. From time to time, we announce certain initiatives, including goals, regarding our focus areas, which include environmental matters, packaging, responsible sourcing, social investments and diversity, equity and inclusion. We could fail, or be perceived to have failed, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. Such failures could be due to changes in our business (e.g., shifts in business among distribution channels or acquisitions). Moreover, the standards by which citizenship and sustainability efforts and related matters are measured are evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions which could change over time. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Adverse incidents related to corporate citizenship or sustainability matters could impact the value of our brands, the cost of our operations, and our relationships with existing and future investors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on sustainability. If, as a result of their assessment of our sustainability practices, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company. At the same time, there also exists anti-ESG sentiment among certain stakeholders and government institutions, and we may face scrutiny, reputational risk, product boycotts, lawsuits or market access restrictions from these parties regarding our sustainability initiatives. 
 
 Increasing focus on sustainability matters has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, evolving legal and regulatory requirements, including mandatory due diligence, disclosure and reporting requirements, as well as a variety of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards. We have incurred, and are likely to continue to incur, increased costs complying with such standards and regulations, particularly given the lack of convergence among standards. In addition, our processes and controls may not always comply with evolving standards and regulations for identifying, measuring and reporting sustainability metrics; our interpretation of reporting standards and regulations may differ from those of others; and such standards and regulations may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. In addition, methodologies for reporting our data may be updated and previously reported data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations (including from acquisitions and divestitures), and other changes in circumstances. Any failure or perceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill our sustainability goals and aspirations or to satisfy various sustainability reporting standards or regulatory requirements within the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk of litigation or result in regulatory actions. 
 If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market similar products, which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations. 
 The vast majority of our total net sales are from products bearing proprietary trademarks and brand names. In addition, we own or license from third parties a considerable number of patents, patent applications and other technology. We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect or maintain our own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. In addition, even if such rights are protected in the U.S., the laws of some other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Our intellectual property rights could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future, and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights. As patents expire, we could face increased competition or decreased royalties, either of which could negatively impact our operating results. If other parties infringe our intellectual property rights, they may dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands which may harm our sales. 
 Legislative changes in applicable tax laws, policies and regulations or unfavorable resolution of tax matters may result in additional tax liabilities, which could adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations. 
 Our businesses are subject to taxation in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions. The impact of any legislative tax law, policy or regulation changes by federal, state, local and foreign authorities may result in additional tax liabilities which could adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations. Significant estimation and judgment are required in determining our provisions for taxes in the U.S. and jurisdictions outside the U.S. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and although we believe our tax positions are defensible and our tax provision estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. The unfavorable resolution of any audits or litigation could have an adverse impact on future operating results and our financial condition. More aggressive and assertive tax collection policies, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S., may 
 13 

increase the costs of resolving tax issues and enhance the likelihood that we will have increased tax liabilities going forward. In addition, international tax reform remains a priority with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s Action Plan on Base Erosion Profit Shifting and other proposed foreign jurisdictional tax law changes. Given the uncertainty of the possible changes and their potential interdependency, we are unable to determine the net consolidated impact of changes in global tax legislation, if any. 
 
 Information Technology and Systems 
 A failure of a key information technology system or a breach of our information security could adversely impact our ability to conduct business. 
 We rely extensively on information technology systems in order to conduct business, including some that are managed by third-party service providers. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to internal and external communications, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, and complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements. These information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to the poor performance or failure of third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events. If our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in conducting our business which may adversely impact our operating results. 
 Periodically, we also need to upgrade our information technology systems or adopt new technologies. If such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. Further, if the information technology systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results. 
 An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company s business or reputation. 
 Our systems and networks, as well as those of our retailer customers, suppliers, service providers, and banks, may become the target of advanced cyber-attacks or information security breaches which will pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data of our Company, employees, customers or consumers, and disrupt our operations or damage our facilities or those of third parties. As cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent globally, we are continually increasing our attention and efforts to these potential threats. We assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them, including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems, increasing specialized information security skills, deploying employee security training, and updating security policies for our Company and our third-party providers. However, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. As a result, a cyber-attack could negatively impact our net sales and increase our operating and capital costs. In addition, our employees frequently access our suppliers and customers systems and we may be liable if our employees are the source of any breaches in these third-party systems. It could also damage our reputation with retailer customers and consumers and diminish the strength and reputation of our brands or require us to pay monetary penalties.

Business and Operational Risk Factors 
 Loss of any of our principal customers could significantly decrease our sales and profitability. 
 Walmart, together with its subsidiaries, is our largest customer, accounting for 17.2 of our net sales in fiscal 2024. Generally, sales to our top customers are made pursuant to purchase orders and we do not have supply agreements or guarantees of minimum purchases from them. As a result, these customers may decrease their level of purchases from us at any time. The loss or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by any of our top customers would harm our sales and profitability. Increasing customer concentration could result in reduced sales outlets for our products, as well as greater negotiating pressures and pricing requirements. 
 Changes in the policies of our customers and increasing dependence on an omnichannel strategy in developed markets may adversely affect our business. 
 In recent years, an omnichannel strategy in both in the U.S. and internationally has gained increasing importance. This trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large, highly consolidated retail customers, including internet-based retailers, who may demand lower pricing, special packaging or impose other commercial requirements on us. These business demands may relate to inventory practices, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Some of our high-volume customers have sought to obtain pricing and other concessions and better trade terms. To the extent we provide concessions or better trade terms to those customers, our margins are reduced. Further, if we are unable to effectively respond to the demands of our customers, these customers could reduce their purchases of our products and increase their purchases of products from competitors, which would harm our sales and profitability. In addition, reductions in inventory by our customers, including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry, or our customers managing their working capital requirements, could result in reduced orders for our products and adversely affect our results of operations for the financial periods affected by such reductions. 
 Protracted unfavorable market conditions have caused many of our customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell, which could lead to the retailer reducing or discontinuing certain of our product lines, particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category. 
 We face risks arising from our ongoing efforts to achieve cost savings. 
 In the normal course of business, we may initiate projects which change our manufacturing footprint or our operations in order to gain production and distribution efficiencies and reduce costs. The execution of cost savings initiatives may present a number of significant risks, including: 
 actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service standards to customers; 
 the failure to preserve adequate internal controls as we restructure our general and administrative functions, including our information technology and financial reporting infrastructure; 
 the failure to preserve supplier relationships and distribution, sales and other important relationships and to resolve conflicts that may arise; 
 loss of sales as we reduce or eliminate staffing on non-core product lines; 
 diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities; 
 the failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees while implementing benefit changes and reductions in the workforce; and 
 identification and implementation of potential synergies in our manufacturing footprint 
 Because of these and other factors, we cannot predict whether we will realize the anticipated benefits of these initiatives and, if we do not, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 We are subject to risks related to our international operations, including currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We conduct business on a global basis, with nearly 44 of our net sales in fiscal 2024 originating outside the U.S., and a significant portion of our production capacity and cash are located overseas. Consequently, we are subject to a number of risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, including: 
 sourcing of raw materials from around the world; 
 reliance on China to source, assemble, and transport materials and goods; 
 15 

delays in transportation of goods when shipping globally; 
 economic conditions impact availability and capacity of key vendors; 
 the possibility of expropriation, confiscatory taxation or price controls; 
 the ability to repatriate foreign-based cash effectively for strategic needs in the U.S., as well as the heightened counterparty, internal control and country-specific risks associated with holding cash overseas; 
 the effect of foreign income taxes, value-added taxes and withholding taxes, including the inability to recover amounts owed to us by a government authority without extended proceedings or at all; 
 the effect of the U.S. tax treatment of foreign source income and losses, and other restrictions on the flow of capital between countries; 
 adverse changes in local investment or exchange control regulations; 
 restrictions on and taxation of international imports and exports; 
 legal and regulatory constraints, including tariffs and other trade barriers; 
 currency fluctuations, including the impact of hyper-inflationary conditions, particularly where exchange controls limit or eliminate our ability to convert from local currency; 
 political or economic instability, government nationalization of business or industries, government corruption and civil unrest, including political or economic instability; and 
 difficulty in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights. 
 One or more of these factors could harm our international operations or investments and our operating results. 
 We are currently dependent on third party manufacturers to manufacture certain products for our business. Our business could suffer as a result of a third-party manufacturer s inability to produce our products for us on time or to our specifications. 
 There is also a possibility that third-party manufacturers, which produce a portion of our products, could discontinue production with little or no advance notice, or experience financial problems or problems with product quality or timeliness of product delivery, resulting in manufacturing delays or disruptions, regulatory sanctions, product liability claims or consumer complaints. The inability of a third-party manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner, in desirable quantities or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business. While certain of our relationships with these third parties are subject to minimum volume commitments, whereby the third-party manufacturer has committed to produce and we have committed to purchase a minimum quantity of product, we may nonetheless experience situations where such manufacturers are unable to fulfill their obligations under our agreements. 
 Our manufacturing facilities, supply channels or other business operations may be subject to disruption from events beyond our control and we may be unable to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities at current and any future manufacturing locations. 
 Operations of our manufacturing and packaging facilities worldwide, and of our corporate offices, and the methods we use to obtain supplies and to distribute our products, may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including availability of raw materials, work stoppages, industrial accidents, disruptions in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality or safety issues, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, trade disputes between countries in which we have operations, and acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, hurricanes, flooding or other natural disasters. The supply of our raw materials may be similarly disrupted. If a major disruption were to occur, it could result in delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations. We maintain business interruption insurance to potentially mitigate the impact of business interruption, but such coverage may not be sufficient to offset the financial or reputational impact of an interruption. 
 Likewise, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities at current and any future manufacturing locations. Failure to do so may impact our brands, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 
 Loss of reputation of our leading brands or failure of our marketing plans could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 We depend on the continuing reputation and success of our brands, particularly the Schick, Wilkinson Sword, Billie, Edge, Skintimate, Playtex, Wet Ones, Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic, Bulldog, Cremo, Jack Black, Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. brands. 
 16 

Our operating results could be adversely affected if one of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. Further, the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or new product offerings do not improve or have a negative impact on our brands image or ability to attract and retain consumers. Additionally, if claims made in our marketing campaigns become subject to litigation alleging false advertising, it could damage one or several of our brands, cause us to alter our marketing plans in ways that may materially and adversely affect sales, or result in the imposition of significant damages against us. Further, a boycott or other campaign critical of us, through social media or otherwise, could negatively impact our brands reputation and, consequently, our products sales. 
 Our business is subject to seasonal volatility. 
 Customer orders for sun care products within our Sun and Skin Care segment are highly seasonal, which has historically resulted in higher sun care sales to retailers during the late winter through mid-summer months. Accordingly, our sales, financial performance, working capital requirements and cash flow may experience volatility during these periods. Further, purchases of our sun care products can be significantly impacted by unfavorable weather conditions during the summer period, and as a result we may suffer decreases in net sales if conditions are not favorable for use of our products, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Within our Wet Shave segment, sales of women s products are moderately seasonal, with increased consumer demand in the spring and summer months. 
 Our financial performance depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to consumer trends and changes in consumer preferences. New product introductions may not be as successful as we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 We have a rigorous process for the continuous development and evaluation of new product concepts, led by executives in marketing, sales, research and development, product development, operations, legal and finance. However, consumer preference and spending patterns change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that we will anticipate and respond to trends for consumer products effectively. Each new product launch, including those resulting from our product development process, carries risks, as well as the possibility of unexpected consequences, including: 
 the acceptance of our new product launches and sales of such new products may not be as high as we anticipate; 
 our marketing, promotional, advertising and/or pricing strategies for our new products may be less effective than planned and may fail to effectively reach the targeted consumer base or engender the desired consumption of the products by consumers; 
 we may incur costs exceeding our expectations as a result of the continued development and launch of new products, including, for example, unanticipated levels of research and development costs, advertising, promotional and/or marketing expenses, sales return expenses or other costs related to launching new products; 
 we may experience a decrease in sales of certain of our existing products as a result of newly-launched products, the impact of which could be exacerbated by shelf space limitations and/or any shelf space loss; 
 our product pricing strategies for new product launches may not be accepted by customers and/or consumers, which may result in sales being less than we anticipate; and/or 
 we may experience a decrease in sales of certain of our products as a result of counterfeit products and/or products sold outside of their intended territories. 
 Each of the risks referred to above could delay or impede our ability to achieve our sales objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 Impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets would result in a reduction in net income. 
 We have a material amount of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets, as well as other long-lived assets, which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards. Declines in our profitability and estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets, as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates, may result in an impairment charge, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. 
 Our access to capital markets and borrowing capacity could be limited. 
 Our access to capital markets to raise funds through the sale of debt or equity securities is subject to various factors, including general economic and financial market conditions. A significant reduction in market liquidity and general economic conditions 
 17 

could impact access to funding and increase associated borrowing costs, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows. Additionally, disruptions in financial markets could reduce our access to debt and equity capital markets, negatively affecting our ability to implement our business plan and strategy. 
 Our access to debt financing at competitive risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our credit ratings. The major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have assigned us credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include our financial strength and financial policies as well as our strategies, operations and execution. A downgrade to our credit ratings could have a material impact on our business, including increasing our interest rates, limiting our access to public debt markets, limiting the institutions willing to provide us credit facilities, more restrictive credit arrangements and making any future credit facilities or credit facility amendments more costly and difficult to obtain. 
 We have a substantial level of indebtedness and are subject to various covenants relating to such indebtedness, which could limit our discretion to operate and grow our business. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our debt level was 1.3 billion. We may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash to debt service, thereby reducing funds available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes. Our failure to make scheduled interest payments or to repay or refinance the indebtedness at maturity or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business. Approximately 1.3 billion (98 of our debt balance as of September 30, 2024, is borrowed at fixed interest rates ranging from 4.125 to 5.50 with maturity dates in 2028 and thereafter. 
 Additionally, certain of our debt instruments are subject to certain financial and other covenants, including debt ratio tests. We may be in breach of such covenants in the event of future declines in our operating cash flows or earnings performance, foreign currency movements or other events. In the event of such breach, our lenders may be entitled to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-default provision applies, and we could be required to seek amendments or waivers under the debt instruments or to refinance the debt. There is no assurance that we would obtain such amendments or waivers or effect such refinancing, or that we would be able to do so on terms similar to those of our current debt instruments. The covenants and financial ratio requirements contained in our debt instruments could also: 
 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness; 
 reduce the cash flow available or limit our ability to borrow additional funds, to pay dividends, to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to pursue our business strategies; 
 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate; and 
 place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have greater financial flexibility or limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. 
 Our Revolving Credit Facility (See Liquidity and Capital Resources for details) contains customary representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on additional indebtedness, dividends, and other distributions, entry into new lines of business, use of loan proceeds, restrictions on liens on the assets of the Company and our subsidiaries, transactions with affiliates and dispositions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility, as defined below. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default that include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, failure to make payment on, or defaults with respect to, certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments and change of control provisions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, and after the expiration of any applicable grace period, payment of any outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility could be accelerated and the lenders thereunder could foreclose on their security interests in the assets of the Company and certain of our subsidiaries. 
 We may not be able to effectively integrate acquired companies to achieve desired financial benefits. 
 We have completed a number of acquisitions, and we expect to continue making acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise. Acquisitions could be a key use of our cash and a potential driver of future sales and profit growth. If we can complete future acquisitions, we may face challenges in consolidating functions and effectively integrating procedures, personnel, product lines, and operations in a timely and efficient manner. The integration process can be complex and time consuming, may be disruptive to our existing and acquired businesses and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the business. Even if we can successfully complete the integration of acquired businesses into our operations, there is no assurance that anticipated cost savings, synergies, or revenue enhancements will be realized within the expected time frame, or at all. Such acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of additional 
 18 

debt, restructuring charges, impairment charges, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses related to our pension plans. 
 The Company has several defined benefit pension plans covering employees in the U.S. and certain employees in other countries. The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, interest rates and governmental regulations. While the pension benefit earned to date by active participants under our legacy U.S. pension plan was frozen effective January 1, 2014, and retirement service benefits no longer accrue under this retirement program, and in 2023, under our Canadian defined benefit pension plan, we derecognized the assets and projected benefit obligation, our pension obligations are expected to remain significant. If the investment of plan assets does not provide the expected long-term returns, if interest rates or other assumptions change, or if governmental regulations change the timing or amounts of required contributions to the plans, we could be required to make additional pension contributions which may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, our ability to comply with debt covenants and may require recognition of increased expense within our financial statements.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity. 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 We have a cybersecurity program to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. This includes multiple tools and processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. 
 Our efforts are designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information and operational technology systems and the data stored on those systems. The program includes: 
 Conduct periodic risk assessments to identify cybersecurity risks in our IT systems 
 Monitor for external threats and manage incident response 
 Engage third-party security providers for penetration testing and program reviews based on National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST standards 
 Perform internal audit reviews of IT-related controls 
 Assess cybersecurity risks of third-party vendors 
 Train employees regularly, including phishing simulations 
 The cyber security program is continually adapting to the evolving threat landscape and technology developments. 
 A multi-functional enterprise cyber security and Infrastructure team reviews and assesses top cybersecurity risks. This assessment is shared with members of senior management, including the CFO and Senior Vice President SVP ), IT, and helps guide the Company's cybersecurity operational priorities and strategy. In addition, cybersecurity risks are integrated into the Company s broader Enterprise Risk Management program and, when identified, are reported to relevant business and governance leaders within the Company for appropriate action. 
 To support the ongoing identification and management of cybersecurity issues, the Company provides information security employee training, conducts global and targeted phishing simulation campaigns and conducts tabletop exercises. The Company also deploys a combination of security tools and experts to help prevent, detect, contain, eradicate and recover from potential cybersecurity issues and cyber-attacks. Further, the Company engages third-party consultants and services for cyber threat intelligence, insights and assessments of its cybersecurity risk posture and governance. 
 The Company s third-party intake process incorporates cybersecurity risk into the assessment of our third-party vendors when we engage a new vendor or experience a change in relationship with an existing vendor. Further, the Company s cybersecurity team conducts reviews of its third-party vendors depending on the vendor s risk profile as determined by its cybersecurity team. 
 As a global company, we manage a variety of cybersecurity threats and cannot wholly eliminate the risk of adverse impacts from such incidents. However, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we have not identified any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of our operations or financial condition. For additional information on the risks from cybersecurity threats that we have faced in the past and expect to continue to face in the future, please refer to the Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
 19 

Security Policy and Requirements 
 As part of our overall risk management program, we have adopted our Information Security Policy which details the overall risk-based framework and governance for the management and security of our information technology assets and information. The policy applies to everyone who accesses our data or information resources and all of our information systems and resources, including third parties we engage. Our program aligns with the NIST 2.0 cybersecurity framework. 
 Governance 
 Our Board of Directors are part of the Company s Cyber Response Task Force and table top simulations. Additionally, the Board of Directors have delegated to the Audit Committee oversight responsibility of our risk management program, including cybersecurity, business continuity, IT operational resilience, and data privacy. The Audit Committee has specific responsibility for reviewing the status of the security of the Company s electronic data processing information systems related to the Company s people, assets and information systems. The Audit Committee receives regular updates from the SVP, IT, about information security and systems security programs and plans, including emerging trends and progress on overall enterprise cybersecurity programs and priorities. These updates occur at least two times a year, with interim updates as needed. Additionally, we have protocols by which certain cybersecurity incidents are reported promptly to the Chief Executive Officer, or the Audit Committee, as appropriate. A Cyber dashboard is also provided to the Board of Directors quarterly. 
 Management is responsible for implementing its strategic plans, including identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating the risks inherent in them, such as cybersecurity risks. 
 Internal Cybersecurity Team 
 The Information Security organization reports into the SVP, IT and includes a dedicated team of centralized information security experts with extensive cybersecurity knowledge and experience to manage the cyber risk under the leadership of the Director of Information Security. 
 The team is responsible for the following: 
 Implementing Enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy 
 Developing and enforcing Cybersecurity Policy 
 Developing and enforcing Cybersecurity Standards 
 Approving and reviewing Cybersecurity Architecture 
 Developing and enforcing Cybersecurity Processes 
 Developing and testing Cybersecurity Incident response 
 Performing other Cybersecurity operational activities including but not limited to: 
 Vulnerability management strategy 
 Network security configurations 
 Risk Management and oversight of third parties 
 Incident Response 
 We have adopted a cybersecurity incident response plan that is designed to provide a framework across all functions for a coordinated identification and response to security incidents. The plan specifies the process for identifying, validating, classifying, documenting, and responding to cybersecurity events as well as determining whether reporting of an event is appropriate under regulatory standards. Internal reporting and escalation protocols are in place to ensure the involvement of the SVP, IT, other senior leaders, and the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Under the plan, we conduct tabletop exercises to test our preparedness and our incident response process, and we provide ongoing training. 
 Risk Factors 
 As a global company serving customers in multiple countries and territories, we routinely experience a wide variety of cybersecurity incidents. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have not experienced a cybersecurity incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operation or financial condition. Additional information on cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors, which should be read in conjunction with the information in this section.

Item 2. Properties. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned or leased 55 properties, 29 in the U.S. and 26 globally. Eleven of these properties are used as production plants consisting of 1.8 million square feet that is owned and 1.3 million square feet that is leased. Five of these plants are located in the U.S., and six are in other countries. Seven of these plants are used exclusively by our Wet Shave segment, one by our Feminine Care segment, two by our Sun and Skin Care segment and one is shared by our Wet Shave and Sun and Skin Care segments. We also have 15 warehouses consisting of 0.1 million square feet that is owned and 0.8 million square feet that is leased. We operate from 29 different offices throughout the world, totaling 0.6 million square feet, all of which are leased, and includes our corporate headquarters in Shelton, Connecticut. We believe all of our facilities are well-maintained and suitable for the operations conducted in them. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 We, and our subsidiaries, are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of our operations during the ordinary course of business. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. We review our legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies when the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, we believe that our liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims, which are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 (in millions, except per share data) 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 While we report financial results in accordance with GAAP, this discussion also includes non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted or organic and exclude items which are considered by the Company as unusual or non-recurring, and which may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Company s financial results in any particular period. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included within this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 This non-GAAP information is provided as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use this non-GAAP information internally to make operating decisions and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of ongoing operating results. Given certain significant events, we view the use of non-GAAP measures that take into account the impact of these unique events as particularly valuable in understanding our underlying operational results and providing insights into future performance. The information can also be used to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by the types of items that are excluded. This non-GAAP information is also a component in determining management s incentive compensation. Finally, we believe this information provides more transparency. 
 The following provides additional detail on our non-GAAP measures for the periods presented: 
 We analyze net sales and segment profit on an organic basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Organic net sales and organic segment profit exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency translation. 
 Segment profit will be impacted by fluctuations in translation and transactional foreign currency. The impact of currency was applied to segments using management s best estimate. 
 Additionally, we utilize adjusted non-GAAP measures, including adjusted gross margin, adjusted selling general and administrative SG A ), adjusted operating income, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share internally to make operating decisions. 
 All comparisons are with the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted . 
 24 

Executive Summary 
 The following is a summary of key results for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share EPS for the time periods presented were impacted by certain costs or income, as described in the table below. The impact of these items on reported net earnings and EPS are provided as a reconciliation of net earnings and EPS to adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS, both of which are non-GAAP measures. 
 Fiscal 2024 
 Net sales in fiscal 2024 increased 2.1, or 0.1 , to 2,253.7, including a 2.2, or 0.1 , unfavorable impact due to currency movements. Organic net sales increased 4.3, or 0.2 , as 7.3 growth in international markets, reflecting both increased volumes and price, was partially offset by a 3.8 decrease in North America organic net sales, primarily reflecting volume declines in Feminine Care, Wet Shave and Wet Ones, partially offset by organic growth across Sun Care and Grooming. 
 Net earnings for fiscal 2024 decreased 16.1, or 14.0 , to 98.6. On an adjusted basis, net earnings for fiscal 2024 increased 13.8 to 153.0 . Adjusted net earnings increased primarily due to higher gross margin.

 Operating Results 
 The following table presents changes in net sales for fiscal 2024 and 2023 and provides a reconciliation of organic net sales to reported amounts. 
 Net Sales 
 Net Sales - Total Company For the Years Ended September 30, 2024 Chg 2023 Chg Net sales - prior year 2,251.6 2,171.7 Organic 4.3 0.2 94.0 4.3 Impact of Billie acquisition, net 12.0 0.6 Impact of currency (2.2) (0.1) (26.1) (1.2) Net sales - current year 2,253.7 0.1 2,251.6 3.7 
 For fiscal 2024, net sales were 2,253.7, an increase of 2.1, or 0.1 , including a 2.2, or 0.1 , unfavorable impact due to currency movements. Organic net sales increased 4.3, or 0.2 , as 7.3 growth in international markets, reflecting both increased volumes and price, was partially offset by a 3.8 decrease in North America organic net sales, primarily reflecting volume declines in Feminine Care, Wet Shave and Wet Ones, partially offset by organic growth across Sun Care and Grooming. 
 For further discussion regarding net sales, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, see Segment Results. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit was 955.7 in fiscal 2024, as compared to 940.8 in fiscal 2023, an increase of 14.9, or 1.6 . Gross margin for fiscal 2024 was 42.4 of net sales compared to 41.8 in the prior year period. Adjusted gross margin increased 140-basis points, as productivity savings of approximately 280-basis points and favorable price of approximately 115-basis points, more than offset core inflation and transitory cost headwinds related to unfavorable absorption and heightened unit cost inflation trapped in inventory of approximately 185-basis points, and unfavorable mix of approximately 70-basis points. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 SG A was 430.1, or 19.1 , of net sales in fiscal 2024 compared to 409.6, or 18.2 , of net sales in the prior year period. Adjusted SG A increased 40-basis points to 18.5 of net sales, primarily driven by higher people expenses, legal costs, and broker costs, partially offset by operational efficiency savings, lower bad debt expense and lower incentive compensation expense. 
 
 26 

Advertising and Sales Promotion Expense 
 For fiscal 2024, Advertising and Sales Promotion Expense A P was 232.0, up 2.9, or 1.3 , compared to fiscal 2023. A P was 10.3 of net sales for fiscal 2024, compared with 10.2 in fiscal 2023. The increase in A P was primarily due to incremental investment in Women s grooming and Sun Care, partially offset by Wet Shave. 
 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expense R D in fiscal 2024 was 58.4, a decrease of 0.1, or 0.2 , compared to 58.5 in the prior year. R D remained flat at 2.6 of net sales. 
 
 Restructuring Charges 
 We incurred 36.0 in restructuring charges in fiscal 2024, consisting largely of severance, project implementation and other exit costs. This includes a 15.6 restructuring charge related to certain operational and organizational steps designed to streamline the Company s operations and supply chain by consolidating its current Mexico operations in Obregon and Mexico City into a single facility in Aguascalientes, Mexico. We expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately 29 in fiscal 2025. 
 
 Interest Expense Associated with Debt 
 Interest expense associated with debt for fiscal 2024 was 76.5, a decrease of 2.0, or 2.5 , as compared to 78.5 in fiscal 2023. The decrease in interest expense was the result of a lower overall debt balance on the Company s Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by higher interest rates. 
 
 Other Expense (income), Net 
 Other expense (income), net was expense of 1.9 in fiscal 2024 compared to expense of 0.8 in fiscal 2023, which included currency hedge and remeasurement gains of 8.3 in fiscal 2024 compared to 12.7 in fiscal 2023. Current year expense reflects lower pension expense compared to the prior period, a loss on investment, and higher interest income. Prior year expense includes the loss on the settlement of the Canada defined benefit pension plan of 7.9. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 Income taxes, which include federal, state and foreign taxes, were 18.5 and 22.3 of Earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fiscal 2024 effective tax rate reflects a favorable mix of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and the impact of a change in the Company s prior estimates. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 was 20.3 compared to 23.0 in the prior year. 
 Our effective tax rate is highly sensitive to the mix of countries from which earnings or losses are derived. Declines in earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions, earnings increases in higher tax rate jurisdictions, or repatriation of foreign earnings or operating losses in the future could increase future tax rates. Additionally, adjustments to prior year tax provision estimates could increase or decrease future tax provisions.

Segment Results 
 Segment performance is evaluated based on segment profit, excluding certain U.S. GAAP items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing operating performance due to their unusual or non-recurring nature and which may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Company s financial results in any particular period. Financial items, such as interest income and expense, are managed on a global basis at the corporate level and therefore are excluded from segment profit. The exclusion of such charges from segment results reflects management s view on how management monitors and evaluates segment operating performance, generates future operating plans and makes strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. 
 Our operating model includes some shared business functions across segments, including product warehousing and distribution, transaction processing functions and, in most cases, a combined sales force and management teams. We apply a fully allocated cost basis in which shared business functions are allocated between segments. 
 The following tables present changes in segment net sales and segment profit for fiscal 2024 and 2023, and also provides a reconciliation of organic segment net sales and organic segment profit to reported amounts. For a reconciliation of Segment profit to Earnings before income taxes, see Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Organic net sales increased 3.0, or 0.2 , driven by a 7.3 increase in International organic sales, driven by both higher volumes and price. North America sales declined 7.2 , primarily due to lower volumes. North America sales were impacted by continued weak category and channel dynamics, particularly in the highly promotional drug channel, along with heightened competitive dynamics in Women s shave, as well as significant declines in Shave Preps and Disposables. 
 Segment Profit - Wet Shave For the Years Ended September 30, 2024 Chg 2023 Segment profit - prior year 158.3 174.5 Organic 47.4 29.9 9.3 5.3 Impact of currency (1.8) (1.1) (25.5) (14.6) Segment profit - current year 203.9 28.8 158.3 (9.3)

 Sun and Skin Care net sales for fiscal 2024 were 740.8, an increase of 35.3, or 5.0 . Organic net sales increased 32.8, or 4.6 , driven by Sun Care growth of 9.1 in International markets and 6.1 in North America, as well as 5.5 growth in global Grooming. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in Wet Ones primarily due to unfavorable volume impact related to a fire at our Sidney, Ohio manufacturing plant. 
 
 Segment Profit - Sun and Skin Care For the Years Ended September 30, 2024 Chg 2023 Chg Segment profit - prior year 137.4 108.8 Organic (7.3) (5.3) 28.7 26.4 Impact of currency 1.2 0.9 (0.1) (0.1) Segment profit - current year 131.3 (4.4) 137.4 26.3 
 Sun and Skin Care segment profit for fiscal 2024 was 131.3, a decrease of 6.1, or 4.4 . Organic segment profit decreased 7.3, or 5.3 , primarily driven by higher SG A and marketing expenses, partially offset by higher gross margins.

 During fiscal 2024, corporate expenses were 65.7, or 2.9 , of net sales, compared to 68.7, or 3.1 , of net sales in the prior year. The decrease in corporate expenses was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense, partially offset by higher people expenses. 
 During fiscal 2024 and 2023, we incurred 36.0 and 17.1, respectively, in restructuring and repositioning expenses, consisting largely of severance, project implementation and other exit costs. This includes a 15.6 charge in fiscal 2024 related to certain operational and organizational steps designed to streamline the Company s operations and supply chain by consolidating its current Mexico operations in Obregon and Mexico City into a single facility in Aguascalientes, Mexico. For further information, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 On December 1, 2023, a fire occurred at our Wet Ones manufacturing plant in Sidney, Ohio. There were no injuries reported and damage was limited to a single manufacturing process. As a consequence of the fire damage, there was a partial shutdown of the operations that manufacture Wet Ones raw materials. During fiscal 2024, we incurred 12.2 in incremental costs related to material charges, increased labor and absorption and other inefficiency costs as a result of the fire. 
 During fiscal 2024 we settled legal matters for certain class action advertising claims resulting in a charge of 3.9. During fiscal 2023 we settled a legal matter which resulted in a gain of 4.9 related to an intellectual property claim against a third party and also received a favorable court ruling regarding an international VAT matter which resulted in a gain of 2.2 from a release of the reserve previously established. For further information, see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 During fiscal 2024, we recorded a charge of 3.1 for a loss on investment associated with an equity method investment and related note receivable as a result of a new contractual agreement. 
 During fiscal 2023, the Company released a reserve of 1.7 related to certain accrued expenses associated with the write-off of inventory for certain Wet Ones SKUs. This charge was included in Cost of products sold in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. Also, during fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a charge of 7.9 related to the wind-up of its Canadian defined benefit pension plan. For further information see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash of 209.1, a significant portion of which was located outside the U.S. Given our extensive international operations, a significant portion of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the primary currencies to which the Company is exposed. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. We generally repatriate a portion of current year earnings from select non-U.S. subsidiaries only if the economic cost of the repatriation is not considered material. 
 Our cash is deposited with multiple counterparties which consist of major financial institutions. We consistently monitor positions with, and credit ratings of, counterparties both internally and by using outside ratings agencies. 
 Our total borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Interest Type Currency September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Long-term notes fixed USD 1,250.0 1,250.0 Revolver loans borrowed under credit facility variable USD 34.0 122.0 Short-term notes payable variable various 24.5 19.5 Total borrowings 1,308.5 1,391.5

 On April 2, 2024, (the Restatement Date ), the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a Restatement Agreement (the "Restatement Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and collateral agent ("BofA"), and the several lenders from time to time party thereto (together with BofA, the "Lenders"), which amended and restated the Company s Credit Agreement, dated as of March 28, 2020 (as previously amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement, dated as of February 6, 2023, and as otherwise amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified prior to the Restatement Date (the Credit Facility ). All of the 425.0 of revolving facility commitments under the Credit Facility (the Existing Revolving Facility Commitments were replaced with an equal amount of new revolving facility commitments (the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments , collectively, with the Existing Revolving Facility Commitments, the Revolving Credit Facility having substantially similar terms as the Existing Revolving Facility Commitments, except that the maturity date of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments will be the earlier of (i) April 2, 2029, and (ii) (a) March 2, 2028, if the aggregate outstanding amount of the Company s 5.500 Senior Notes due 2028 is greater than 150.0 as of such date and (b) December 29, 2028, if the aggregate outstanding amount of the Company s 4.125 Senior Notes due 2029 is greater than 150.0 of as such date, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for additional discussion. 
 On February 6, 2023, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility to transition from using the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as LIBOR is no longer available as of June 30, 2023. 
 On August 5, 2024, we entered into the Seventh Amendment to that certain Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement between Edgewell Personal Care, LLC and MUFG Bank, LTD., (the Accounts Receivable Facility which amended the pricing index used to determine the purchase price for subject receivables from the Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield Index BSBY to Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). The applicable margin that is added to the SOFR pricing index specific for each obligor was unchanged. Except as noted above, all other material terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Accounts Receivable Facility are unmodified in all respects and continue in full force and effect. 
 Effective February 7, 2022, we increased the maximum receivables sold facility amount under the Sixth Amendment to the Accounts Receivable Facility to 180.0 from 150.0. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the Accounts Receivable Facility. 
 On August 5, 2022, we entered into that certain Master Receivable Assignment Agreement between the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary Schick Japan K.K. and Concerto Receivables Corporation (the Purchaser ), Tokyo Branch, a subsidiary of MUFG Bank, LTD. (the "Japan Agreement"). The Japan Agreement allows us to assign third party accounts receivable to the 
 31 

Purchaser and allows for the sale of up to 3,000 (approximately 20.0 using the exchange rate as of September 30, 2023) with limits set between individual customers. The terms of the agreement expire one year after the date of execution and will be renewed annually unless either party notifies of its intent not to renew. The assigned receivables will be discounted using the funding rate from the Tokyo Interbank Market plus 1.1 . 
 Historically, we have generated, and expect to continue to generate, favorable cash flows from operations. Our cash flows are affected by the seasonality of our Sun Care business, typically resulting in higher net sales and increased cash generated in the second and third quarter of each fiscal year. We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital requirements, interest payments, R D activities, capital expenditures, and other financing requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will continue to monitor our cash flows, spending and liquidity needs. 
 Short-term financing needs primarily consist of working capital requirements and interest payments on our long-term debt. Long-term financing needs will depend largely on potential growth opportunities, including acquisition activity and repayment or refinancing of our long-term debt obligations. Our long-term liquidity may be influenced by our ability to borrow additional funds, renegotiate existing debt, and raise equity under terms that are favorable to us. We may, from time to time, seek to repurchase shares of our common stock. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
 In fiscal 2025, we expect our total capital expenditures to be in the range of 60 to 70 primarily on maintenance and productivity efforts across manufacturing facilities, new product development and information technology system enhancements. While we intend to fund these capital expenditures with cash generated from operations, we may also utilize our borrowing facilities. 
 During fiscal 2024, we did not make any contributions to our pension and post-retirement plans. Due to the election of certain terms of the American Rescue Plan Act, we were not required to make any cash contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in fiscal 2023. Pension contributions required beyond fiscal 2025 represent future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements in the U.S. only. The projected contributions for the U.S. pension plans total 6.5 in fiscal 2025, 7.0 in fiscal 2026, 5.0 in fiscal 2027, 4.5 in fiscal 2028, and 4.2 in fiscal 2029. Estimated contributions beyond fiscal 2029 are not determinable. The Company may also elect to make discretionary contributions. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 The Revolving Credit Facility governing our outstanding debt at September 30, 2024 contains certain customary representations and warranties, financial covenants, covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions, affirmative covenants, and provisions relating to events of default. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the ratio of our indebtedness to our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), as defined in the agreement and detailed below, cannot be greater than 4.0 to 1.0, however, there is an exception for acquisition activity. In addition, under the Revolving Credit Facility, the ratio of our EBITDA to total interest expense must exceed 3.0 to 1.0. If we fail to comply with these covenants or with other requirements of the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders have the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt. Acceleration under one of our facilities would trigger cross-defaults on our other borrowings. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, EBITDA is defined as net earnings, as adjusted to add-back interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, all of which are determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility allows certain non-cash charges such as stock award amortization and asset write-offs including, but not limited to, impairment and accelerated depreciation, and operating expense reductions or synergies to be added-back in determining EBITDA for purposes of the indebtedness ratio. Total debt and interest expense are calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with the Revolving Credit Facility.

 Operating Activities 
 Cash flow from operating activities was 231.0 in fiscal 2024, as compared to 216.1 in fiscal 2023. The increase in fiscal 2024 was driven by favorable changes in working capital, partially offset by decreased earnings.

 Inflation 
 Management recognizes that inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on our company through higher material costs, labor and transportation costs, asset replacement costs and related depreciation, healthcare and other costs. We continued to navigate the challenging and uncertain inflationary environment and resultant cost pressure with a combination of productivity efforts to achieve efficiencies and lower costs to our Cost of products sold and SG A expenses and increase focus on revenue management. We can provide no assurance that such mitigation will be available in the future.

Seasonality 
 Customer orders for sun care products within our Sun and Skin Care segment are highly seasonal. This has historically resulted in higher sun care sales to retailers during the late winter through mid-summer months. Within our Wet Shave segment, sales of women s products are moderately seasonal, with increased consumer demand in the spring and summer months. See Our business is subject to seasonal volatility in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Foreign Currency 
 Certain net sales and costs of our international operations are denominated in the local currency of the respective countries. As such, sales and profits from these subsidiaries may be impacted by fluctuations in the value of these local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. We also have significant intercompany financing arrangements that may result in gains and losses in our results of operations. In an effort to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate effects, we may hedge certain operational and intercompany transactions; however, our hedging strategies may not fully offset gains and losses recognized in our results of operations. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 We are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of our operations during the ordinary course of business. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. We review legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies when the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and discloses the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued if such disclosure is necessary for its financial statements to not be misleading. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, we believe that the Company s liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims, and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, when taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities. 
 Refer to Note 19 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Contractual Obligations 
 We have significant contractual obligations to fulfill our business operations including the repayment of short- and long-term debt, periodic interest payments, minimum levels of pension funding, and other obligations including payments for various leases of real estate, vehicles, and equipment, and minimum fixed costs to be paid to third party logistics vendors. We are also party to various service and supply contracts that generally extend one to three months. These arrangements are primarily individual, short-term purchase orders for routine goods and services at market prices, which are part of our normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. These contracts can generally be canceled at our option at any time. We do not believe such arrangements will adversely affect our liquidity position. In addition, we have various commitments related to service and supply contracts that contain penalty provisions for early termination. Because of the short period between order and shipment date (generally less than one month) for most of our orders, the dollar amount of current backlog is not material and is not considered to be a reliable indicator of future sales volume. Generally, sales to our top customers are made pursuant to purchase orders and we do not have supply agreements or guarantees of minimum purchases from them. As a result, these customers may cancel their purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us at any time. As of September 30, 2024, we do not believe such purchase arrangements or termination penalties will have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity position in the future. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our operations, like those of other companies, are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. These regulations relate primarily to worker safety, air and water quality, underground fuel storage tanks, and waste handling and disposal. Accrued environmental costs at September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 7.9 and 9.3, respectively. It is difficult to quantify with reasonable certainty the cost of environmental matters, particularly remediation and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses are not expected to have a material effect on our total capital and operating expenditures, consolidated earnings or competitive position. However, current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans or our understanding of underlying facts, changes in legal requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change, or other factors. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. Specific areas, among others, requiring the application of management s estimates and judgment include assumptions pertaining to accruals for consumer and trade promotion programs, pension and postretirement benefit costs, future cash flows associated with impairment testing of goodwill and other long-lived assets, uncertain tax positions, the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings and tax valuation allowances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, but actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
 Our most critical accounting estimates are revenue recognition, pension and other postretirement benefits, the valuation of long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment), income taxes (including uncertain tax positions) and valuation related to goodwill and intangible assets. A summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Our revenue is generated by the sales of finished products to customers. Those sales primarily contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when that control of goods passes to the customer, which is predominantly on the date of receipt by the customer. 
 The Company allows for returns of products under limited circumstances. Customers are required to pay for the Sun Care product purchased during the season under the required terms. Under certain circumstances, we allow customers to return Sun Care products that have not been sold by the end of the Sun Care season, which is normal practice in the Sun Care industry. At the time of sale, we reduce net sales and cost of products sold for anticipated returns based upon an estimated return level. The timing of returns of Sun Care products can vary in different regions, based on climate and other factors. However, the majority of returns occur in the U.S. from September through January, following the summer Sun Care season. We estimate the level of Sun Care returns as the Sun Care season progresses, using a variety of inputs including historical experience, consumption trends during the Sun Care season, obsolescence factors including expiration dates and inventory positions at key retailers. We monitor shipment activity and inventory levels at key retailers during the season in an effort to more accurately estimate potential returns. This allows us to manage shipment activity to our customers, especially in the latter stages of the Sun Care season, to reduce the potential for returned product. The level of returns may fluctuate from our estimates due to several factors, including, but not limited to, weather conditions, customer inventory levels and competitive 
 35 

activity. Based on our fiscal 2024 Sun Care shipments, each percentage point change in our returns rate would have impacted our reported net sales by 4.7 and our reported operating income by 4.8. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, our reserve on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for returns was 50.3 and 53.5, respectively. 
 We offer a variety of trade promotional programs, primarily to our retail customers, designed to promote sales of our products. Such programs require periodic payments and allowances based on estimated results of specific programs and are recorded as a reduction to net sales. We accrue, at the time of sale, the estimated total payments and allowances associated with each transaction. Additionally, we offer programs directly to consumers to promote the sale of our products. Promotions which reduce the ultimate consumer sale prices are recorded as a reduction of net sales at the time the promotional offer is made, generally using estimated redemption and participation levels. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. 
 
 Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits 
 The determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on certain assumptions developed by us and used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and future salary increases, where applicable. Actual results that differ from assumptions made are recognized on the balance sheet and subsequently amortized to earnings over future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in macroeconomic conditions resulting in changes to assumptions may materially affect pension and other post-retirement obligations. In determining the discount rate, we use the yield on high-quality bonds that coincide with the cash flows of our plans estimated payouts. For our U.S. plans, which represent our most significant obligations, we use the Mercer yield curve in determining the discount rates. 
 We utilize a spot discount rate approach to estimate service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension benefits. The spot discount rate approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows and is a more precise application of the yield curve spot rates used in the traditional single discount rate approach. 
 Of the assumptions listed above, changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used in developing plan obligations will likely have the most significant impact on our annual earnings, prospectively. Based on plan assets at September 30, 2024, a one percentage point decrease or increase in expected asset returns would increase or decrease our pension expense by approximately 4.2. In addition, it may increase and accelerate the rate of required pension contributions in the future. Uncertainty related to economic markets and the availability of credit may produce changes in the yields on corporate bonds rated as high-quality. As a result, discount rates based on high-quality corporate bonds may increase or decrease, leading to lower or higher pension obligations, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension obligations by approximately 49.5 at September 30, 2024. 
 As allowed under GAAP, our U.S. qualified pension plan uses market related value, which recognizes market appreciation or depreciation in the portfolio over five years, thereby reducing the short-term impact of market fluctuations. 
 We have historically provided defined benefit pension plans to our eligible employees, former employees and retirees. We fund our pension plans in compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or local funding requirements. 
 Further detail on our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans is included in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Valuation of Long-Lived Assets 
 We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and intangible assets, for potential impairment indicators. Judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators, including lower than expected cash flows from acquired businesses, are based on legal factors, market conditions and operational performance. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist. We estimate fair value using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows. This requires management to make assumptions regarding future income, working capital, and discount rates, which would affect the impairment calculation. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Our annual effective income tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in our financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, 
 36 

such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
 Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements, or assets recorded at estimated fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment. 
 We estimate income taxes and the effective income tax rate in each jurisdiction that we operate. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets, the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable and possible exposures related to future tax audits. Deferred tax assets are evaluated on a subsidiary by subsidiary basis to ensure that the asset will be realized. Valuation allowances are established when the realization is not deemed to be more likely than not. Future performance is monitored, and when objectively measurable operating trends change, adjustments are made to the valuation allowances accordingly. To the extent the estimates described above change, adjustments to income taxes are made in the period in which the estimate is changed. 
 We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax and regulatory environments, which are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. At times, we may take positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenges by the appropriate taxing authority. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with guidance governing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of the changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. 
 Further detail on Income Taxes is included in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Goodwill and Intangible Asset Valuations 
 Certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trade names and brands which are not amortized. At September 30, 2024 and 2023 we had goodwill of 1,338.6 and 1,331.4, respectively. We have indefinite-lived trade names and brands with a carrying value of approximately 597.7 and 592.9 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 1st and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value for goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets is below the carrying amount. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment. 
 In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes a variety of events and factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset, including, but not limited to: the results of prior quantitative assessments performed; macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, share price and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make a determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying value. 
 For our annual impairment assessment as of July 1, 2024, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment to evaluate certain goodwill reporting units and certain trade names and brands. The Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment on the other goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets noting no events that indicated that the fair value was less than the carrying value that would require a quantitative impairment assessment. 
 Goodwill 
 The Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment for the Sun Care reporting unit and a quantitative assessment for the Wet Shave, Skin Care and Fem Care reporting units. 
 In performing a quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit by using a weighted income and market approach. 
 The income approach uses the discounted cash flow method and incorporates each reporting unit s projections of estimated operating results and future cash flows and a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. The projections for future cash flows are based on the company s annual business and long-term strategic plan to determine a five-year period of forecasted cash flows. The financial projections reflect management s best estimate of economic and market conditions over the five-year projected period including forecasted revenue growth, EBITDA margin, tax rate, capital 
 37 

expenditures, depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital requirements. Other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate. 
 The market approach uses the guideline public company method to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit by applying earnings multiples to the operating performance of each reporting unit. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. The multiples are adjusted given the specific characteristics of the reporting unit including its position in the market relative to the guideline companies and applied to the reporting unit s operating data to arrive at an indication of fair value. 
 We also corroborate the fair value through a market capitalization reconciliation to determine whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on recent market transactions and other qualitative considerations. 
 The key assumptions for the market and income approaches used to determine fair value of the reporting units are updated at least annually. Those assumptions and estimates include market multiples, determination of comparable publicly traded companies, discount rates, terminal growth rates, and future levels of revenue growth and EBITDA margins based upon our annual business and strategic plan. The assumptions used for the income approach include a weighted-average cost of capital of 11.0 and terminal growth rates of 2.50 . 
 Based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment performed as of July 1, 2024, the fair values of our Wet Shave, Skin Care and Feminine Care reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 29 , 29 and 21 , respectively. 
 If actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, a material impairment charge of goodwill could occur, which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets 
 The Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment of the Schick and Bulldog trade names. We performed a qualitative test of impairment for all other indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 In performing a quantitative assessment of these trade names, we estimate the fair value using the relief-from-royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual and strategic plans; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trade name or brand; and a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment loss. 
 The key assumptions used in our relief-from-royalty model included revenue growth rates, the discount rate, terminal growth rate and assumed royalty rate. Revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and management s expectations for future growth by brand. The discount rates were based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar publicly traded companies. Terminal growth rates are based on industry market data. We estimated royalty rates based on the operating profits of the brand. The assumptions used for the relief-from-royalty method include a weighted-average cost of capital of 11.25 , terminal growth rate ranging from 0.25 to 2.50 and royalty rates ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 . 
 Based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment performed as of July 1, 2024, the fair values of our Schick and Bulldog trade names exceeded their respective carrying values by 70 and 14 , respectively. 
 If actual results are not consistent with management's estimate and assumptions, a material impairment charge of our trade names and brands could occur, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 For further discussion, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Determining the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires the use of significant judgment, estimates and assumptions. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodologies are reasonable, these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of the charge. The results of an impairment analysis are as of a point in time. There is no assurance that actual future earnings or cash flows of the reporting units will not decline significantly from these projections. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 in millions) 
 The market risk inherent in our financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in currency rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and our stock price. The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking statements of market risk, assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Company policy allows derivatives to be used only for identifiable exposures and, therefore, we do not enter into hedges for trading purposes where the sole objective is to generate profits. 
 
 Currency Rate Exposure 
 A significant share of our sales is tied to currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. As such, a weakening of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can have a negative impact to reported earnings. Conversely, strengthening of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can improve reported results. The primary currencies to which we are exposed include the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. 
 We do business in certain developing markets, which may be susceptible to greater volatility of inflation and currency exchange rates, as well as government pricing and import controls. While the activity is not considered material in relation to the consolidated company as a whole, there could be negative impacts to operating results in certain markets if inflationary pressures, exchange volatility and government controls negatively impact our ability to operate effectively and profitably. 
 
 Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Relationships 
 At September 30, 2024, we maintained a cash flow hedging program related to foreign currency risk. These derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying exposure being hedged and have been deemed highly effective by the Company for accounting purposes in offsetting the associated risk. 
 We enter into forward currency contracts to hedge the cash flow uncertainty associated with currency fluctuations. These transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges. We had unrealized pre-tax gains of 2.4 and 4.4 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on these forward currency contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCI ). Assuming foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar remain at September 30, 2024 levels over the next 12 months, the majority of the pre-tax gain included in AOCI at September 30, 2024 is expected to be included in Other expense (income), net. Contract maturities for these hedges extend into fiscal year 2026. There were 64 open foreign currency contracts at September 30, 2024 with a notional value of 106.5. 
 For further information on our derivatives designated as cash flow hedging relationships, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Relationships 
 Our foreign subsidiaries enter into internal and external transactions in the ordinary course of business that create non-functional currency balance sheet positions at the foreign subsidiary level. These exposures are generally the result of intercompany purchases, intercompany loans and, to a lesser extent, external purchases, and are revalued in the foreign subsidiary s local currency at the end of each period. Changes in the value of the non-functional currency balance sheet positions in relation to the foreign subsidiary s local currency result in an exchange gain or loss recorded in Other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The primary currency to which our foreign subsidiaries are exposed is the U.S. dollar. 
 To mitigate these balance sheet exposures, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. Any gains or losses on these contracts are expected to be offset by exchange gains or losses on the underlying exposure; thus, they are not subject to significant market risk. The change in the estimated fair value of the foreign currency contracts resulted in gains of 0.4 and 3.0 for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were recorded in Other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. There was one open foreign currency derivative contract with a notional value of 9.0. which was not designated as a cash flow hedge at September 30, 2024. 
 For further information on our derivatives not designated as cash flow hedging relationships, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 39 

Commodity Price Exposure 
 We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility. At times, we have used, and may in the future, use hedging instruments to reduce exposure to variability in cash flows associated with future purchases of certain materials and commodities. At September 30, 2024, there were no open derivative or hedging instruments for future purchases of raw materials or commodities. 
 
 Interest Rate Exposure 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our variable-rate debt instruments, which currently bear interest based on LIBOR plus margin. As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding debt included 34.0 related to our Revolving Credit Facility and international, variable-rate note payable. Assuming a one percent increase in the applicable interest rates, annual interest expense would increase by approximately 0.3. 
 The remaining outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024 is fixed-rate debt. Changes in market interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixed-rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows.

Responsibility for Financial Statements 
 The preparation and integrity of the financial statements of Edgewell Personal Care Company (the Company are the responsibility of its management. These statements have been prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United States of America, and in the opinion of management, fairly present the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The Company maintains accounting and internal control systems, which it believes are adequate to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements. The selection and training of qualified personnel, the establishment and communication of accounting and administrative policies and procedures, and a program of internal audits are important elements of these control systems. 
 The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee consisting solely of non-management directors, meets periodically with management, internal audit and the independent auditors to discuss audit and financial reporting matters. To ensure independence, our auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has direct access to the Audit Committee.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Edgewell Personal Care Company 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Edgewell Personal Care Company and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024 appearing under Item 15(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 42 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Goodwill Impairment Assessments Skin Care and Feminine Care Reporting Units 
 As described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2024 was 1,338.6 million, and the goodwill associated with the Sun and Skin Care and Feminine Care segments was 355.4 million and 206.2 million, respectively. Goodwill from the Skin Care reporting unit makes up a significant portion of the goodwill related to the Sun and Skin Care segment. Management performs their annual impairment assessment for goodwill as of July 1, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The goodwill impairment test compares a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying amount. When a quantitative test is performed, management estimates each reporting unit s fair value using a weighted income approach and market approach. As disclosed by management, determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant judgment, estimates and assumptions. The income approach uses the discounted cash flow method, and the key assumptions include discount rates, terminal growth rates, and future levels of revenue growth and EBITDA margins. The market approach uses the guideline public company method to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit by applying earnings multiples to the operating performance of each reporting unit, and the key assumptions include market multiples and determination of comparable publicly traded companies. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Skin Care and Feminine Care reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Skin Care and Feminine Care reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rate used in the discounted cash flow method for the Skin Care reporting unit, and revenue growth rates, terminal growth rate, EBITDA margins, and discount rate used in the discounted cash flow method for the Feminine Care reporting unit; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Company s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Skin Care and Feminine Care reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates and discount rate for the Skin Care reporting unit, and revenue growth rates, terminal growth rate, EBITDA margins, and discount rate for the Feminine Care reporting unit. Evaluating management s assumptions related to revenue growth rates for the Skin Care reporting unit and revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins for the Feminine Care reporting unit involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Skin Care and Feminine Care reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external relevant industry forecasts and macroeconomic conditions; (iii) management s historical forecasting accuracy; (iv) management s objectives and strategies; and (v) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company s discounted cash flow method and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumptions for the Skin Care and Feminine Care reporting units.

Note 3 - 
 , net of cash acquired. As a result of the Acquisition, Billie became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company accounted for the Acquisition utilizing the acquisition method of accounting, which requires assets and liabilities to be recognized based on estimates of their acquisition date fair values. The determination of the values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including goodwill, other intangible assets and deferred taxes, requires significant judgement. The Company has calculated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired from Billie, including goodwill, intangible assets and working capital. The Company completed the final fair value determination of the Acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. 
 The Company used variations of the income approach in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the Billie Acquisition. Specifically, we utilized the multi-period excess earnings method to determine the fair value of the definite lived customer relationships acquired and the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of the definite lived trade name acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates. Edgewell believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. 
 The following table provides the allocation of the purchase price related to the Billie Acquisition based upon the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed: 
 Current assets Goodwill Intangible assets Other assets, including property, plant and equipment, net Current liabilities ) Deferred tax liabilities ) 
 The acquired goodwill represented the value of expansion into new markets and channels of trade and is not deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets acquired consisted primarily of the Billie trade name and customer relationships with a weighted average useful life of years. All assets are included in the Company s Wet Shave segment. 
 Billie contributed net sales and a loss before income taxes totaling and , respectively, for the post-acquisition period ending September 30, 2022 in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The loss before income taxes was driven primarily by amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. 
 The following acquisition and integration costs related to Billie were included in SG A and Cost of products sold in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income:

 There were no material tax loss carryforwards that expired in fiscal 2024. Future expirations of tax loss carryforwards and tax credits, if not utilized, are not expected to be material from 2025 through 2041. The remaining tax loss carryforwards and credits have no expiration. The valuation allowance is primarily attributable to tax loss carryforwards, other carryforwards, and certain deferred tax assets impacted by the deconsolidation of the Company s Venezuelan subsidiaries. 
 The Company generally repatriates a portion of current year earnings from select non-US subsidiaries only if the economic cost of the repatriation is not considered material. No provision is made for additional taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates that are intended and planned to be indefinitely invested in the affiliate. The Company intends to, and has plans to, reinvest these earnings indefinitely in its foreign subsidiaries to, amongst other things, fund local operations, fund pension and other post-retirement obligations, fund capital projects and to support foreign growth initiatives including potential acquisitions. As of , of foreign subsidiary earnings were considered indefinitely invested in those businesses. If the Company repatriated any of the earnings it could be subject to withholding tax and the impact of foreign currency movements. Accordingly, it is not practical to calculate a specific potential tax exposure. Applicable income and withholding taxes will be provided on these earnings in the periods in which they are no longer considered reinvested. 
 Additions based on current year tax positions and acquisitions Settlements with taxing authorities and statute expirations ) ) ) Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year 
 Included in the unrecognized tax benefits noted above was of uncertain tax positions that would affect the Company s effective tax rate, if recognized. The Company does not expect any material increases or decreases to its unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this reporting date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, unrecognized tax benefits are classified as Other liabilities (non-current) to the extent that payments are not anticipated within one year. 
 The Company classifies accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The accrued interest and penalties are not included in the table above. The Company accrued of interest, (net of the deferred

 The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various cities and states, and more than foreign jurisdictions where the Company has operations. In general, U.S. federal income tax returns for tax years ended September 30, 2021 and after remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ). With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for years before September 30, 2014. The status of international income tax examinations varies by jurisdiction. At this time, the Company does not anticipate any material adjustments to its financial statements resulting from tax examinations currently in progress.

Under the Revolving Credit Facility, EBITDA is defined as net earnings, as adjusted to add-back interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, all of which are determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the credit agreement allows certain non-cash charges such as stock award amortization and asset write-offs including, but not limited to, impairment and accelerated depreciation, and operating expense reductions or synergies to be added-back in determining EBITDA for purposes of the indebtedness ratio. Total debt and interest expense are calculated in accordance with GAAP. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants or with other requirements of the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders may have the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt. Acceleration under the Revolving Credit Facility would trigger cross-defaults on its other borrowings. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with the Revolving Credit Facility.

 Pension plan assets in the U.S. plan represent of assets in all of the Company s defined benefit pension plans. Investment policy for the U.S. plan includes a mandate to diversify assets and invest in a variety of asset classes to achieve that goal. The U.S. plan s assets are currently invested in several funds representing most standard equity and debt security classes. The broad target allocations are: (a) equities, including U.S. and foreign: and (b) debt securities, including U.S. bonds: . Actual allocations at September 30, 2024 approximated these targets. The U.S. plan held shares of Company common stock at September 30, 2024. Investment objectives are similar for non-U.S. pension arrangements, subject to local regulations.

 The Company s investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to satisfy its current and future pension benefit obligations. The investment philosophy is to achieve this objective through diversification of the retirement plan assets with the goal of earning a suitable return with an appropriate level of risk while maintaining adequate liquidity to distribute benefit payments. The diversified asset allocation includes equity positions as well as fixed income investments. The increased volatility associated with equities is offset with higher expected returns, while long duration fixed income investments help dampen the volatility of the overall portfolio. Risk exposure is controlled by re-balancing the retirement plan assets back to target allocations, as needed. Investment firms managing retirement plan assets carry out investment policy within their stated guidelines. Investment performance is monitored against benchmark indices, which reflect the policy and target allocation of the retirement plan assets.

 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of its operations during the ordinary course of business. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. The Company reviews its legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. The Company establishes accruals for those contingencies when the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and discloses the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued if such disclosure is necessary for its financial statements to not be misleading. The Company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, the Company believes that its liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims, and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, when taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities. 
 Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 
 The operations of the Company are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and environment. 
 Contamination has been identified at certain of the Company s current and former facilities, as well as third-party waste disposal sites, and the Company is conducting investigation and remediation activities in relation to such properties. In connection with certain sites, the Company has received notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state agencies and private parties, that it has been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA ), and may be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to a number of federal Superfund sites. The Company may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites, and certain international locations, as well as any of its own properties. 
 Accrued environmental costs at and 2023 were and , respectively, and were recorded in Other Current Liabilities and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of the Company s ultimate liability in connection with those sites may depend on many factors, including the volume and toxicity of material contributed to the site, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability, and the remediation methods and technology to be used. Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses are not expected to have a material effect on the Company s total capital and operating expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Current environmental spending estimates may be modified as a result of changes in the Company s plans or its understanding of the underlying facts, changes in legal requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change, or other factors. 
 Many European countries, as well as the European Union, have been very active in adopting and enforcing environmental regulations. As such, it is possible that new regulations may increase the risk and expense of doing business in such countries.

 The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP for external purposes.
