Summary of Risk Factors 
 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that we face are related to:

the impact of alternative reference rates on our business and certain investments; 

our reliance on information systems, the failure of which could result in delays or other problems with our business activities, and the susceptibility of such systems to cybersecurity threats; 

our ability to replicate historical performance of other investment companies and funds with which our professionals have been affiliated; 

our ability to raise additional capital while remaining in compliance with certain annual distribution, asset coverage, asset composition and other regulatory requirements needed to maintain our status as a BDC and a RIC; 

the use of leverage to fund our investments, including the indebtedness resulting from the Credit Facility, 2026 Notes, 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt, and 2036 Asset-Backed Debt, and the risk that we may fail to comply with the terms governing such indebtedness or maintain certain asset coverage ratio requirements; 

our issuance of debt or other securities and the impact of such issuances on the value of our common stock or NAV; 

market conditions that may make it difficult for us to refinance or extend the maturity of our existing indebtedness; 

potential conflicts of interest of our Investment Adviser and Administrator; 

1 

the potential dilution caused by any future issuances of subscription rights or warrants; 

the impact of recent financial reform legislation and uncertainty about any future laws and regulations on our business and our portfolio companies; 

the investment objectives and decisions advanced by the board of directors or the Investment Adviser which are not subject to stockholder approval and potential activism by our shareholders; 

the illiquid nature of the assets in which we invest and our valuation procedures with respect to such assets; 

making investments in loans bearing a variable-rate of interest, or floating rate loans, first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and the equity of certain portfolio companies, and the risks of making such investments in privately held middle-market companies; 

the Investment Adviser s incentive to make speculative investments to earn a greater incentive fee and, in some instances, our obligation to pay incentive compensation to our Investment Adviser even after we incur a loss; 

our investment in derivatives and the use of leverage; 

the potential dilution of our common stock which may result from issuances of our common stock below the then current NAV per share; 

our allocation of net proceeds from offering in ways which you may not agree and our inability to invest proceeds from offerings in new investment opportunities, which could negatively affect our financial performance; 

tax liabilities resulting from receiving our stock as a distribution; 

the measures we have taken to deter takeover attempts, which may adversely impact the price of our common stock; 

our interests in connection with the debt securitizations and the offering of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt, and 2036 Asset-Backed Debt by the securitization issuers; 

changes to political, economic or industry conditions or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, could cause volatility or prolonged disruption of the capital markets and impact the value of our assets; 

our cash balances at financial institutions that exceed federally insured limits and the impact of adverse developments affecting the financial services industry; 

the impact of economic sanction laws in the United States and other jurisdictions which may prohibit us and our affiliates from transacting with certain countries, individuals and companies; 

potential litigation, whether initiated by shareholders or other parties, and, with respect to the holders of our 2026 Notes, the ability to enforce civil judgments against us and our directors, officers and experts; and 

the impact of global climate change on the operations of our portfolio companies. 

we have in the past, and may in the future, identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, which may result in future financial statements containing errors that will be undetected and could impact the operations of our business including our ability to obtain financing, the cost of any financing we obtain or require additional expenditures of resources to comply with applicable requirements. 

Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results. For a more detailed discussion of the risks that you should consider prior to investing in our securities, see Item 1A. Risk Factors below. 
 Item 1.	B usiness 
 General Business of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. 
 PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. is a BDC whose objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation while seeking to preserve capital by investing primarily in floating rate loans, and other investments made to U.S. middle-market companies. 
 We believe that floating rate loans to U.S. middle-market companies offer attractive risk-reward to investors due to a limited amount of capital available for such companies. We use the term middle-market to refer to companies with annual revenues between 50 million and 1 billion. Our investments are typically rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans, high yield securities or junk bonds and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. However, when compared to junk bonds and other non-investment grade debt, senior secured floating rate loans typically have more robust capital-preserving qualities, such as historically lower default rates than junk bonds, represent the senior source of capital in a borrower s capital structure and often have certain of the borrower s assets pledged as collateral. Our debt investments may generally range in maturity from three to ten years and are made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions. 
 Under normal market conditions, we generally expect that at least 80 of the value of our managed assets, which means our net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes, will be invested in floating rate loans and other investments bearing a variable-rate of interest. We generally expect that first lien secured debt will represent at least 65 of our overall portfolio. We also generally expect to invest up to 35 of our overall portfolio opportunistically in other types of investments, including second lien secured debt and subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. We seek to create a diversified portfolio by generally targeting an investment size between 5 million and 30 million, on average, although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. 
 2 

Our investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. 
 Organization and Structure of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. 
 PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd., a Maryland corporation organized in October 2010, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. 
 We execute our investment strategy directly and through our wholly owned subsidiaries, our unconsolidated joint venture and unconsolidated limited partnership. The term "subsidiary" means entities that primarily engage in investments activities in securities or other assets that are wholly owned by us. The Company does not intend to create or acquire primary control of an entity which primarily engages in investment activities of securities or other assets other than entities wholly owned by the Company. We comply with the provisions of Section 17 of the 1940 Act related to affiliated transactions and custody. To the extent that the Company forms a subsidiary advised by an investment adviser other than the Investment Adviser, the investment adviser to such subsidiaries will comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act relating to investment advisory contracts, including but not limited to, Section 15, as if it were an investment adviser to the Company under Section 2(a)(20) of the 1940 Act. 
 Our Investment Adviser and Administrator 
 We utilize the investing experience and contacts of PennantPark Investment Advisers in developing what we believe is an attractive and diversified portfolio. The senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser have worked together for many years and average over 25 years of experience in the senior lending, mezzanine lending, leveraged finance, distressed debt and private equity businesses. In addition, our senior investment professionals have been involved in originating, structuring, negotiating, managing and monitoring investments in each of these businesses across changing economic and market cycles. We believe this experience and history have resulted in a strong reputation with financial sponsors, management teams, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which provides us with access to substantial investment opportunities across the capital markets. Our Investment Adviser has a rigorous investment approach, which is based upon intensive financial analysis with a focus on capital preservation, diversification and active management. Since our Investment Adviser s inception in 2007, it has invested through its managed funds 22.4 billion in 704 companies with more than 200 different financial sponsors through its managed funds, which includes investments by the Company totaling 6.3 billion in 512 companies. 
 Our Administrator has experienced professionals with substantial backgrounds in finance and administration of registered investment companies. In addition to furnishing us with clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services, the Administrator also oversees our financial records as well as the preparation of our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The Administrator assists in the determination and publication of our net asset value, or NAV, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and monitors the payment of our expenses as well as the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Furthermore, our Administrator offers, on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer such assistance. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns for more information. 
 Market Opportunity 
 We believe that the limited amount of capital available to middle-market companies, coupled with the desire of these companies for flexible sources of capital, creates an attractive investment environment for us. 
 We believe middle-market companies have faced difficulty raising debt in private markets. From time to time, banks, finance companies, hedge funds and collateralized loan obligation, or CLO, funds have withdrawn, and may again withdraw, capital from the middle-market, resulting in opportunities for alternative funding sources. 

We believe middle-market companies have faced difficulty in raising debt through the capital markets. Many middle-market companies look to raise funds by issuing high-yield bonds and broadly syndicated loans. We believe this approach to financing becomes difficult at times when institutional investors seek to invest in larger, more liquid offerings. We believe this has made it harder for middle-market companies to raise funds by issuing high-yield securities from time to time. 

We believe that credit market dislocation for middle-market companies improves the risk-reward on our investments. From time to time, market participants have reduced lending to middle-market and non-investment grade borrowers. As a result, we believe there is less competition in our market, more conservative capital structures, higher yields and stronger covenants. 

We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek to combine their capital with sources of debt capital to complete private investments. We expect that private equity firms will continue to be active investors in middle-market companies. These private equity funds generally seek to leverage their investments by combining their capital with loans provided by other sources, and we believe that we are well-positioned to partner with such equity investors. 

We believe there is substantial supply of opportunities resulting from maturing loans that seek refinancing. A high volume of financings will come due in the next few years. Additionally, we believe that demand for debt financing from middle-market companies will remain strong because these companies will continue to require credit to refinance existing debt, to support growth initiatives and to finance acquisitions. We believe the combination of strong demand by middle-market companies and, from time to time, the reduced supply of credit described above should increase lending opportunities for us. We believe this supply of opportunities coupled with a lack of demand offers attractive risk-reward to investors. 

Competitive Advantages 
 We believe that we have the following competitive advantages over other capital providers to middle-market companies: 
 a) Experienced Management Team 

The senior investment professionals of our Investment Adviser have worked together for many years and average over 25 years of experience in senior lending, mezzanine lending, leveraged finance, distressed debt and private equity businesses. These senior investment professionals have been involved in originating, structuring, negotiating, managing and monitoring investments in each of these businesses across changing economic and market cycles. We believe this extensive experience and history have resulted in a strong reputation across the capital markets. 
 3 

Lending to middle-market companies requires in-depth diligence, credit expertise, restructuring experience and active portfolio management. For example, lending to middle-market companies in the United States is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of the information available with respect to such companies. We are able to provide value-added customized financial solutions to middle-market companies as a result of specialized due diligence, underwriting capabilities and more extensive ongoing monitoring required as lenders. 
 b) Disciplined Investment Approach with Strong Value Orientation 

We employ a disciplined approach in selecting investments that meet the long-standing, consistent value-oriented investment selection criteria employed by our Investment Adviser. Our value-oriented investment philosophy focuses on preserving capital and ensuring that our investments have an appropriate return profile in relation to risk. When market conditions make it difficult for us to invest according to our criteria, we are highly selective in deploying our capital. We believe this approach continues to enable us to build an attractive investment portfolio that meets our return and value criteria over the long-term. 
 We believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence on investment targets. In evaluating new investments we, through our Investment Adviser, conduct a rigorous due diligence process that draws from our Investment Adviser s experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. Among other things, our due diligence is designed to ensure that each prospective portfolio company will be able to meet its debt service obligations. See Investment Selection Criteria for more information. 
 In addition to engaging in extensive due diligence, our Investment Adviser seeks to reduce risk by focusing on businesses with: 
 strong competitive positions; 

positive cash flow that is steady and stable; 

experienced management teams with strong track records; 

potential for growth and viable exit strategies; and 

capital structures offering appropriate risk-adjusted terms and covenants. 

c) Ability to Source and Evaluate Transactions through our Investment Adviser s Proactive Research Capability and Established Network 

The management team of our Investment Adviser has long-term relationships with financial sponsors, management consultants and management teams that we believe enable us to evaluate investment opportunities effectively in numerous industries, as well as provide us access to substantial information concerning those industries. We identify potential investments both through active origination and through dialogue with numerous financial sponsors, management teams, members of the financial community and corporate partners with whom the professionals of our Investment Adviser have long-term relationships. 
 d) Flexible Transaction Structuring 

We are flexible in structuring investments and tailor investments to meet the needs of a portfolio company while also generating attractive risk-adjusted returns. We can invest in all parts of a capital structure and our Investment Adviser has extensive experience in a wide variety of securities for leveraged companies throughout economic and market cycles. 
 Our Investment Adviser seeks to minimize the risk of capital loss without foregoing potential for capital appreciation. In making investment decisions, we seek to invest in companies that we believe can generate consistent positive risk-adjusted returns. 
 We believe that the in-depth experience of our Investment Adviser will enable us to invest throughout various stages of the economic and market cycles and to provide us with ongoing market insights in addition to a significant investment opportunity. 
 Competition 
 Our primary competitors provide financing to middle-market companies and include other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies, CLO funds, private direct lending funds and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, frequently invest in middle-market companies. As a result, competition for investment opportunities in middle-market companies can be intense. However, we believe that from time to time there has been a reduction in the amount of debt capital available to middle-market companies, which we believe has resulted in a less competitive environment for making new investments. 
 Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities for more information. 
 Leverage 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we maintained a 636.0 million Credit Facility, which matures in August 2029, with the Lenders. The Credit Facility currently bears interest at SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 225 basis points and, after the revolving period ends in August 2027, the rate will reset to Base Rate (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 250 basis points. The Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets held by Funding I, under which we had 443.9 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 7.5 , exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments as of September 30, 2024. The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 7.7 , exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 192.1 million and 376.6 million of unused borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, respectively, subject to the regulatory restrictions. We believe that our capital resources will provide us with the flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities when they arise. Our use of leverage, as calculated under the asset coverage requirements of the 1940 Act, may generally range between 140 and 170 of our net assets, or approximately 60 to 65 of our managed assets. We cannot assure investors that our leverage will remain within the range. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. 
 
 In November 2017, we issued 138.6 million aggregate principal amount of our 2023 Notes that matured on December 15, 2023. The 2023 Notes were issued pursuant to a deed of trust between the Company and Mishmeret Trust Company, Ltd. as trustee, in November 2017. In connection with this offering, we dual listed our common stock on the TASE. On February 7, 2024, the Company filed a notice with the Israel Securities Authority and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd (the "TASE") 
 4 

voluntarily requesting to delist the Company's common stock from trading on the TASE. The last day of trading on the TASE was May 6, 2024 and the delisting of the Company's common stock form the TASE took effect on May 8, 2024. 
 
 The 2023 Notes paid interest at a rate of 4.3 per year. Interest on the 2023 Notes was payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2018. The principal on the 2023 Notes was payable in four annual installments as follows: 15 of the original principal amount on December 15, 2020, 15 of the original principal amount on December 15, 2021, 15 of the original principal amount on December 15, 2022 and 55 of the original principal amount on December 15, 2023. On December 15, 2023, the remaining outstanding 2023 Notes were repaid in full. 
 
 In March 2021, and in October 2021, we issued 100.0 million and 85.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a public offering price per note of 99.4 and 101.5 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 185.0 million and 185.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes outstanding, respectively. The 2026 Notes were issued pursuant to the base Indenture, dated March 23, 2021, between the Company and American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC (the Trustee ), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated March 23, 2021, between the Company and the Trustee. The 2026 Notes are due on April 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company s option. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.25 per year payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2026 Notes are the Company s direct unsecured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with the Company s current and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of the Company s future indebtedness that expressly states it is subordinated in right of payment to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured, but to which the Company subsequently grant security) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company s subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system. 
 
 In September 2019, the Securitization Issuers completed the Debt Securitization. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by the middle market loans, participation interests in middle market loans and other assets of the Securitization Issuer. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature on October 15, 2031. On the closing date of the Debt Securitization, in consideration of our transfer to the Securitization Issuer of the initial closing date loan portfolio, which included loans distributed to us by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries, the Securitization Issuer transferred to us 100 of the Preferred Shares of the Securitization Issuer, 100 of the Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes issued by the Securitization Issuer and a portion of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt. As of both September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had zero and 228.0 million of 2031 Asset-Backed Debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of zero and 7.1 , respectively. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information. 
 In July 2024, the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt was refinanced through a 351.0 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation, or the "2036-R Asset-Backed Debt". The 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt was executed through: (A) the issuance by the 2036-R Securitization Issuers of the following classes of notes pursuant that certain indenture, dated September 19, 2019, by and among the 2036-R Securitization Issuers and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as amended by the second supplemental indenture, dated June 25, 2024): (i) 203 million of A-1-R Notes, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 1.75 , (ii) 10.5 million of A-2-R Notes, which bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 1.90 , (iii) 12 million of Class B-R Notes, which bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 2.05 , (iv) 28 million of C-R Notes, which bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 2.75 and (v) 21 million of D-R Notes, which bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 4.30 , (B) the issuance by the issuer of 64 million of subordinated notes pursuant to the Indenture and (C) the borrowing by one of the 2036-R Securitization Issuers of 12.5 million of Class B-R Loans, which bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 2.05 , pursuant to a credit agreement, by and among the 2036-R Securitization Issuers, the various financial institutions and other persons party thereto, as lenders and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as loan agent and as trustee. The 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt matures in July 2036. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 266.0 million of 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 7.2 . As of September 30, 2024, the unamortized fees on the 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt were 0.8 million. 
 In February 2024, the 2036 Asset-Backed Debt was issued by the 2036 Securitization Issuer. The 2036 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by the middle market loans, participation interests in middle market loans and other assets of the 2036 Securitization Issuer. The Debt Securitization was executed through (A) a private placement of: (i) 139.5 million of AAA(sf) Class A-1 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month secured overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York SOFR plus 2.30 , (ii) 14 million of AAA(sf) Class A-2 Notes, which bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 2.70 , (iii) 24.5 million of AA(sf) Class B Notes, which bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 2.90 , (iv) 28 million of A(sf) Class C Notes, which bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 3.90 , (v) 21 million of BBB-(sf) Class D Notes, which bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 5.90 , (together, the Secured Notes ), and (vi) 63.6 million of subordinated notes Subordinated Notes and (B) the borrowing of 60.0 million AAA(sf) Class A-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Loans (the Class A-1 Loans and together with the Secured Notes and Subordinated Notes, the Debt ), which bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 2.30 , under a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ), dated as of the Closing Date, by and among the Issuer, as borrower, various financial institutions, as lenders, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as collateral agent and as loan agent. The annualized interest on the 2036 Asset-Backed Debt will be paid, to the extent of funds available. The Debt is scheduled to mature on April 18, 2036. The 2036 Asset-Backed Debt is included in the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as debt of the Company and the Subordinated Notes of the 2036-Securitization Issuer were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 287.0 million of 2036 Asset-Backed Debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 8.1 . As of September 30, 2024, the unamortized fees on the 2036 Asset-Backed Debt were 2.9 million. 
 
 In April 2021, we formed PTSF, an unconsolidated limited partnership, organized as a Delaware limited liability partnership. We sold 81.4 million in investments to a wholly-owned subsidiary of PTSF in exchange for cash in the amount of 69.5 million and an 11.9 million equity interest in PTSF representing 23.08 of the total outstanding Class A Units of PTSF. We recognized 0.4 million of realized gain upon the formation of PTSF. As of September 30, 2024, our capital commitment of 15.3 million is fully funded and we hold 23.08 of the total outstanding Class A Units of PTSF and a 4.99 voting interest in the general partner which manages PTSF. 
 
 On April 5, 2018, our board of directors approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the Small Business Credit Availability Act). As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200 (i.e., 1 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity) to 150 (i.e., 2 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity), effective as of April 5, 2019, subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 174 and 230 , respectively. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information. 
 Investment Policy Overview 
 We seek to create a diversified portfolio primarily of floating rate loans by generally targeting an investment size of 5 million to 30 million in securities, on average, of middle-market companies. We expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We generally expect that first lien secured debt will represent at least 65 of our overall portfolio. We also generally expect to invest up to 35 of our overall portfolio opportunistically in other types of investments, including second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, are not rated by national rating agencies. If such unrated companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard Poor s system) from the national rating agencies. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged 
 5 

loans, high yield securities or junk bonds and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. In addition, we expect our debt investments to range in maturity from three to ten years. 
 
 Over time, we expect that our portfolio will continue to consist primarily of floating rate loans in qualifying assets such as private, or thinly traded or small market-capitalization, U.S. middle-market public companies. In addition, we may invest up to 30 of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets. These non-qualifying assets may include investments in public companies whose securities are not thinly traded or have a market capitalization of greater than 250 million, securities of middle-market companies located outside of the United States and investment companies as defined in the 1940 Act. We may acquire investments in the secondary markets. See Regulation Qualifying Assets and Investment Selection Criteria for more information. 
 
 Our board of directors has the authority to modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval (except as required by the 1940 Act). However, absent stockholder approval, under the 1940 Act we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and value of our common stock. Nevertheless, the effects of changes to our operating policies and strategies may adversely affect our business, our ability to make distributions and the value of our common stock. 
 
 First Lien Secured Debt 
 
 Structurally, first lien secured debt ranks senior in priority of payment to second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity and benefits from a senior security interest in the assets of the borrower. As such, other creditors rank junior to our investments in these securities in the event of insolvency. Due to its lower risk profile and often more restrictive covenants as compared to second lien secured debt and subordinated debt, first lien secured debt generally earns a lower return than second lien secured debt and subordinated debt. In some cases first lien secured debt lenders receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers and from time to time may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 Second Lien Secured Debt 
 
 Second lien secured debt usually ranks junior in priority of payment to first lien secured debt. Second lien secured debt holds a second priority with regard to right of payment in the event of insolvency. Second lien secured debt ranks senior to subordinated debt and common and preferred equity in borrowers capital structures. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt generally earns a higher return than first lien secured debt. In many cases, second lien secured debt investors receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers and from time to time may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 Subordinated Debt 
 
 Structurally, subordinated debt usually ranks junior in priority of payment to first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt, and is often unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of insolvency. Subordinated debt ranks senior to common and preferred equity in borrowers capital structures. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt, subordinated debt generally earns a higher return than first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt. In many cases, subordinated debt investors receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers, and from time to time, may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis. 
 Investment Selection Criteria 
 We are committed to a value-oriented philosophy used by the senior investment professionals of our Investment Adviser who manage our portfolio and seek to minimize the risk of capital loss without foregoing potential for capital appreciation. 
 We have identified several criteria, discussed below, that we believe are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions. However, we caution that not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest. Generally, we seek to use our experience and access to market information to identify investment opportunities and to structure investments efficiently and effectively. 
 a) Leading and defensible competitive market positions 

The Investment Adviser invests in portfolio companies that it believes have developed strong positions within their markets. The Investment Adviser also seeks to invest in portfolio companies that it believes possess competitive advantages in, for example, scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing or product quality as compared to their competitors to protect their market position. 
 b) Investing in stable borrowers with positive cash flow 

Our investment philosophy places a premium on fundamental analysis and has a distinct value-orientation. The Investment Adviser invests in portfolio companies it believes to be stable and well-established, with strong cash flows and profitability. The Investment Adviser believes these attributes indicate portfolio companies that may be well-positioned to maintain consistent cash flow to service and repay their liabilities and maintain growth in their businesses or their relative market share. The Investment Adviser currently does not expect to invest significantly in start-up companies, companies in turnaround situations or companies with speculative business plans, although we are permitted to do so. 
 c) Proven management teams 

The Investment Adviser focuses on investments in which the portfolio company has an experienced management team with an established track record of success. The Investment Adviser typically requires that portfolio companies have in place proper incentives to align management s goals with our goals, including having equity interests. 
 d) Financial sponsorship 

The Investment Adviser may seek to cause us to participate in transactions sponsored by what it believes to be trusted financial sponsors. The Investment Adviser believes that a financial sponsor s willingness to invest significant equity capital in a portfolio company is an implicit endorsement of the quality of that portfolio company. Further, financial sponsors of portfolio companies with significant investments at risk may have the ability, and a strong incentive, to contribute additional capital in difficult economic times should financial or operational issues arise so as to maintain their ownership position. 
 6 

e) Investments in different borrowers, industries and geographies 

The Investment Adviser seeks to invest our assets broadly among portfolio companies, across industries and geographical regions. The Investment Adviser believes that this approach may reduce the risk that a downturn in any one portfolio company, industry or geographical region will have a disproportionate impact on the value of our portfolio, although we are permitted to be non-diversified under the 1940 Act. 
 f) Viable exit strategy 

The Investment Adviser seeks to invest in portfolio companies that it believes will provide a steady stream of cash flow to repay our loans while also reinvesting in their respective businesses. The Investment Adviser expects that such internally generated cash flow, leading to the payment of interest on, and the repayment of the principal of, our investments in portfolio companies to be a key means by which we will exit from our investments over time. In addition, the Investment Adviser also seeks to invest in portfolio companies whose business models and expected future cash flows offer attractive exit possibilities. These companies include candidates for strategic acquisition by other industry participants and companies that may repay our investments through an initial public offering of common stock, refinancing or other capital markets transaction. 
 Due Diligence 
 We believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence in evaluating new investment targets. Our Investment Adviser conducts a rigorous due diligence process that is applied to prospective portfolio companies and draws from our Investment Adviser s experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. In conducting due diligence, our Investment Adviser uses information provided by companies, financial sponsors and publicly available information as well as information from relationships with former and current management teams, consultants, competitors and investment bankers. 
 Our due diligence may include: 
 review of historical and prospective financial information; 

research relating to the portfolio company s management, industry, markets, products and services and competitors; 

interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors of the potential portfolio company; 

on-site visits; 

review of loan documents; and 

background checks. 

Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys and accountants prior to the closing of the investment, as well as other outside advisers, as appropriate. 
 Upon the completion of due diligence on a portfolio company, the team leading the investment presents the investment opportunity to our Investment Adviser s investment committee. This committee determines whether to pursue the potential investment. All new investments are required to be reviewed by the investment committee of our Investment Adviser. The members of the investment committee receive no compensation from us. Rather, they are employees of and receive compensation from our Investment Adviser. 
 Investment Structure 
 Once we determine that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that portfolio company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, to structure an investment. We negotiate with these parties to agree on how our investment is structured relative to the other capital in the portfolio company s capital structure. 
 We expect our floating rate loans to have terms of three to ten years. We generally obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that will serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral may take the form of first priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. 
 Typically, our second lien secured debt and subordinated debt investments have maturities of three to ten years. Second lien secured debt and subordinated debt may take the form of a second priority lien on the assets of a portfolio company and have interest-only payments in the early years with cash or payment-in-kind, or PIK, payments with amortization of principal deferred to the later years. In some cases, we may invest in debt securities that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. Also, in some cases, our second lien secured debt and subordinated debt may be collateralized by a subordinated lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower. 
 We seek to tailor the terms of the investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. For example, in addition to seeking a senior position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, we seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by: 
 requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest in the form of a floor and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk; 

incorporating put rights and call protection into the investment structure; and 

negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with our focus of preserving capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights. 

Our investments may include equity features, such as direct investments in the equity securities of borrowers or warrants or options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we may receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, so as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from these equity investments. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the portfolio company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity investments, which may include demand and piggyback registration rights. 
 7 

We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may exit certain investments earlier when a liquidity event, such as the sale or refinancing of a portfolio company, takes place. We also may turn over investments to better position the portfolio in light of market conditions. 
 Ongoing Relationships with Portfolio Companies 
 Monitoring 
 The Investment Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Investment Adviser also monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company. 
 The Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success in adhering to a portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; 

periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; 

attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and 

review of periodic financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 

The Investment Adviser monitors credit risk of each portfolio company regularly with a goal toward identifying early, and when able and appropriate, exiting investments with potential credit problems. This monitoring process may include reviewing: (1) a portfolio company s financial resources and operating history; (2) comparing a portfolio company s current operating results with the Investment Adviser s initial thesis for the investment and its expectations for the performance of the investment; (3) a portfolio company s sensitivity to economic conditions; (4) the performance of a portfolio company s management; (5) a portfolio company s debt maturities and capital requirements; (6) a portfolio company s interest and asset coverage; and (7) the relative value of an investment based on a portfolio company s anticipated cash flow. 
 Managerial Assistance 
 We offer significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. As a BDC, we are required to make available such significant managerial assistance within the meaning of Section 2(a)(47) of the 1940 Act. See Regulation for more information. 
 Staffing 
 We do not currently have any employees. Our Investment Adviser and Administrator have hired and expect to continue to hire professionals with skills applicable to our business plan, including experience in middle-market investing, senior lending, mezzanine lending, leveraged finance, distressed debt and private equity businesses.

(1) Excludes investments in PSSL. 

Our executive officers and directors, as well as the senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and Administrator, may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do. Currently, the executive officers and directors, as well as certain of the current senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and Administrator, serve as officers and directors of PennantPark Investment Corporation, a publicly traded BDC, and other managed funds, as applicable. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which obligations might not be in the best interest of us or our stockholders. In addition, we note that any affiliated investment vehicle currently existing, or formed in the future, and managed by the Investment Adviser and/or its affiliates may, notwithstanding different stated investment objectives, have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, the Investment Adviser may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities among us and such other entities. The Investment Adviser will allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner consistent with our allocation policy, and we have received exemptive relief with respect to certain co-investment transactions. Where co-investment is unavailable or inappropriate, the Investment Adviser will choose which investment fund should receive the allocation. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns for more information. 
 We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies and companies that would be investment companies but are excluded from the definition of an investment company provided in Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act. We may also co-invest in the future on a concurrent basis with our affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable regulations, our trade allocation procedures and, if applicable, the terms of our exemptive relief.

Investment Management Agreement 
 We have entered into an agreement with the Investment Adviser, or the Investment Management Agreement, under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, us. Mr. Penn, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing member and a senior investment professional of, and has a financial and controlling interest in, PennantPark Investment Advisers. PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd., through the Investment Adviser, provides similar services to Funding I under its collateral management agreement. Funding I s collateral management agreement does not affect the management or incentive fees that we pay to the Investment Adviser on a consolidated basis. Under the terms of our Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser: 
 determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; 

identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); 

closes and monitors the investments we make; and 

provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may need from time to time. 

PennantPark Investment Advisers services under our Investment Management Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services, without the prior approval of our stockholders or our board of directors, to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. Our board of directors monitors for any potential conflicts that may arise upon such a development. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from us, consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee or, collectively, Management Fees. 
 Investment Advisory Fees 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00 of our average adjusted gross assets, which equals our gross assets (net of U.S. Treasury Bills, temporary draws under any credit facility, cash and cash equivalents, repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions undertaken at the end of a fiscal quarter for purposes of preserving investment flexibility for the next quarter and unfunded commitments, if any) and is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average adjusted gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. For example, if we sold shares on the 45th day of a quarter and did not use the proceeds from the sale to repay outstanding indebtedness, our gross assets for such quarter would give effect to the net proceeds of the issuance for only 45 days of the quarter during which the additional shares were outstanding. For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded earned a base management expense of 14.9 million, 11.4 million and 11.9 million, respectively. 
 The following is a hypothetical example of the calculation of average adjusted gross assets: 
 Gross assets as of December 31, 20XX = 160 million 
 U.S. Treasury bills and temporary draws on credit facilities as of December 31, 20XX = 10 million 
 Adjusted gross assets as of December 31, 20XX = 150 million 
 Gross assets as of March 31, 20XX = 200 million 
 U.S. Treasury bills and temporary draws on credit facilities as of March 31, 20XX = 20 million 
 Adjusted gross assets as of March 31, 20XX = 180 million 
 Average value of adjusted gross assets as of March 31, 20XX and December 31, 20XX, which are the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter equals 150 million + 180 million) / 2 = 165 million. 
 The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: 
 One part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income, including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as amendment, commitment, origination, prepayment penalties, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees received from portfolio companies, accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), and any interest expense or amendment fees under any credit facility and distribution paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, or OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a percentage of the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75 per quarter (7.00 annualized). We pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.75 , (2) 50 of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.9167 in any calendar quarter (11.67 annualized) (we refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.9167 as the catch-up, which is meant to provide our Investment Adviser with 20 of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, as if a hurdle did not apply, if this net investment income exceeds 2.9167 in any calendar quarter), and (3) 20 of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.9167 in any calendar quarter. These calculations are pro-rated for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter, if applicable. For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Investment Adviser earned 18.1 million, 16.9 million and 11.6 million, respectively, in incentive fees on net investment income from us. 
 The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of quarterly incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income: 
 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 
 10 

Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 allocated to income-related portion of incentive fee 
 The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date) and equals 20 of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we accrued an incentive fee on capital gains of zero, respectively, as calculated under the Investment Management Agreement (as described above). 
 Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized capital gains and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the capital gains incentive fee accrual, we considered the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then we record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 20 of such amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains related to incentive fees paid or accrued in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such year. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. The incentive fee accrued for under GAAP on our unrealized and realized capital gains for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was zero, respectively. 
 Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation 
 Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee ): 
 Alternative 1: 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25 
 Hurdle (1) = 1.75 
 Base management fee (2) = 0.25 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 (investment income (base management fee + other expenses)) = 0.80 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed hurdle; therefore, there is no incentive fee. 
 Alternative 2: 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.70 
 Hurdle (1) = 1.75 
 Base management fee (2) = 0.25 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 (investment income (base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.25 

Incentive fee 
 
 = 50 X Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, subject to catch-up 

= 50 X (2.25 - 1.75 

= 0.25 

11 

Alternative 3: 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 4.00 
 Hurdle (1) = 1.75 
 Base management fee (2) = 0.25 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 (investment income (base management fee + other expenses)) = 3.55 

Incentive fee 
 
 = 20 X Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, subject to catch-up (3) 

Incentive fee 
 
 = 50 X catch-up + (20 x (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income - 2.9167 )) 

Catch-up 
 
 = 2.9167 - 1.75 

= 1.1667 

= (50 X 1.1667 + (20 X (3.55 - 2.9167 )) 

= 0.5833 + (20 X 0.6333 

= 0.5833 + 0.1267 

= 0.71 

The hypothetical amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets. 
 (1) Represents 7.0 annualized hurdle. 

(2) Represents 1.0 annualized base management fee. 

(3) The catch-up provision is intended to provide the Investment Adviser with an incentive fee of approximately 20 on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.9167 in any calendar quarter. 

Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee: 
 Alternative 1: 
 Assumptions 
 Year 1: 20 million investment made in Company A Investment A ), and 30 million investment made in Company B Investment B 
 Year 2: Investment A sold for 50 million and fair market value FMV of Investment B determined to be 32 million 
 Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be 25 million 
 Year 4: Investment B sold for 31 million 
 The capital gains portion of the incentive fee, if any, would be: 
 Year 1: None 
 Year 2: 6 million capital gains incentive fee 
 30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20 
 Year 3: None 
 5 million cumulative fee (20 multiplied by 25 million 30 million cumulative capital gains less 5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less 6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2) 
 Year 4: 200,000 capital gains incentive fee 
 6.2 million cumulative fee 31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20 less 6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2). 
 Alternative 2: 
 Assumptions 
 Year 1: 20 million investment made in Company A Investment A ), 30 million investment made in Company B Investment B and 25 million investment made in Company C Investment C 
 Year 2: Investment A sold for 50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be 25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be 25 million 
 Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be 27 million and Investment C sold for 30 million 
 Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be 35 million 
 Year 5: Investment B sold for 20 million 
 The capital gains portion of the incentive fee, if any, would be: 
 12 

Year 1: None 
 Year 2: 5 million capital gains incentive fee 
 20 multiplied by 25 million 30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A less 5 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B) 
 Year 3: 1.4 million capital gains incentive fee (1) 
 6.4 million cumulative fee (20 multiplied by 32 million 35 million cumulative realized capital gains less 3 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less 5 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2) 
 Year 4: 0.6 million capital gains incentive fee 
 7 million cumulative fee (20 multiplied by 35 million 35 million cumulative realized capital gains without regard to 5 million of unrealized appreciation)) less 6.4 million (previous cumulative capital gains fee paid in Year 2 of 5 million and Year 3 of 1.4 million) 
 Year 5: None 
 7 million cumulative fee (20 multiplied by 35 million 35 million cumulative realized capital gains without regard to 10 million realized capital losses in subsequent year)) less 7 million (previous cumulative capital gains fee paid in Years 2, 3 and Year 4) 
 
 (1) As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 2 above, if we were to be wound up on a date other than December 31 of any year after year 3, we may have paid aggregate capital gain incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if we had been wound up on December 31 of such year. 

Organization of the Investment Adviser 
 PennantPark Investment Advisers is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or Advisers Act. The principal executive office of PennantPark Investment Advisers is located at 1691 Michigan Avenue, Miami Beach, Florida 33139. 
 Duration and Termination of Investment Management Agreement 
 The Investment Management Agreement was reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser, in May 2024. Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Management Agreement will continue in effect for a period of one year through May 2025. It will remain in effect if approved annually by our board of directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser. In determining to reapprove the Investment Management Agreement, our board of directors requested information from the Investment Adviser that enabled it to evaluate a number of factors relevant to its determination. These factors included the nature, quality and extent of services performed by the Investment Adviser, the Investment Adviser s ability to manage conflicts of interest effectively, our short and long-term performance, our costs, including as compared to comparable externally and internally managed publicly traded BDCs that engage in similar investing activities, the Investment Adviser s profitability, any economies of scale, and any other benefits of the relationship for the Investment Adviser. Based on the information reviewed and the considerations detailed above, our board of directors, including all of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided and reapproved the Investment Management Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 The Investment Management Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Management Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure We are dependent upon our Investment Adviser s key personnel for our future success, and if our Investment Adviser is unable to hire and retain qualified personnel or if our Investment Adviser loses any member of its management team, our ability to achieve our investment objectives could be significantly harmed for more information. 
 Administration Agreement 
 We have entered into an agreement, or the Administration Agreement, with the Administrator, under which the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services. Under our Administration Agreement, the Administrator performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other activities, being responsible for the financial records we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our NAV, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, technology systems, insurance and our allocable portion of the cost of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. The Administrator also offers on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies to which we are required to offer such assistance. To the extent that our Administrator outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Administrator. Reimbursement for certain of these costs is included in administrative services expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded administrative expenses of approximately 2.2 million, 1.0 million and 0.6 million, respectively. 
 
 On July 1, 2022, the Administration Agreement with the Administrator was amended to clarify that the Administrator may be reimbursed by the Company for certain (i) tax and general legal advice and/or services provided to the Company by in-house professionals of the Administrator related to ongoing operations of the Company; and (ii) transactional legal advice and/or services provided to the Company or portfolio companies by in-house professionals of the Administrator or its affiliates on matters related to potential or actual investments and transactions, including tax structuring and/or due diligence. 
 Duration and Termination of Administration Agreement

Unless terminated earlier as described below, our Administration Agreement will continue in effect for a period of one year through May 2025. It will remain in effect if approved annually by our board of directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us. The Administration Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the consent of the other party. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other.

 PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC 
 In May 2017, we and Kemper formed PSSL, an unconsolidated joint venture. PSSL invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSSL was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, PSSL had total assets of 988.1 million and 869.4 million, respectively. PSSL s portfolio consisted of investments in 109 portfolio companies as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSSL was 21.3 million and the five largest investments totaled 97.3 million. PSSL invests in portfolio companies in the same industries in which we may directly invest. As of September 30, 2023, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSSL was 18.5 million and the five largest investments totaled 83.4 million. 
 
 We provide capital to PSSL in the form of first lien secured debt and equity interests. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we and Kemper owned 87.5 and 12.5 , respectively, of each of the outstanding first lien secured debt and equity interests. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our investment made in PSSL consisted of first lien secured debt of 237.7 million (zero unfunded) and 210.1 million (additional 27.6 million unfunded), respectively, and equity interests of 101.9 million (zero unfunded) and 90.0 million (additional 11.8 million unfunded), respectively. 
 REGULATION 
 Business Development Company and Regulated Investment Company Regulations 
 We are a BDC under the 1940 Act, which has qualified and intends to continue to qualify to maintain an election to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between a BDC and its affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 We may invest up to 100 of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an underwriter as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. We may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of securities we own or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any registered investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3 of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5 of the value of our total assets in the securities of one registered investment company or invest more than 10 of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one registered investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. We may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate and currency fluctuations. None of these policies are fundamental and they may be changed without stockholder approval. 
 Qualifying Assets 
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70 of the BDC s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 
 (1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined under the 1940 Act to include any issuer which: 

(a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 

(b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but is excluded from the definition of an investment company by Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act; and 

(c) satisfies any of the following: 

(i) does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; 

(ii) has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a maximum market capitalization of 250.0 million; or 

(iii) is controlled by a BDC, either alone or as part of a group acting together, and such BDC in fact exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of such eligible portfolio company and, as a result of such control, has an affiliated person who is a director of such eligible portfolio company. 

14 

(2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. 

(3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. operating company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incidental thereto, if such issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 

(4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no readily available market for such securities and we already own 60 of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 

(5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 

(6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 

In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 As a BDC, we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies that constitute a qualifying asset within the meaning of Section 2(a)(47) of the 1940 Act. However, if a BDC purchases securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such significant managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Our Administrator may provide such assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request such assistance. Officers of our Investment Adviser and Administrator may provide assistance to controlled affiliates. 
 Temporary Investments 
 Pending investments in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70 of our assets are qualifying assets. We may invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25 of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests, as defined below under Regulation Election to be Treated as a RIC, in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we may enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
 Senior Securities 
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act and referred to as the asset coverage ratio, is compliant with the 1940 Act, immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage requirement at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to our asset coverage ratio. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure Regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital for more information. 
 Joint Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct 
 We and PennantPark Investment Advisers have adopted a joint code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and a code of conduct that establish procedures for personal immaterial investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the codes requirements. Our joint code of ethics and code of conduct are available, free of charge, on our website at www.pennantpark.com . In addition, the joint code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to this Report and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC s Internet website at www.sec.gov . 
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Investment Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our Investment Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Investment Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, we, our and us refer to our Investment Adviser. 
 Introduction 
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, we have a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of our clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients. 
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 Proxy Policies 
 We vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interests of our stockholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 Our proxy voting decisions are made by the senior investment professionals who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.

Proxy Voting Records 
 You may obtain information about how we voted proxies, free of charge, by calling us collect at (786) 297-9500 or by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Richard T. Allorto Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, 1691 Michigan Ave, Miami Beach, Florida 33139. 
 Privacy Protection Principles 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator). 
 We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Investment Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders. 
 Our privacy protection policies are available, free of charge, on our website at www.pennantpark.com . In addition, the privacy policy is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC s Internet website at www.sec.gov , filed as an exhibit to our annual report on this Form 10-K. 
 Other 
 We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. 
 We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 
 We are required by law to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person s office. 
 We and PennantPark Investment Advisers have each adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws. We review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and we designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes several regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. 
 For example: 
 pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 

pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 

pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting; and 

pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated there-under. We continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and continue to take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance with that act. 
 Election to be Treated as a RIC 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements (as described below). We also must annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the sum of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, out of the assets legally available for distribution, or the Annual Distribution Requirement. 
 In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must: 
 maintain an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 

derive in each taxable year at least 90 of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain qualified publicly traded partnerships or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, or the 90 Income Test; and 

16 

diversify our holdings, or the Diversification Tests, so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 

1) at least 50 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer neither represents more than 5 of the value of our assets nor more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 

2) no more than 25 of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in certain qualified publicly traded partnerships. 

Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (subject to certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of the excess, if any, of our capital gains over our capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year plus (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gain net income for preceding years that was not distributed during such years and on which we did not incur any federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, subject to maintaining our ability to be taxed as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity. 
 
 While we intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to avoid incurring any material U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, distribute amounts sufficient to avoid the imposition of the tax entirely. In that event, we generally will be liable for the excise tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. Under certain circumstances, however, we may, in our sole discretion, determine that it is in our best interests to retain a portion of our income or capital gains rather than distribute such amount as dividends and accordingly cause us to bear the excise tax burden associated therewith. 
 
 We may invest in partnerships which may result in our being subject to additional state, local or foreign income, franchise or other tax liabilities. In addition, some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90 Income Test. In order to mitigate the risk that such income and fees would disqualify us as a RIC as a result of a failure to satisfy the 90 Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through the Taxable Subsidiary, which is classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Taxable Subsidiary generally will be subject to corporate income taxes on its earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees. 
 Taxation as a RIC 
 If we qualify as a RIC, and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gains, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to stockholders. Additionally, upon satisfying these requirements, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any investment company taxable income or net capital gains, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, that is not distributed (or not deemed to have been distributed) as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders. 
 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold a debt instrument that is treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each taxable year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the debt instrument, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any OID accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income in the taxable year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 
 We invest in below investment grade instruments. Investments in these types of instruments may present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when we may cease to accrue interest, OID or market discount, when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless debt instruments, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income and whether exchanges of debt instruments in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. We will address these and other issues to the extent necessary in order to continue to maintain our qualification to be subject to tax as a RIC. 
 Gain or loss realized by us from equity securities and warrants acquired by us, as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants, generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 
 We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy our Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt instruments and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage requirements are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
 We may distribute our common stock as a dividend from our taxable income and a stockholder could receive a portion of such distributions declared and distributed by us in shares of our common stock with the remaining amount in cash. A stockholder will be considered to have recognized dividend income generally equal to the fair market value of the stock paid by us plus cash received with respect to such dividend. The total dividend declared and distributed by us would be taxable income to a stockholder even though only a small portion of the dividend was paid in cash to pay any taxes due on the total dividend. We have not yet elected to distribute stock as a dividend but reserve the right to do so. 
 Failure to Qualify as a RIC 
 If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, unless certain cure provisions of the Code apply, we will be subject to tax in that taxable year on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any dividend distributions to our stockholders. In that case, all of our income will be subject to corporate-level federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders. In contrast, assuming we qualify as a RIC, our corporate-level federal income tax should be substantially reduced or eliminated. See Election to be Treated as a RIC above for more information. 
 If we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we also would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would distributions be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable as dividends to our stockholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, U.S. non-corporate stockholders generally would be eligible to treat such dividends as qualified dividend income, which generally would be subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax, and dividends paid by us to certain U.S. corporate stockholders would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder s tax basis in our 
 17 

common stock, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. Moreover, if we fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, to qualify again to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to distribute our earnings and profits attributable to any of our non-RIC taxable years as dividends to our stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two consecutive taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (that is, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had sold the property at fair market value at the end of the taxable year) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five taxable years.

RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK

31 

RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR DEBT SECURITIES are not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, the 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we or our subsidiaries have currently incurred and may incur in the future (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness in order to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the 2026 Notes. As of September 30, 2024 , we had million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of Funding I, and the indebtedness under the Credit Facility is therefore effectively senior in right of payment to the 2026 Notes to the extent of the value of such assets. 
 The 2026 Notes are obligations exclusively of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is or acts as a guarantor of the 2026 Notes, and the 2026 Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future. Our secured indebtedness with respect to the Credit Facility is held through Funding I, and our secured indebtedness with respect to the 2036 Asset-Backed Debt and 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt, (collectively, the "Asset-Backed Debt") is held through the 2036 Securitization Issuer and the 2036-R Securitization Issuers, respectively. The assets of any such subsidiaries are not directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including holders of the 2026 Notes.

 Shares of BDCs may trade at a market price both above and below the NAV that is attributable to those shares. Our shares have traded above and below our NAV. Our shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange at and on September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our NAV per share was and as of the same dates. The possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount from NAV or at a premium that is unsustainable over the long term is separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV will decrease. It is not possible to predict whether our shares will trade at, above or below our NAV in the future. As of September 30, 2024 , we had 32 stockholders of record. 

 Sale of Unregistered Securities 
 We did not engage in any sales of unregistered securities during the year ended September 30, 2024. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 We did not repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase plan during the year ended September 30, 2024. 
 DISTRIBUTIONS 
 We intend to continue making monthly distributions to our stockholders. The timing and amount of our monthly distributions, if any, is determined by our board of directors. Any distributions to our stockholders are declared out of assets legally available for distribution. We monitor available net investment income to determine if a tax return of capital may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed to be a tax return of capital to our common stockholders. 
 
 In January 2025, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to stockholders subject to information reporting that will state the amount and composition of distributions and provide information with respect to appropriate tax treatment of our distributions. 
 The tax characteristics of distributions declared, in accordance with Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act, for our fiscal and taxable years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 from ordinary income (including short-term gains), if any, totaled 80.6 million, or 1.23 per share , and 60.5 million, or 1.19 per share, respectively, based on the weighted average shares outstanding for the respective periods. Additionally, for both years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not pay any distributions from long-term capital gains. 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage ratio for borrowings when applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain minimum percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.

Stock Performance Graph 
 This graph compares the return on our common stock with that of the Standard Poor s 500 Stock Index (the "S P Index") and the Russell 2000 Financial Services Index, for the last five fiscal years. The graph assumes that, on September 30, 2019, a person invested 100 in each of our common stock, the S P 500 Index, and the Russell 2000 Financial Services Index. The graph measures total stockholder return, which takes into account both changes in stock price and distributions. It assumes that distributions paid are invested in like securities.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Report, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to us and our consolidated subsidiaries regarding future events or our future performance or future financial condition. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our Company, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. The forward-looking statements contained in this Report involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to: 
 
 our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our prospective portfolio companies; 

changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets that could result in changes to the value of our assets; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 

the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our business; 

the impact of investments that we expect to make; 

the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our business and our portfolio companies; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the valuation of our investments in portfolio companies, particularly those having no liquid trading market; 

the ability of our prospective portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our expected financings and investments and ability to fund capital commitments to PSSL; 

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our prospective portfolio companies; 

the impact of price and volume fluctuations in the stock market; 

increasing levels of inflation, and its impact on us and our portfolio companies; 

the ability of our Investment Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the impact of future legislation and regulation on our business and our portfolio companies; 

the impact of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia other world economic and political issues; and 

the inability to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. 

We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, intends, seeks, plans, estimates and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. You should not place undue influence on the forward-looking statements as our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Report. 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. 
 We have based the forward-looking statements included in this Report on information available to us on the date of this Report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in this Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including reports on Form 10-Q/K and current reports on Form 8-K. 
 You should understand that under Section 27A(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to forward-looking statements made in periodic reports we file under the Exchange Act. 
 The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. 
 Overview 

43 

Organization and Structure of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. 
 PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd., a Maryland corporation organized in October 2010, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. 
 Our investment activities are managed by the Investment Adviser. Under our Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Investment Adviser an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. We have also entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under our Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. Our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of us, provides overall supervision of our activities, and the Investment Adviser supervises our day-to-day activities. 
 
 At-the-Market Offering 
 
 On August 20, 2021, we entered into equity distribution agreements with each of JMP Securities LLC and Raymond James Associates, Inc., as the sales agents, in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock, with an aggregate offering price of up to 75 million under an at-the-market offering. The equity distribution agreements provide that we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through a sales agent in amounts and at times to be determined by us. On May 5, 2022, we amended the equity distribution agreements to update references from NASDAQ to NYSE and reflect that the agents are now represented by Kirkland Ellis LLP. On March 27, 2023 we terminated the equity distribution agreements and entered into new equity distribution agreements with Citizens JMP Securities LLC, Raymond James Associates, Inc. and Truist Securities, Inc. (together, the "Prior Equity Distribution Agreements"), as sales agents (each,as "Sales Agent," and together, the "Sales Agents") in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock, with an aggregate offering price of up to 100 million under an ATM program. On August 11, 2023, we amended the Prior Equity Distribution Agreements with each of the Sales Agents (together, the Amended and Restated Equity Distribution Agreements to increase the aggregate offering price to up to 250 million. On July 17, 2024 we terminated the existing equity distribution agreements and entered into new equity distribution agreements with the Sales Agents (together, the "Equity Distribution Agreements") in connection with the sale of our shares of common stock with an aggregate offering price of up to 500 million under an ATM Program ("ATM Program"). The Equity Distribution Agreements provide that we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through a Sales Agent in amounts and at times to be determined by us. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, market conditions and the trading price of our common stock. The Investment Adviser may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, pay some or all of the commissions payable under the Equity Distribution Agreements or make additional supplemental payments to ensure that the sales price per share of our common stock in connection with all of the offerings made hereunder will not be less than our current NAV per share. Any such payments made by the Investment Adviser will not be subject to reimbursement by us. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities we hold and capital gains and dividends, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt or subordinated debt, typically have a term of three to ten years and bear interest at a floating or fixed rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees. Loan origination fees, OID and market discount or premium are capitalized and accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which may or may not be non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees and agency fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned. Litigation settlements are accounted for in accordance with the gain contingency provisions of ASC Subtopic 450-30, Gain Contingencies, or ASC 450-30. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of a management fee and the payment of an incentive fee to our Investment Adviser, if any, our allocable portion of overhead under our Administration Agreement and other operating costs as detailed below. Our management fee compensates our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, consummating and monitoring our investments. Additionally, we pay interest expense on the outstanding debt and unused commitment fees on undrawn amounts under our various debt facilities. We bear all other direct or indirect costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including: 
 the cost of calculating our NAV, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 

the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; 

fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments or complementary businesses; 

44 

expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing due diligence and reviews of investments, including expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser payable to third parties (including agents and consultants) in monitoring financial and legal affairs for the Company and in monitoring the Company s investments; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 

federal and state registration fees and any exchange listing fees; 

federal, state, local and foreign taxes; 

independent directors fees and expenses; 

brokerage commissions; 

fidelity bond, directors and officers, errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 

direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; 

fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; 

costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; and 

all other expenses incurred by either the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under our Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead, and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. 

Generally, during periods of asset growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive to the expenses described above.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements have been included. Actual results could differ from these estimates due to changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates and assumptions. We may reclassify certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. We have eliminated all intercompany 
 45 

balances and transactions. References to ASC serve as a single source of accounting literature. Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Investment Valuations 
 We expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of our investments which are or will be in our portfolio, and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process, as described in this Report. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the board of directors may take into account in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and the difference may be material. 
 Our portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 (1) Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment; 

(2) Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of our Investment Adviser; 

(3) Our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. The independent valuation firms review management s preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service, broker, dealer or market maker; 

(4) The audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of our Investment Adviser and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis, periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms, and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and 

(5) Our board of directors discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee. 

Our board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available. We obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available, or otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. The Investment Adviser assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 Fair value, as defined under ASC 820, is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date. 
 ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies: 
 Level 1: Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. 
 Level 2: Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term, if applicable, of the financial instrument. 
 Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. 
 
 A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments, our 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt, 2036 Asset-Backed Debt and the Credit Facility are classified as Level 3. Our 2023 Notes and 2026 Notes are classified as Level 2 as they are financial instruments with readily observable market inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material. 
 
 On December 3, 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which establishes an updated regulatory framework for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. The new rule clarifies how fund boards of directors can satisfy their valuation obligations and requires, among other things, the board of directors to periodically assess material valuation risks and take steps to manage those risks. The rule also permit boards of directors, subject to board oversight and certain other conditions, to designate the fund s investment adviser to perform fair value determinations. The new rule went into effect on March 8, 2021 and had a compliance date of September 8, 2022. We came into compliance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act before the compliance date. While our board of directors has not elected to designate the Investment Adviser as the valuation designee at this time, we have adopted certain revisions to our valuation policies and procedures in order comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. 
 
 In addition to using the above inputs to value cash equivalents, investments, our 2023 Notes, our 2026 Notes, our 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, our 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt, our 2036 Asset-Backed Debt and the Credit Facility, we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value.

Generally, the carrying value of our consolidated financial liabilities approximates fair value. We have adopted the principles ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments, or ASC 825-10, which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and made an irrevocable election to apply ASC 825-10 to the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes. We elected to use the fair value option for the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. Due to that election and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of 6.5 million and zero relating to amendment costs on the Credit Facility and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. ASC 825-10 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect on earnings of a company s choice to use fair value. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and changes in fair value of the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We elected not to apply ASC 825-10 to any other financial assets or liabilities, including the 2026 Notes, the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt and the 2036 Asset-Backed Debt. 
 
 For the years September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Credit Facility or our Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, the 2023 Notes had a net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of approximately zero and (2.3) million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net unrealized depreciation on the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes totaled approximately zero and zero, respectively. We use a nationally recognized independent valuation service to measure the fair value of the Credit Facility and 2023 Notes in a manner consistent with the valuation process that our board of directors uses to value our investments. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will generally not accrue PIK interest when the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectable. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, OID, market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and then accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. We record prepayment penalties on loans and debt investments as income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned. 
 Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments, the Credit Facility, the 2023 Notes during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 
 Foreign Currency Translation 
 Our books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis: 
 1. Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable period; and 

2. Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. 

Although net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, we do not isolate that portion of the results of operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates on investments, other assets and debt from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair value of investments and liabilities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments and liabilities. 
 Payment-in-kind, or PIK, Interest 
 We have investments in our portfolio which contain a PIK interest provision. PIK interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income. In order for us to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even though we may not have collected any cash with respect to interest on PIK securities. 
 Federal Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements. We also must annually distribute dividends for federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. 
 
 Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the s um of (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (subject to certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gain net income (i.e., the excess, if any, of our capital gains over capital losses), adjusted for certain ordinary losses, generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year plus (3) any net ordinary income or capital gain net income for the preceding years that was not distributed during such years on which we did not incur any corporate income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, subject to maintaining our ability to be taxed as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity. 
 
 Because federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized gain recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences between tax regulations and GAAP may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded a provision for taxes on net investment income of 1.1 million, 1.0 million, and 0.4 million, respectively, pertaining to federal excise tax. 
 47 

The Taxable Subsidiary is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. The income tax expense and related tax liabilities of the Taxable Subsidiary are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized a provision for taxes of (0.1) million, (2.8) million and 4.6 million, respectively, on unrealized appreciation on investments by the Taxable Subsidiary. The provision for taxes on unrealized appreciation on investments is the result of netting (i) the expected tax liability on gains from sales of investments and (ii) the expected tax benefit from the use of losses in the current year. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, 1.7 million and 1.8 million, respectively, was accrued as a deferred tax liability on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities relating to unrealized gain on investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, of 0.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively, the Company recognized a provision for taxes on realized gain on investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the Company paid zero, zero, and 1.2 million, respectively, in federal taxes on realized gains on the sale of investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary. The state and local tax liability of zero as of September 30, 2024 is included under accrued other expenses in the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities. 
 The Taxable Subsidiary, which is subject to tax as a corporation, allows us to hold equity securities of certain portfolio companies treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes while facilitating our ability to qualify as a RIC under the Code. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Set forth below are the results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For information regarding results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2022, see the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as filed with the SEC on December 8, 2023. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income for the year ended September 30, 2024 was 186.4 million and was attributable to 164.3 million from first lien secured debt and 22.1 million from other investments. The increase in investment income compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the size of the debt portfolio. 
 Investment income for the year ended September 30, 2023 was 139.3 million and was attributable to 120.0 million from first lien secured debt and 19.3 million from other investments.

 Expenses for the year ended September 30, 2024 totaled 108.6 million base management fee totaled 14.9 million, incentive fee totaled 18.1 million, debt related interest and expenses totaled 67.9 million, general and administrative expenses totaled 6.7 million and provision for taxes totaled 1.1 million. The increase in expenses compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in debt related interest and expenses and incentive fees. 
 Expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 totaled 71.8 million. Base management fee totaled 11.4 million, incentive fee totaled 16.9 million, debt related interest and expenses totaled 38.2 million, general and administrative expenses totaled 4.4 million and provision for taxes totaled 1.0 million. 
 Net Investment Income 
 
 Net investment income totaled 77.7 million, or 1.18 per share, and 67.5 million, or 1.33 per share, for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net investment income compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the size of our debt portfolio. 
 Net Realized Gains or Losses 
 Sales and repayments of investments for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 514.1 million and 399.1 million, respectively. Net realized gain (losses) on investments totaled 0.2 million and (15.9) million for the same periods, respectively. The change in realized gains (losses) was primarily due to changes in market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, caused by the fluctuations in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under Forward-Looking Statements . 
 Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments, the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes 
 For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of 14.3 million and 12.6) million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments totaled (11.4) million and (25.7) million, respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on our investments for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, caused by the fluctuations in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under the Forward-Looking Statements" section above. 
 For the year ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Credit Facility or Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, and the 2023 Notes had a net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of less than (0.1) million and (2.3) million and, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net unrealized (appreciation) depreciation on the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes totaled zero and zero, respectively. The net change in unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital markets, with the economic instability negatively affecting the value, as further discussed above under Forward-Looking Statements . 
 48 

Net Change in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
 Net change in net assets resulting from operations totaled 91.8 million, or 1.40 per share, and 39.3 million, or 0.77 per share, for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net assets from operations for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily due to less depreciation of the portfolio primarily driven by changes in market conditions of our investments along with the change in size and cost yield of our debt portfolio and costs of financing, as discussed above under Forward-Looking Statements as well as higher investment income. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds of securities offerings, debt capital and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. As of September 30, 2024, in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that we are in compliance with a 150 asset coverage ratio requirement after such borrowing. For information regarding liquidity and capital resources for the year ended September 30, 2022, see the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as filed with the SEC on December 8, 2023. 
 
 On April 5, 2018, our board of directors approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the SBCAA). As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200 (i.e., 1 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity) to 150 (i.e., 2 of debt outstanding for each 1 of equity), effective as of April 5, 2019, subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 174 and 230 , respectively. 
 
 The annualized weighted average cost of debt for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, inclusive of the fee on the undrawn commitment on the Credit Facility or Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, amendment costs and debt issuance costs, was 8.5 and 6.2 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 192.1 million and 376.6 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. 
 
 Funding I s multi-currency Credit Facility with the Lenders upsized during the year increasing the facility to 636.0 million as of September 30, 2024, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC, has an interest rate spread above SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) of 225 basis points, a maturity date of August 2029 and a revolving period that ends in August 2027.

The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 7.5 and 7.7 , exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 During the revolving period, the Credit Facility bears interest at SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 225 basis points and, after the revolving period, the rate will reset to Base Rate (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 250 basis points for the remaining two years, maturing in August 2029. The Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets of Funding I. Both PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. and Funding I have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. 
 The Credit Facility contains covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions of loan size, currency types and amounts, industry requirements, average life of loans, geographic and individual portfolio concentrations, minimum portfolio yield and loan payment frequency. Additionally, the Credit Facility requires the maintenance of a minimum equity investment in Funding I and income ratio as well as restrictions on certain payments and issuance of debt. The Credit Facility compliance reporting is prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants relating to the Credit Facility. 
 We own 100 of the equity interest in Funding I and treat the indebtedness of Funding I as our leverage. Our Investment Adviser serves as collateral manager to Funding I under the Credit Facility. 
 Our interest in Funding I (other than the management fee) is subordinate in priority of payment to every other obligation of Funding I and is subject to certain payment restrictions set forth in the Credit Facility. We may receive cash distributions on our equity interests in Funding I only after it has made (1) all required cash interest and, if applicable, principal payments to the Lenders, (2) required administrative expenses and (3) claims of other unsecured creditors of Funding I. We cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds available to make any distributions to us or that such distributions will meet our expectations from Funding I. The Investment Adviser has irrevocably directed that the management fee owed with respect to such services is to be paid to the Company so long as the Investment Adviser remains the collateral manager.

 On August 20, 2021, we entered into equity distribution agreements with each of JMP Securities LLC and Raymond James Associates, Inc., as the sales agents, in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock, with an aggregate offering price of up to 75 million under an at-the-market offering. The equity distribution agreements provide that we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through a sales agent in amounts and at times to be determined by us. On May 5, 2022, we amended the equity distribution agreements to update references from NASDAQ to NYSE and reflect that the agents are now represented by Kirkland Ellis LLP. On March 27, 2023 we terminated the equity distribution agreements and entered into new equity distribution agreements with Citizens JMP Securities LLC, Raymond James Associates, Inc. and Truist Securities, Inc. (together, the "Prior Equity Distribution Agreements"), as sales agents (each, as "Sales Agent," and together, the "Sales Agents") in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock, with an aggregate offering price of up to 100 million under an ATM program. On August 11, 2023, we amended the Prior Equity Distribution Agreements with each of the Sales Agents (together, the Amended and Restated Equity Distribution Agreements to increase the aggregate offering price to up to 250 million. On July 17, 2024 we terminated the existing equity distribution agreements and entered into new equity distribution agreements with the Sales Agents (together, the "Equity Distribution Agreements") in connection with the sale of our shares of common stock with an aggregate offering price of up to 500 million under an ATM Program ("ATM Program"). The Equity Distribution Agreements provide that we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through a Sales Agent in amounts and at times to be determined by us. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, market conditions and the trading price of our common stock. The Investment Adviser may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, pay some or all of the commissions payable under the Equity Distribution Agreements or make additional supplemental payments to ensure that the sales price per share of our common stock in connection with all of the offerings made hereunder will not be less than our current NAV per share. Any such payments made by the Investment Adviser will not be subject to reimbursement by us. 
 
 During the years ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 we issued 18,845,194 and 9,089,064 shares of our Common Stock, respectively, under ATM Programs at an average price of 11.35 and 11.03 per share, respectively, raising 213.3 million and 100.2 million of net proceeds after commissions to the sales agents and inclusive of proceeds from the Investment Adviser to ensure that all shares were sold at or above NAV. We incurred 0.8 million and 0.5 million, respectively, of deferred offering costs incurred related to establishing the ATM Programs. As of September 30, 2024, and 2023, we had 437.3 million and 154.1 million available under the ATM Programs. 
 
 Since inception of the ATM Programs through September 30, 2024, we issued 27,848,081 shares of our Common Stock under the ATM Programs at a weighted-average price of 11.22, raising 312.5 million of net proceeds after commissions to the sales agents and inclusive of proceeds from the Investment Adviser to ensure that all shares were sold at or above NAV. We incurred 1.2 million of legal and other offering costs associated with establishing the ATM Programs. 
 We may raise equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off our shelf registration statement and private offerings of securities, securitizing a portion of our investments among other considerations or mergers and acquisitions. Furthermore, the Credit Facility availability depends on various covenants and restrictions as discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes. 
 We have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under our Investment Management Agreement, which was most recently reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser, in February 2023, PennantPark Investment Advisers serves as our investment adviser. Payments under our Investment Management Agreement in each reporting period are equal to (1) a management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our average adjusted gross assets and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance. 
 Under our Administration Agreement, which was most recently reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, in May 2024, the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administration Agreement was amended on July 1, 2022. If requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, we or the Administrator will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided. Payment under our Administration Agreement is based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. 
 If any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had cash equivalents of 112.1 million and 100.6 million, respectively, available for investing and general corporate purposes. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities. 
 Our operating activities used cash of 801.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, and our financing activities provided cash of 812.9 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily from proceeds from ATM program, borrowing under our Credit Facility and issuances of asset-backed debt. 
 
 Our operating activities provided cash of 140.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, and our financing activities used cash of 91.5 million for the same period.

The spread may change based on the type of rate used. The terms in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments disclose the actual interest rate in effect as of the reporting period. LIBOR loans are typically indexed to a 30-day, 60-day, 90-day or 180-day SOFR rate (1M S, 2M S, 3M S, or 6M S, respectively), at the borrower s option. All securities are subject to a SOFR or Prime rate floor where a spread is provided, unless noted. The spread provided includes PIK interest and other fee rates, if any.

Distributions 
 In order to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and to not be subject to corporate-level tax on undistributed income or gains, we are required, under Subchapter M of the Code, to annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. 
 
 Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, subject to maintaining our ability to be taxed as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity. 
 During the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we declared distributions of 1.23 per share and 1.19 per share, respectively, for total distributions of 80.6 million and 60.5 million, respectively. We monitor available net investment income to determine if a return of capital for tax purposes may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, stockholders will be notified of the portion of those distributions deemed to be a tax return of capital. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders subject to information reporting on Form 1099-DIV after the end of each calendar year and in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. 
 We intend to continue to make monthly distributions to our stockholders. Our monthly distributions, if any, are determined by our board of directors quarterly. 
 
 On November 22, 2017, we terminated our dividend reinvestment plan. The termination of the plan applies to the reinvestment of cash distributions paid on or after December 22, 2017. 
 58 

We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage ratio for borrowings applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute at least a certain percentage of our income annually, we could suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions at a particular level. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The FASB approved an (optional) two year extension to December 31, 2024, for transitioning away from LIBOR. The Company adopted ASU 2020-04, the effect of which was not material to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
 In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which is intended to address issues identified during the post-implementation review of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The amendment, among other things, eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors , while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has adopted the new accounting standard implementing appropriate controls and procedures, the effect which was not material to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03, or ASU, 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, or ASU 2022-03, which changed the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. The amendments clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the impact of the adoption is not expected to be material. 
 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 expands public entities' segment disclosure by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items and interim disclosure of a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets. All disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 are required for entities with a single reportable segment. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods for our fiscal years beginning December 15, 2024, and should be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented, noting early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 09 "Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" ("ASU 2023 - 09"). ASU 2023 - 09 intends to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023 - 09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and is to be adopted on a prospective basis with the option to apply retrospectively. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance, however, we do not expect a material impact to our financial statements.

Item 7A.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, our debt portfolio consisted of approximately 100 variable-rate investments. The variable-rate loans are usually based on a SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) rate and typically have durations of three months, after which they reset to current market interest rates. Variable-rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to nine months only if the index exceeds the floor. In regards to variable-rate instruments with a floor, we do not benefit from increases in interest rates until such rates exceed the floor and thereafter benefit from market rates above any such floor. In contrast, our cost of funds, to the extent it is not fixed, will fluctuate with changes in interest rates since it has no floor. 
 Assuming that the most recent Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities was to remain constant, and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates: 

Change in Interest Rates 
 
 Change in Interest Income, Net of Interest Expense (in thousands) 

Change in Interest Income, Net of Interest Expense Per Share 

Down 1 

(7,730) 

(0.10) 

Up 1 

7,730 

0.10 

Up 2

0.20 

Up 3 

23,190 

0.30 

Up 4 

30,938 

0.40 

Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations or net investment income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from those shown above. 
 Because we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds, as well as our level of leverage. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income or net assets. 
 We may hedge against interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts or the Credit Facility subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currencies, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates or higher exchange rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates or investments denominated in foreign currencies. During the periods covered by this Report, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities or foreign currency derivatives hedging activities.

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The management of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital, Ltd. (except where the context suggests otherwise, the terms we, us, our and PennantPark Floating refer to PennantPark Floating Rate Capital, Ltd. and its Subsidiaries) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. Our internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 
 PennantPark Floating s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions recorded necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our policies and procedures also provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of PennantPark Floating, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of PennantPark Floating s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on such assessment management has determined that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. and Subsidiaries 
 
 Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements) of the Company and our report dated November 25, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. and Subsidiaries 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, by correspondence with the custodians, underlying fund advisors, and by other appropriate auditing procedures. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

 The fair value of the Company s investments valued using Level 3 fair value measurements was approximately 1,917.8 million as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of the Company s financial instruments classified as liabilities valued using Level 3 fair value measurements was approximately 443.9 million as of September 30, 2024. As discussed in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s investment portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments, which were acquired directly from the issuer. Such investments include first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments. Additionally, the Company has elected to apply the fair value option to certain financial instruments classified as liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. 
 
 We identified Level 3 fair value measurements as a critical audit matter due to the subjective nature of the judgments necessary for management to select valuation techniques and the use of significant unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value. Auditing the reasonableness of management s selection of valuation technique and the related unobservable inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort, including the use of a valuation specialist. 
 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following, among others: 
 
 We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to management s valuation of Level 3 fair value measurements, including those related to valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness. 

With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the selected valuation techniques, and any changes to selected valuation techniques from prior periods, used for Level 3 fair value measurements. For a sample of investments, we evaluated both the reasonableness of the significant unobservable inputs and the reasonableness of any significant changes in significant unobservable inputs from prior periods, when applicable, by comparing the unobservable inputs to external sources, including, but not limited to: 

Historical operating results of the investee. 

Available market data for comparable companies. 

Subsequent events and transactions, where available. 

We tested both the source information used to determine the unobservable input and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation used to compute the unobservable input for a sample of investments. 
 
 /s/ 
 
 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2013.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 
 of the value of our managed assets will be invested in floating rate loans and other investments bearing a variable rate of interest, which may include, from time to time, variable rate derivative instruments. We generally expect that first lien secured debt will represent at least of our overall portfolio. We generally expect to invest up to of our overall portfolio opportunistically in other types of investments, including second lien secured debt, subordinated debt, and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. We execute our investment strategy directly and through our wholly owned subsidiaries, our unconsolidated joint venture and unconsolidated limited partnership. The term "subsidiary" means entities that primarily engage in investment activities in securities or other assets are wholly owned by us. The Company does not intend to create or acquire primary control of an entity which primarily engages in investment activities of securities or other assets other than entities wholly owned by the Company. We comply with the provisions of Section 17 of the 1940 Act related to affiliated transactions and custody. To the extent that the Company forms a subsidiary advised by an investment adviser other than the Investment Adviser, the investment adviser to such subsidiaries will comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act relating to investment advisory contracts, including but not limited to, Section 15, as if it were an investment adviser to the Company under Section 2(a)(20) of the 1940 Act. We have entered into an investment management agreement, or the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, an external adviser that manages our day-to-day operations. We have also entered into an administration agreement, or the Administration Agreement with the Administrator, which provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Funding I, our wholly-owned subsidiary and a special purpose entity, was organized in Delaware as a limited liability company in May 2011. We formed Funding I in order to establish the Credit Facility. The Investment Adviser serves as the collateral manager to Funding I and has irrevocably directed that the management fee owed with respect to such services is to be paid to us so long as the Investment Adviser remains the collateral manager. This arrangement does not increase our consolidated management fee. The Credit Facility allows Funding I to borrow up to million at SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus basis points during the revolving period. The Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets held by Funding I. See Note 11. We have formed and expect to continue to form certain taxable subsidiaries, including the Taxable Subsidiary, which are subject to tax as corporations. These taxable subsidiaries allow us to hold equity securities of certain portfolio companies treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes while facilitating our ability to qualify as a RIC under the Code. In May 2017, we and Kemper formed PSSL, an unconsolidated joint venture. PSSL invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSSL was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. See Note 4. In November 2017, we issued million of our 2023 Notes. The principal on the 2023 Notes were payable in as follows: of the original principal amount on December 15, 2020, of the original principal amount on December 15, 2021, of the original principal amount on December 15, 2022 and on December 15, 2023. On December 15, 2023, the remaining outstanding 2023 Notes were repaid in full. The 2023 Notes were general, unsecured obligations and ranked equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2023 Notes were listed on the TASE and, in connection with this offering, we dual listed our common stock on the TASE. On February 7, 2024 the Company filed a notice with the Israel Securities Authority and the TASE voluntarily requesting to de-list the Company's common stock from trading on the TASE. The last day of trading on the TASE was May 6, 2024 and the de-listing of the Company's common stock from the TASE took effect on May 8, 2024. In September 2019, the Securitization Issuers completed the Debt Securitization. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio of the Securitization Issuer consisting primarily of middle market loans and participation interests in middle market loans. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature on October 15, 2031. On the closing date of the Debt Securitization, in consideration of our transfer to the Securitization Issuer of the initial closing date loan portfolio, which included loans distributed to us by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Securitization Issuer transferred to us of the Preferred Shares of the Securitization Issuer, of the Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes issued by the Securitization Issuer, and a portion of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt. See Note 11. In July 2024, the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt was refinanced through a million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation, or the "2036-R Asset-Backed Debt". The Company retained million of the debt securitization. The 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio of primarily middle market loans and participation interest in middle market loans. The 2036-R Asset Backed Debt is schedule to mature in July 2036. On February 22, 2024, the 2036 Securitization Issuer completed the 2036 Securitization. The 2036 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio of the 2036-Securitization Issuer consisting primarily of middle market loans and participation interests in middle market loans. The 2036 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature in April 2036. On the closing date of the 2036 Securitization, in consideration of our transfer to the 2036 Securitization Issuer of the initial closing date loan portfolio, which included loans distributed to us by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. See Note 11. In March 2021 and October 2021, we issued million and million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a public offering price per note of and respectively. Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid on April 1 and October 1 of each year, at a rate of per year, commencing October 1, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system.

 million, million and million, respectively, pertaining to federal excise tax. We recognize the effect of a tax position in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with ASC 740 when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not considered to satisfy the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense or benefit. Penalties or interest, if applicable, that may be assessed relating to income taxes would be classified as other operating expenses in the financial statements. There were no tax accruals relating to uncertain tax positions and no amounts accrued for any related interest or penalties with respect to the periods presented herein. The Company s determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an ongoing analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although the Company files both federal and state income tax returns, the Company s major tax jurisdiction is federal.

of our average adjusted gross assets, which equals our gross assets (net of U.S. Treasury Bills, temporary draws under any credit facility, cash and cash equivalents, repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions undertaken at the end of a fiscal quarter for purposes of preserving investment flexibility for the next quarter and unfunded commitments, if any) and is payable quarterly in arrears. For example, if we sold shares on the 45th day of a quarter and did not use the proceeds from the sale to repay outstanding indebtedness, our gross assets for such quarter would give effect to the net proceeds of the issuance for only 45 days of the quarter during which the additional shares were outstanding. For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded a base management fee expense of million, million, and million, respectively. Incentive Fee The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: One part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income, including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as amendment, commitment, origination, prepayment penalties, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees received from portfolio companies, accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense or amendment fees under any credit facility and distribution paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a percentage of the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized). incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of , (2) of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than in any calendar quarter annualized) (we refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle but is less than as the catch-up, which is meant to provide our Investment Adviser with of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, as if a hurdle did not apply, if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter), and (3) of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter. These calculations are pro-rated for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter, if applicable. For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded incentive fees on net investment income of earned million, million, and million, respectively. The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date) and equals of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 , the Company did t record an incentive fee on capital gains as calculated under the Investment Management Agreement (as described above). Under GAAP, we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized capital gains and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the capital gains incentive fee accrual, we considered the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then we record a capital gains incentive fee equal to of such amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains related to incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such year. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. The incentive fee accrued for but, not payable, under GAAP on our unrealized and realized capital gains for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was zero, respectively.

As of September 30, 2023, we did not have any outstanding non-U.S. dollar borrowings on the Credit Facility. Generally, the carrying value of our consolidated financial liabilities approximates fair value. We have adopted the principles under ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments, or ASC 825-10 , which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and made an irrevocable election to apply ASC 825-10 to the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes. We elected to use the fair value option for the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. Due to that election and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of million, , and relating to amendment costs on the Credit Facility and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes during the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. ASC 825-10 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect on earnings of a company s choice to use fair value. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and changes in fair value of the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We elected not to apply ASC 825-10 to any other financial assets or liabilities, including our 2026 Notes, 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, 2036-R Asset-Backed Debt, and 2036 Asset-Backed Debt. For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 , the Credit Facility or our Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, the 2023 Notes had a net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of approximately zero, million, and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the net unrealized depreciation on

 As of September 30, 2024, we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 
 (b) Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, which appears on page [60] of this Form 10-K, is incorporated by reference herein. 
 (c) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, management remediated the material weakness previously identified as of September 30, 2023 relating to (a) the operation of our internal controls relating to the quarterly cash and investment reconciliations and (b) in the operating of our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our review of interest income and non-accrual classification of investments. Although this material weakness did not result in any material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements, there is a possibility it could have led to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures that were not prevented or detected. 
 
 Management remediated the material weaknesses identified as of September 30, 2023 by enhancing (a) the appropriate review of the quarterly cash and investment reconciliation and that it is adequately documented so as to provide evidence that the controls are operating effectively, (b) existing controls to ensure that our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our analysis of interest income and assessment of investments for classification as non-accrual investments are operating effectively and (c) policies and procedures to demonstrate a commitment to improving our overall control environment. 
 
 As a result of the remediation activities, management has determined that management s controls were designed appropriately and at a sufficient level of precision, and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time, such that the material weakness previously identified as of September 30, 2023 has been remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 Except as noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Independent Auditor s Report 

Board of Directors 
 PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC 

Opinion 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC and its subsidiaries (the Fund), which comprise the consolidated statements of assets, liabilities and members equity, including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in members equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). 
 
 In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations, changes in members equity and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
 
 Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 
 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
 In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. 
 
 Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 
 1 

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 
 
 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

PSSL is a joint venture between PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. PFLT and Trinity Universal Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Kemper Corporation (NYSE: KMPR), Kemper ). In this report, except where the context suggests otherwise, the terms Company, we, our, or us refer to PSSL and its consolidated subsidiary. 
 
 The Company's investment objectives are to generate current income and capital appreciation while seeking to preserve capital. We seek to achieve our investment objective by investing primarily in loans bearing a variable-rate of interest, or floating rate loans, and other investments made to U.S. middle-market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade. Floating rate loans pay interest at variable rates, which are determined periodically, on the basis of a floating base lending rate such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), with or without a floor, plus a fixed spread. 
 
 PFLT and Kemper (individually a Member and collectively the Members provide capital to PSSL in the form of notes and equity interests. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, PFLT and Kemper owned 87.5 and 12.5 , respectively, of each of the outstanding notes and equity interests. The administrative agent of the Company is PennantPark Investment Administration, LLC, (the Administrative Agent ).

All material decisions with respect to PSSL, including those involving its investment portfolio, require unanimous approval of a quorum of the board of directors or investment committee. Quorum is defined as (i) the presence of two members of the board of directors or investment committee; provided that at least one individual is present that was elected, designated or appointed by each of the Members; (ii) the presence of three members of the board of directors or investment committee, provided that the individual that was elected, designated or appointed by the Member with only one individual present shall be entitled to cast two votes on each matter; and (iii) the presence of four members of the board of directors or investment committee shall constitute a quorum, provided that two individuals are present that were elected, designated or appointed by each of the Members. 
 
 Pennant Park Senior Secured Loan Facility II, LLC PSSL II ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSSL, was formed in January 2021 for the purpose of entering into a senior secured revolving credit facility with Ally Bank (see Note 10).

 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 PSSL is considered an investment company under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting guidance applicable to investment companies in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946. References to the Accounting Standards Codification, as amended ASC ), serves as a source of accounting literature. Subsequent events are evaluated and recognized or disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. In the opinion of the Company, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements have been included. Actual results could differ from these estimates due to changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates and assumptions. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

12 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 Our significant accounting policies consistently applied are as follows: 
 
 (a) Investment Valuations 
 
 We expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of our investments, which are or will be in our portfolio, and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy, described herein, and a consistently applied valuation process. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the board of directors may consider in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event in determining our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and the difference may be material. See Note 4. 
 
 Our portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 	 
 (1) Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC, the investment adviser to PFLT, responsible for the portfolio investment; 

(2) Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC; 

(3) Our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. The independent valuation firms review PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC s preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service, broker, dealer or market maker; 

(4) Our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis, periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms, and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and 

(5) Our board of directors assesses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC and the respective independent valuation firms. 

Our board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available. We obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available, or otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 
 (b) Security Transactions, Revenue Recognition, and Realized/Unrealized Gains or Losses 
 
 Security transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt investments with contractual payment-in-kind, or PIK interest, which represents interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will generally not accrue PIK interest when the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectable. We do not accrue as a receivable, interest on loans and debt investments if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount OID ), market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and then accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as 
 13 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 interest expense. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned. 
 
 Loans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more and/or if there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest receivable is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the Company judgment. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in the Company judgment, are likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2024, we had two portfolio companies on non-accrual, representing 2.0 and 1.0 of our overall portfolio on a cost and fair value basis. As of September 30, 2023, we had two portfolio companies on non-accrual, representing 1.5 and 0.3 of our overall portfolio on a cost and fair value basis. 
 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 
 
 (c) Income Taxes 
 
 PSSL is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Accordingly, no provisions for U.S. income taxes have been made. The Members are responsible for reporting their share of the PSSL s income or loss on their U.S. income tax returns. 
 
 In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, the Company is required to determine whether a tax position of PSSL is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in PSSL recording a tax liability that would reduce members capital. 
 
 As of and for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, management has determined that there were no material uncertain income tax positions. 
 
 (d) Foreign Currency Translation 
 
 Our books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis: 
 
 1. Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable period; and 

2. Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. 

Although Members capital and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, we do not isolate that portion of the results of operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates on investments, other assets and debt from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments. 
 
 Foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and U.S. government securities. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices to be more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities. 

14 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

(e) Consolidation 
 
 As explained by ASC paragraph 946-810-45, PSSL will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to us. 
 
 (f) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting or ASU 2020-04. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company utilized the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the year ended September 30, 2023, the effect of which was not material to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, or ASU 2022-03, which changed the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. The amendments clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the impact of the adoption is not expected to be material. 
 
 3. AGREEMENTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 
 On June 10, 2022, the Company issued a capital call to PFLT totaling 28.4 million consisting of Member notes of 19.9 million and equity interest of 8.5 million. PFLT fulfilled the capital call by contributing 28.0 million of securities and 0.4 million in cash to the Company. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, PSSL purchased 253.6 million and 158.2 million, in investments from PFLT, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, PSSL had a receivable from PFLT of none and and 0.4 million, respectively, 
 presented as a due from affiliate on the consolidated statements of assets, liabilities and members' equity. These amounts are related to cash owed to PSSL from PFLT in connection with trades between funds. Additionally, PSSL had a receivable from the Administrative Agent of 0.1 million as of September 30, 2024 related to loan agency fees received by the Administrative Agent and owed to PSSL. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, PSSL incurred 2.4 million and 2.1 million of administration fees to the Administrative Agent, respectively. The Administrative Agent provides administration services to PSSL at an annual rate of 0.25 of average gross assets payable quarterly in arrears and calculated based on average gross assets measured at cost at the end of the two recently completed calendar quarters. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, PSSL incurred 34.2 million and 30.3 million of interest expense related to the notes outstanding with the Members, respectively. 

4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
 Fair value, as defined under ASC 820, is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including 
 15 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date. 
 
 ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies: 
 
 Level 1:	Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. 
 
 Level 2:	Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term, if applicable, of the financial instrument. 
 
 Level 3:	Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. 
 
 A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments are classified as Level 3. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material. 
 
 The inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data is available, such information may be the result of consensus pricing information, disorderly transactions or broker quotes which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification as Level 3 information, assuming no additional corroborating evidence were available. Corroborating evidence that would result in classifying these non-binding broker/dealer bids as a Level 2 asset includes observable market-based transactions for the same or similar assets or other relevant observable market-based inputs that may be used in pricing an asset. 
 
 Our investments are generally structured as debt in the form of first lien secured debt, but may also include second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments. The transaction price, excluding transaction costs, is typically the best estimate of fair value at inception. Ongoing reviews by the Members and independent valuation firms are based on an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties, expected cash flows and market-based information including comparable transactions, performance multiples and yields, among other factors. These non-public investments using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in our ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. 
 
 In addition to using the above inputs in valuing cash equivalents and investments, we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value. See Note 2. 
 
 As outlined in the table below, some of our Level 3 investments using a market comparable valuation technique are valued using the average of the bids from brokers or dealers. The bids include a disclaimer, may not have corroborating evidence, may be the result of a disorderly transaction and may be the result of consensus pricing. The Members assess the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 
 Some of our investments can also be valued using a market comparable or an enterprise market value technique. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the board of directors may consider in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or 
 16 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 subsequent equity sale occurs, the pricing indicated by the external event, excluding transaction costs, is used to corroborate the valuation. When using earnings multiples to value a portfolio company, the multiple used requires the use of judgment and estimates in determining how a market participant would price such an asset. These non-public investments using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Generally, the sensitivity of unobservable inputs or combination of inputs such as industry comparable companies, market outlook, consistency, discount rates and reliability of earnings and prospects for growth, or lack thereof, affects the multiple used in pricing an investment. As a result, any change in any one of those factors may have a significant impact on the valuation of an investment. Generally, an increase in a market yield will result in a decrease in the valuation of a debt investment, while a decrease in a market yield will have the opposite effect. Generally, an increase in an EBITDA multiple will result in an increase in the valuation of an investment, while a decrease in an EBITDA will have the opposite effect.

 5. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
 
 Cash equivalents represent cash invested in overnight money market funds. These temporary investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are deemed cash equivalents. Cash deposited at financial institutions is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ), up to specified limits. At times, such balances may exceed FDIC insured amounts. As of September 30, 2024, the entire amount of 68.4 million included in the cash and cash equivalents balance on the Consolidated Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Equity is comprised of money market funds, which are not subject to FDIC insurance. As of September 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents consisted of money market funds in the amounts of 77.4 million at fair value. PSSL believes it is not exposed to any significant risk of loss on its cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 6. MEMBERS EQUITY 
 
 PFLT and Kemper provide capital to PSSL in the form of equity interests. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, PFLT and Kemper owned 87.5 and 12.5 , respectively, of equity interests in PSSL. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, PFLT had commitments to fund equity interests to PSSL of 101.9 million and 101.9 million, respectively, of which none and 11.8 million, respectively, were unfunded. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, Kemper had commitments to fund equity interests to PSSL of 14.6 million and 14.6 million, respectively, of which none and 1.7 million, respectively, were unfunded. 

7. NOTES PAYABLE TO MEMBERS

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, PFLT had commitments to fund Member Notes to PSSL of 237.7 million and 237.7 million, respectively, of which none and 27.6 million, respectively, were unfunded.

 8. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
 
 Investment risk 
 
 PSSL seeks investment opportunities that offer the possibility of attaining income generation, capital preservation and capital appreciation including investments in private companies. Certain events particular to each industry in which PSSL s investments conduct their operations, as well as general economic and political conditions, may have a significant negative impact on the investee s operations and profitability. Such events are beyond PSSL s controls, and the likelihood that they may occur cannot be predicted. Furthermore, investments of PSSL are made in private companies and there are generally no public markets for these securities at the current time. The ability of PSSL to liquidate these investments and realize value is subject to significant limitations and uncertainties. 
 
 Leverage Risk 
 
 PSSL may borrow funds in order to increase the amount of capital available for investment. The use of leverage can improve the return on invested equity, however, such use may also magnify the potential for loss on invested equity capital. If the value of PSSL s assets decreases, leveraging would cause Members equity to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had PSSL not used leverage. Similarly, any decrease in PSSL s income would cause Members equity to decline more sharply than it would have had PSSL not borrowed. Borrowings will usually be from credit facilities and/or debt securitization which will typically be secured by PSSL s securities and other assets. Under certain circumstances, such debt may demand an increase in the collateral that secures PSSL s obligations and if PSSL was unable to provide additional collateral, the debt could liquidate assets held in the account to satisfy PSSL s obligations. Liquidation in this manner could have adverse consequences. Additionally, the amount of PSSL s borrowings and the interest rates on those borrowings, which will fluctuate, could have a significant effect on PSSL s profitability. 

Credit Risk 
 
 PSSL primarily invests in first lien secured debt to middle-market companies. A majority of the investments held by PSSL are subject to restrictions on their resale or are otherwise illiquid. PSSL assumes the credit risk of the borrower. In the event that the borrower becomes insolvent or enters bankruptcy, PSSL may incur certain costs and delays in realizing payment, or may suffer a loss of principal and/or interest. 
 
 9. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 
 The Members are responsible for all investment making and business decisions, therefore, there is no requirement to show financial highlights per ASC 946, which have been omitted accordingly. 

10. LEVERAGE 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 On January 26, 2021, PSSL II entered into a 125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with Ally Bank (the Ally Credit Facility ). Between June 3, 2021 and May 2, 2022, the Ally Credit Facility was amended to increase the total commitment to 325 million. On August 16, 2023, the total commitment was decreased to 260 million. Interest on the Ally Credit Facility changed from LIBOR plus 2.5 to SOFR plus 2.6 . On January 26, 2024, the maturity was extended and the Interest changed to SOFR plus 2.8 . The Ally credit facility matures on January 26, 2029 and is secured by substantially all of the assets held by PSSL II. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were 146.1 million and 48.6 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the Ally Credit Facility and we were in compliance with all required covenants in the facility. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, 
 19 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 there were 113.9 million and 211.4 million, respectively, in unfunded commitments under the Ally Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average interest rate was 7.6 and 7.8 , respectively. 
 
 Asset - Backed Debt 
 In January 2021, CLO II completed a 300.7 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation (the 2032 Asset-Backed Debt ). In May 2024, the 2032 Asset-Backed Debt was refinanced by a 300.7 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation, (the 2024 Debt Securitization or the 2036 Asset-Backed Debt ). The 2036 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio, CLO II, consisting primarily of middle market loans and participation interests in middle market loans. The 2036 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature in April 2036. The 2024 Debt Securitization was executed through a private placement of: (i) 174.0 million Class A-1R Senior Secured Floating Rate Loans and Notes maturing 2036, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 1.93 , (ii) 5.0 million Class A-2R Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2036, which bear interest at three month SOFR plus 2.20 , (iii) 25.0 million Class B-R Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2036, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 2.35 , (iv) 24.0 million Class C-R Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2036, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 3.10 , (v) 18.0 million Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2036, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 4.95 , and (vi) 18.0 million Class E Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2036, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 7.5 , under a credit agreement by and among the Securitization Issuers, as borrowers, various financial institutions, as lenders, and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent and as loan agent. 
 
 On the closing date of the 2024 Debt Securitization, PSSL retained 100 of the Preferred Shares of CLO II, 100 of the Class E Notes issued by CLO II, and a portion of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the 2036 Asset-Backed Debt. The Preferred Shares do not bear interest and had a stated value of approximately 36.7 million at the closing of the 2024 Debt Securitization. As part of the 2024 Debt Securitization, there was debt modification resulting in debt issuance costs of 1.0 million included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There was also debt extinguishment resulting in realized loss on debt extinguishment in the amount of 0.7 million included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining fees continue to be amortized and are included in amortization of deferred financing costs in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was 246.0 million and 246.0 million (2032 Asset-Backed Debt), respectively, of 2036 Asset-Backed Debt and there was 1.6 million and 2.0 million (2032 Asset-Backed Debt) of un-amortized financing costs, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average interest rate was 7.6 and 8.0 (2032 Asset-Backed Debt), respectively. 
 
 The 2036 Asset-Backed Debt is included in the Consolidated Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Equity as debt of the Company and the Class E Notes and the Preferred Shares have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 In April 2023, CLO VI completed a 297.8 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation (the 2023 Debt Securitization or the 2035 Asset-Backed Debt ). The 2035 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of middle market loans. The 2023 Debt Securitization was executed through a private placement of: (i) 171.0 million Class A-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Loans maturing 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 2.68 , (ii) 28.0 million Class B-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 3.75 , (iii) 5.0 million Class B-2 Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest of 7.634 , (v) 24.0 million Class C Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 5.25 , and (vi) 18.0 million Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 7.0 , under a credit agreement by and among the Securitization Issuers, as borrowers, various financial institutions, as lenders, and Wilmington Trust, as collateral agent and as loan agent. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was 246.0 million and 246.0 million, of 2035 Asset-Backed Debt and there was 2.1 million and 2.5 million, respectively, of un-amortized financing costs. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average interest rate was 8.6 and 8.5 , respectively. 
 
 On the closing date of the 2023 Debt Securitization, in consideration of our transfer to CLO VI of the initial closing date loan portfolio, PSSL received 100 of the Preferred Shares of CLO VI from the sale of the 2035 Asset-Backed Debt. The Preferred Shares do not bear interest and had a stated value of approximately 51.8 million at the closing of the 2023 Debt Securitization. 
 
 The 2035 Asset-Backed Debt is included in the Consolidated Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Equity as debt of the Company and the Preferred Shares have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 PennantPark Investment Adviser, LLC serves as collateral manager of the 2023 Debt Securitization and the 2024 Debt Securitization pursuant to a Collateral Management Agreement. For so long as PennantPark Investment Advisor, LLC serves as

Independent Auditor s Report 

Board of Directors 
 PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC 

Opinion 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC and its subsidiaries (the Fund), which comprise the consolidated statements of assets, liabilities and members equity, including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in members equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). 
 
 In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations, changes in members equity and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
 
 Emphasis of Matter 
 As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the 2022 financial statements have been restated to reclassify certain amounts presented within. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 
 
 Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 
 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
 In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. 

1 

Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 
 
 In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 
 
 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

The 2032 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature in January 2032. 
 
 In April 2023, PSSL completed a 297.8 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation, or the 2035 Asset-Backed Debt .

 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 PSSL is considered an investment company under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting guidance applicable to investment companies in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946. References to the Accounting Standards Codification, as amended ASC ), serves as a source of accounting literature. Subsequent events are evaluated and recognized or disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. In the opinion of the Company, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements have been included. Actual results could differ from these estimates due to changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates and assumptions. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions.

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

 (a) Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statement 
 
 During the preparation of the financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, Management identified 
 an error in the classification and presentation of cash pertaining to the Company s affiliate, PFLT, in the September 30, 2022 financial statements. The Company recorded cash activity and due from affiliate pertaining to their investments as an increase in the cash account instead of presenting the related cash and cash equivalents as an asset and another asset for due from affiliate. The impact of the error correction is reflected in a 3.6 million decrease to cash and offsetting increase to due from affiliates as of September 30, 2022 and a decrease in due from affiliates within operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows totaling 3.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. There was no impact from the error correction to total members' equity as reported on the consolidated statement of assets, liabilities and members' equity as of September 30, 2022. In addition, there was no impact from the error correction on net investment income or net increase (decrease) in members' equity resulting from operations in total as reported on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2022. The corrections were reported in the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our significant accounting policies consistently applied are as follows: 
 
 (b) Investment Valuations 
 
 We expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of our investments, which are or will be in our portfolio, and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy, described herein, and a consistently applied valuation process. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the board of directors may consider in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event in determining our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and the difference may be material. See Note 4. 
 
 Our portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 	 
 (1) Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC, the investment adviser to PFLT, responsible for the portfolio investment; 

(2) Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC; 

(3) Our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. The independent valuation firms review PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC s preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service, broker, dealer or market maker; 

(4) Our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis, periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms, and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and 

(5) Our board of directors assesses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC and the respective independent valuation firms. 

Our board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available. We obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at bid prices obtained from at least two brokers 
 12 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

 or dealers, if available, or otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 
 (c) Security Transactions, Revenue Recognition, and Realized/Unrealized Gains or Losses 
 
 Security transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt investments with contractual payment-in-kind, or PIK interest, which represents interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will generally not accrue PIK interest when the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectable. We do not accrue as a receivable, interest on loans and debt investments if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount OID ), market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and then accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned. 
 
 Loans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more and/or if there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest receivable is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the Company judgment. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in the Company judgment, are likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2023, we had two portfolio companies on non-accrual, representing 1.5 and 0.3 of our overall portfolio on a cost and fair value basis. As of September 30, 2022, none of our portfolio companies were on non-accrual. 
 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 

(d) Income Taxes 
 
 PSSL is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Accordingly, no provisions for U.S. income taxes have been made. The Members are responsible for reporting their share of the PSSL s income or loss on their U.S. income tax returns. 
 
 In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, the Company is required to determine whether a tax position of PSSL is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in PSSL recording a tax liability that would reduce members capital. 
 
 As of and for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022,management has determined that there were no material uncertain income tax positions. 
 
 (e) Foreign Currency Translation 
 
 Our books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis: 
 
 1. Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable period; and 

13 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

2. Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. 

Although Members capital and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, we do not isolate that portion of the results of operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates on investments, other assets and debt from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments. 
 
 Foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and U.S. government securities. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices to be more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities. 

(f) Consolidation 
 
 As explained by ASC paragraph 946-810-45, PSSL will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to us. 

(g) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes in 
 the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement , which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820. The ASU removed the requirements to disclosure the policy for the timing of transfers between levels, the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements, the Level 3 reconciliation from opening balances to closing balances, and the change in unrealized gains and losses of Level 3 fair value measurements held on the balance sheet date. While most changes are applied on a retrospective basis, the ASU still requires the change in unrealized gain and losses of Level 3 fair value measurements held as of the prior year to be disclosed. As a result of these removals certain modifications were made, including disclosure of the amount of and reason for transfers into and out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the amount of purchases and issues of Level 3 assets and liabilities. PSSL adopted this ASU for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting or ASU 2020-04. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company utilized the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the effect of which was not material to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
 
 In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) or ASU 2022-02, which is intended to address issues identified during the post-implementation review of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The amendment, among other things, eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors , while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted ASU 2022-02 on its consolidated financial statement and disclosures. 
 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, or ASU 2022-03, which changed the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. The amendments clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the 
 14 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

 adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the impact of the adoption is not expected to be material. 

3. AGREEMENTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 
 On June 10, 2022, PFLT was issued a capital call from the Company totaling 28.4 million consisting of Member notes of 19.9 million and equity interest of 8.5 million. PFLT fulfilled the June 10, 2022 capital call by contributing 28.0 million of securities and 0.4 million in cash to the Company. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, PSSL purchased 158.2 million and 275.8 million, in investments from PFLT, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, PSSL had a receivable from PFLT of 0.4 million and 3.6 million, respectively, 
 presented as a Due from Affiliate on the consolidated statements of assets, liabilities and members' equity. These amounts are related to cash owed to PSSL from PFLT in connection with trades between funds. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, PSSL incurred 2.1 and 1.8 million of Administration fees to the Administrative Agent, respectively. The Administrative Agent provides administration services to PSSL at an annual rate of 0.25 of average gross assets under management payable quarterly in arrears and calculated based on average gross assets measured at cost at the end of the two recently completed calendar quarters. 
 
 For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, PSSL incurred 30.3 million and 17.5 million of interest expense related to the notes outstanding with the Members, respectively. 

4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
 Fair value, as defined under ASC 820, is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date. 
 
 ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies: 
 
 Level 1:	Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. 
 
 Level 2:	Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term, if applicable, of the financial instrument. 
 
 Level 3:	Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. 
 
 A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments are classified as Level 3. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material. 
 15 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

The inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data is available, such information may be the result of consensus pricing information, disorderly transactions or broker quotes which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification as Level 3 information, assuming no additional corroborating evidence were available. Corroborating evidence that would result in classifying these non-binding broker/dealer bids as a Level 2 asset includes observable market-based transactions for the same or similar assets or other relevant observable market-based inputs that may be used in pricing an asset. 
 
 Our investments are generally structured as debt in the form of first lien secured debt, but may also include second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments. The transaction price, excluding transaction costs, is typically the best estimate of fair value at inception. Ongoing reviews by the Members and independent valuation firms are based on an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties, expected cash flows and market-based information including comparable transactions, performance multiples and yields, among other factors. These non-public investments using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in our ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. 
 
 In addition to using the above inputs in valuing cash equivalents and investments, we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value. See Note 2. 
 
 As outlined in the table below, some of our Level 3 investments using a market comparable valuation technique are valued using the average of the bids from brokers or dealers. The bids include a disclaimer, may not have corroborating evidence, may be the result of a disorderly transaction and may be the result of consensus pricing. The Members assess the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 
 Some of our investments can also be valued using a market comparable or an enterprise market value technique. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the board of directors may consider in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the pricing indicated by the external event, excluding transaction costs, is used to corroborate the valuation. When using earnings multiples to value a portfolio company, the multiple used requires the use of judgment and estimates in determining how a market participant would price such an asset. These non-public investments using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Generally, the sensitivity of unobservable inputs or combination of inputs such as industry comparable companies, market outlook, consistency, discount rates and reliability of earnings and prospects for growth, or lack thereof, affects the multiple used in pricing an investment. As a result, any change in any one of those factors may have a significant impact on the valuation of an investment. Generally, an increase in a market yield will result in a decrease in the valuation of a debt investment, while a decrease in a market yield will have the opposite effect. Generally, an increase in an EBITDA multiple will result in an increase in the valuation of an investment, while a decrease in an EBITDA will have the opposite effect. 

Our Level 3 valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges were categorized as follows for ASC 820 purposes:

5. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
 
 Cash equivalents represent cash invested in overnight money market funds. These temporary investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are deemed cash equivalents. Cash deposited at financial institutions is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ), up to specified limits. At times, such balances may exceed FDIC insured amounts. As of September 30, 2023, the entire amount of 77.4 million included in the cash and cash equivalents balance on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities is comprised of money market funds, which are not subject to FDIC insurance. As of September 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents consisted of money market funds in the amounts of 30.2 million at fair value. PSSL believes it is not exposed to any significant risk of loss on its cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 6. MEMBERS EQUITY 
 
 PFLT and Kemper provide capital to PSSL in the form of equity interests. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, PFLT and Kemper owned 87.5 and 12.5 , respectively, of equity interests in PSSL. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, PFLT had commitments to fund equity interests to PSSL of 101.9 million and 90.0 million, respectively, of which 11.8 million and 8.5 million, respectively, were unfunded. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, Kemper had commitments to fund equity interests to PSSL of 14.6 million and 12.9 million, respectively, of which 1.7 million and 1.2 million, respectively were unfunded. 

7. NOTES PAYABLE TO MEMBERS 
 
 PFLT and Kemper provide capital to PSSL in the form of first lien secured debt Member Notes ). The Member Notes were previously subordinated debt that were modified during the year ended September 30, 2018 to eliminate the subordination provision. The Member Notes bear an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 8.0 through June 30, 2023 and 3-month SOFR plus 8.0 after June 30, 2023 and mature on May 6, 2024. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, PFLT and Kemper owned 87.5 and 12.5 of the Member Notes, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, PFLT had commitments to fund Member Notes to PSSL of 237.7 million and 210.1 million, respectively, of which 27.6 million and 19.9 million, respectively, were unfunded. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, Kemper had commitments to fund Member Notes to PSSL of 34.0 million and 30.0 million, respectively, of which 3.9 million and 2.8 million, respectively, were unfunded. 
 
 8. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
 
 Investment risk 
 
 PSSL seeks investment opportunities that offer the possibility of attaining income generation, capital preservation and capital appreciation including investments in private companies. Certain events particular to each industry in which PSSL s investments conduct their operations, as well as general economic and political conditions, may have a significant negative impact on the investee s operations and profitability. Such events are beyond PSSL s controls, and the likelihood that they may occur cannot be predicted. Furthermore, investments of PSSL are made in private companies and there are generally no public markets for these securities at the current time. The ability of PSSL to liquidate these investments and realize value is subject to significant limitations and uncertainties. 
 
 Leverage Risk 
 
 PSSL may borrow funds in order to increase the amount of capital available for investment. The use of leverage can improve the return on invested equity, however, such use may also magnify the potential for loss on invested equity capital. If the value of PSSL s assets decreases, leveraging would cause Members equity to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had PSSL not used leverage. Similarly, any decrease in PSSL s income would cause Members equity to decline more sharply than it would have had PSSL not borrowed. Borrowings will usually be from credit facilities and/or debt securitization which will typically be 
 18 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

 secured by PSSL s securities and other assets. Under certain circumstances, such debt may demand an increase in the collateral that secures PSSL s obligations and if PSSL was unable to provide additional collateral, the debt could liquidate assets held in the account to satisfy PSSL s obligations. Liquidation in this manner could have adverse consequences. Additionally, the amount of PSSL s borrowings and the interest rates on those borrowings, which will fluctuate, could have a significant effect on PSSL s profitability. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 PSSL primarily invests in first lien secured debt to middle-market companies. A majority of the investments held by PSSL are subject to restrictions on their resale or are otherwise illiquid. PSSL assumes the credit risk of the borrower. In the event that the borrower becomes insolvent or enters bankruptcy, PSSL may incur certain costs and delays in realizing payment, or may suffer a loss of principal and/or interest. 
 
 9. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 
 The Members are responsible for all investment making and business decisions, therefore, there is no requirement to show financial highlights per ASC 946, which have been omitted accordingly. 

10. LEVERAGE 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 On January 26, 2021, PSSL II entered into a 125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with Ally Bank (the Ally Credit Facility ). Between June 3, 2021 and May 2, 2022, the Ally Credit Facility was amended to increase the total commitment to 325 million. On August 16, 2023, the total commitment was decreased to 260 million. Interest on the Ally Credit Facility ranged from LIBOR plus 2.5 to SOFR plus 2.6 . The Ally credit facility matures on January 26, 2026 and is secured by substantially all of the assets held by PSSL II. As of September 30, 2023 there were 48.6 million in outstanding borrowings under the Ally Credit Facility and we were in compliance with all required covenants in the facility. 
 
 Asset - Backed Debt 
 In January 2021, CLO II completed a 300.7 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation (the Debt Securitization or the 2032 Asset-Backed Debt ). The 2032 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of middle market loans. The Debt Securitization was executed through a private placement of: (i) 171.0 million Class A-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Loans maturing 2032, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 1.9 , (ii) 6.0 million Class A-2 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2032, which bear interest at three month SOFR plus 2.25 , (iii) 15.5 million Class B-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2032, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 2.6 , (iv) 8.5 million Class B-2 Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2032, which bear interest of 3.14 , (v) 27.0 million Class C Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2032, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 4.25 , (vi) 18.0 million Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2032, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 6.5 , and (vii) 18.0 million Class E Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2032, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 8.5 , under a credit agreement by and among the Securitization Issuers, as borrowers, various financial institutions, as lenders, and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent and as loan agent. As of September 30, 2023 there was 246.0 million of 2032 Asset-Backed Debt and there was 2.0 million of un-amortized financing costs. As of September 30, 2023 the weighted average interest rate was 8.0 . 
 
 On the closing date of the Debt Securitization, in consideration of our transfer to CLO II of the initial closing date loan portfolio, PSSL received 100 of the Preferred Shares of CLO II, 100 of the Class E Notes issued by CLO II, and a portion of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the 2032 Asset-Backed Debt. The Preferred Shares do not bear interest and had a stated value of approximately 36.7 million at the closing of the Debt Securitization. 
 
 The 2032 Asset-Backed Debt is included in the Consolidated Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Equity as debt of the Company and the Class E Notes and the Preferred Shares have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 In April 2023, CLO VI completed a 297.8 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation (the Debt Securitization or the 2035 Asset-Backed Debt ). The 2035 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of middle market loans. The Debt Securitization was executed through a private placement of: (i) 171.0 million Class A-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Loans maturing 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 2.68 , (ii) 28.0 million 
 19 

PENNANTPARK SENIOR SECURED LOAN FUND I LLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

 Class B-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 3.75 , (iii) 5.0 million Class B-2 Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest of 7.634 , (v) 24.0 million Class C Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 5.25 , and (vi) 18.0 million Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2035, which bear interest at the three-month SOFR plus 7.0 , under a credit agreement by and among the Securitization Issuers, as borrowers, various financial institutions, as lenders, and Wilmington Trust, as collateral agent and as loan agent. As of September 30, 2023 there was 246.0 million of 2035 Asset-Backed Debt and there was 2.5 million of un-amortized financing costs. As of September 30, 2023 the weighted average interest rate was 8.5 . 
 
 On the closing date of the Debt Securitization, in consideration of our transfer to CLO VI of the initial closing date loan portfolio, PSSL received 100 of the Preferred Shares of CLO VI from the sale of the 2035 Asset-Backed Debt. The Preferred Shares do not bear interest and had a stated value of approximately 51.8 million at the closing of the Debt Securitization. 
 
 The 2035 Asset-Backed Debt is included in the Consolidated Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Equity as debt of the Company and the Preferred Shares have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 PennantPark Investment Adviser, LLC serves as collateral manager to the Securitization Issuers pursuant to a Collateral Management Agreement. For so long as PennantPark Investment Advisor, LLC serves as collateral manager, it will elect to irrevocably waive any collateral management fee to which it may be entitled under the Collateral Management Agreements. 

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCY 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company had 1.1 million and 2.5 million, respectively, of unfunded commitments to fund existing investments. 
 
 The Company has provided general indemnifications to the Members, affiliates of the Members, and any person acting on behalf of the Members or that affiliate when they act, in good faith, in the best interest of the Company. The Company is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim but expects the risk of having to make any payments under these general business indemnifications to be remote. 
 
 12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
 
 Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued, December 7, 2023. There were no events that required disclosure.
