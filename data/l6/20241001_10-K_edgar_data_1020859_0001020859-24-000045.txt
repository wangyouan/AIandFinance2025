 PART I. 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K Annual Report or Report ), unless otherwise specified, references to United Natural Foods , UNFI , we , us , our or the Company mean United Natural Foods, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a Delaware corporation based in Providence, Rhode Island. We conduct our business through various subsidiaries. Since the formation of our predecessor in 1976, we have grown our business both organically and through acquisitions, which have expanded our distribution network, product selection and customer base. 
 
 Our Background 
 
 UNFI is a leading distributor of grocery and non-food products, and support services provider to retailers in the United States and Canada. We believe we are uniquely positioned to provide the broadest array of products and services to customers throughout North America. Our diversified customer base includes over 30,000 customer locations ranging from some of the largest grocers in the country to smaller independents as well. We offer approximately 250,000 products consisting of national, regional and private label brands grouped into the following main product categories: grocery and general merchandise; perishables; frozen foods; wellness and personal care items; and bulk and foodservice products. We believe we are North America s premier grocery wholesaler with 55 distribution centers and warehouses representing approximately 31 million square feet of warehouse space. We are a coast-to-coast distributor with customers in all 50 states as well as all ten provinces in Canada, making us a desirable partner for retailers and consumer product manufacturers. We believe our total product assortment and service offerings are unmatched by our wholesale competitors. We plan to continue to pursue new business opportunities with independent retailers that operate diverse formats, regional and national chains, as well as international customers with wide-ranging needs. Our business is classified into two reportable segments: Wholesale and Retail; and also includes a manufacturing division and a branded product line division. 
 
 Our Strategic Priorities 
 
 We are continually striving to better serve our stakeholders, including our customers, suppliers, associates and communities, and to drive profitable growth and sustainable shareholder value creation. We have undertaken a new strategy and have established new three-year financial objectives that begin in fiscal 2025 and are designed to make the Company more efficient while improving free cash flow generation and reducing net leverage. 
 
 Our strategy is centered on adding value to our customers and suppliers through our expansive assortment of products, services, programs, and insights that help them grow and compete. Our strategy is highly focused on actively positioning our Company to add value to a resilient portion of the food retail industry that totals over 90 billion of wholesale sales and includes many specialty, natural, multi-cultural and conventional retailers. This new strategy capitalizes on UNFI s strengths, including our heritage in natural and organic products, as well as our growing, value-added digital and professional services portfolio. Simultaneously, we are working to improve free cash flow generation and reduce net leverage by optimizing controllable variables including: 
 
 1. Intensified Network Optimization : Streamlining our distribution center footprint to create a more efficient supply chain with a lower level of fixed capital invested. 
 2. Reduced Capital Intensity : Prioritizing capital investment needs and reducing the overall level of future spending while continuing to emphasize maintenance and targeted network enablement and technology enhancements. We also plan to lower overall working capital levels while driving higher customer satisfaction. 
 3. Optimized Cost Structure : Reducing ongoing operating expenses and better aligning corporate resources to reflect our updated strategy and customer and supplier-facing work. 
 
 During fiscal 2024, we continued to implement near-term initiatives to help improve profitability and strengthen our foundation while we finalized and began implementing our revised strategy. 
 
 We expect to continue to use available capital to re-invest in our business and are committed to improving our free cash flow and financial leverage while reducing outstanding debt. 
 
 We believe we can optimize our performance and profitability through our improvement efforts, which we expect will improve our cost structure, increase sales of products and services, and position us to provide tailored, data-driven solutions to help our customers run their businesses more efficiently and contribute to customer acquisitions.

 Our Commitment to Social and Environmental Responsibility 
 
 Creating a Better Future for Communities 
 
 As North America s premier grocery wholesaler, we are working to create a better future for our communities by improving access to quality food, empowering our associates to give back and protecting the planet we share. We look for ways to use our scale to drive progress across the food industry, while focusing on sustainability initiatives that drive efficiency and cost savings and create sustainable value for our stakeholders. Now in the fourth year since unveiling our Better for All impact strategy, we continue to evaluate the impacts we have along our value chain, focusing on proactively engaging with the people making and moving the products we distribute. 
 
 In fiscal 2024, we published our 13th annual Better for All report, which offers a summary of our social, environmental, and governance impacts during the fiscal year. The report demonstrates our enhanced focus on our six most pressing impact areas: safety, well-being, waste, climate, sourcing and community. The report is available on our website at www.betterforall.unfi.com and highlights progress toward our goals, including waste reduction, supplier diversity, food donations and food safety. Our Better for All report and the contents of our Better for All webpage are not incorporated by reference into or considered to be part of this Annual Report. 
 
 Upstream 
 
 Our impact begins with the decisions made by our partners and suppliers, well before products reach our distribution centers. We are investing in programs and partnerships that are designed to help build a more equitable system and carry our values further upstream. In fiscal 2023, we launched the UNFI Climate Action Partnership, encouraging suppliers to set credible climate goals. The program builds on UNFI s Climate Action Hub, which offers suppliers a variety of tools and resources to innovate and scale climate solutions across the food system. We also published a new Deforestation Policy, an updated Animal Welfare Position Statement, and an updated Supplier and Vendor Code of Conduct, clearly outlining expectations of suppliers on responsible procurement topics. These policies help us to work more efficiently and effectively with suppliers and vendors in pursuing our shared goals. 
 
 Operations 
 
 We remain focused on operating efficiently and sustainably, which includes managing the social and environmental impacts within our direct control. Our associates safety and well-being are of utmost importance to us. Our primary goal is to cultivate a culture that values care and safety for all. Through continuous efforts we are dedicated to minimizing the risk of injuries and accidents, ensuring a safe and thriving environment for everyone. In fiscal 2024, for the third year in a row, we received a score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index. In fiscal 2024, our seven associate-led Belonging Innovation Groups continued to cultivate a culture of innovation, learning and impact across the Company. 
 
 In addition, we began work on a new roof-mounted solar array installation at our Riverside, California distribution center, which will be our largest to date. UNFI s solar array initiatives provide a strong return on investment and reduce the energy cost of operating a distribution center, while lowering the Company s carbon footprint. 
 
 Downstream 
 
 We aim to be responsible community members, from how we provide information and services to our customers, to the local organizations our associates support with their volunteer hours. In fiscal 2024, we significantly grew associate volunteerism, and the UNFI Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization, began implementation of its five-year plan and awarded over 1.5 million in grants. We also made significant strides toward our food waste reduction goal and deployed a Reverse Logistics Disposition Reporting system at all UNFI distribution centers to enhance inventory visibility and operational efficiency. This initiative is expected to reduce food waste, minimize waste disposal costs and decrease shrink in the distribution centers. 
 
 Social and environmental responsibility remains integral to our overall business strategy, and we believe these practices deliver significant value to our stakeholders, including our stockholders, associates, customers, suppliers and communities.

 Our Customers 
 
 We maintain long-standing relationships with many of our customers. We serve over 30,000 unique customer locations, primarily located across the United States and Canada, which we classify into five customer types: Chains; Independent retailers; Supernatural; Retail; and Other. Refer to Note 3 Revenue Recognition in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 
 One Wholesale customer, which includes customers under common control, constituted more than 10 of total Net sales in fiscal 2024. On May 21, 2024, we amended and restated our distribution agreement with our largest customer which, among other things, extended the term of that agreement through May 20, 2032. 
 
 Our international Net sales primarily reflect UNFI Canada, Inc. UNFI Canada ), which represented approximately 1 of our Net sales in fiscal 2024. International business excludes sales transacted in U.S. dollars and shipped internationally, which is an even smaller component of our business. 
 
 We also continue to invest in technology and systems with the intent of improving the efficiency of our operations, enhancing the customer experience and growing our services platform, including our eCommerce and innovation businesses. This includes sales to eCommerce companies as well as business-to-business sales to non-traditional customers. Marketplace by UNFI is our business-to-business digital eCommerce solution for emerging brands looking to expand distribution with UNFI customers. Through this virtual marketplace, suppliers gain immediate access to UNFI s digital infrastructure to promote and sell their products to UNFI s broad customer base while UNFI customers gain access to an even broader assortment of unique and local items with flexible order sizes and the convenience of ordering from multiple sources online in one place. 
 
 Wholesale 
 
 We organize and operate our Wholesale reportable segment through three U.S. geographic regions: East, Central and West, each of which is led by a separate regional president responsible for product and service strategy, execution, and financial results; and Canada Wholesale, which is operated separately from the U.S. Wholesale business. Product and service categories include grocery, fresh, private brands, wellness and personal care items, eCommerce and foodservice. This operating structure includes regional sales organizations and distribution center networks, which offer a combination of conventional and natural products to our customers as a consolidated supply solution. Territory managers in these regions sell our complete lines of products, which allows us to anticipate and identify sales opportunities that result from our customers having a single point of contact for all of our products and services. 
 
 Operations 
 
 We have established a national network of strategically located distribution centers utilizing a multi-tiered logistics system. The network includes facilities that carry slow turn or fast turn groceries, perishables, general merchandise and home, health and beauty care products. For financial reporting purposes, sales from our distribution centers to our own Retail stores are eliminated from of our Wholesale segment within Eliminations. 
 
 We offer Wholesale customers a wide variety of food and non-food products, and our own lines of private label products. We also offer a broad array of professional services. As a logistics provider, efficiency is an important customer service measure. We are in the process of optimizing our facilities to implement leading warehouse technology, ranging from radio-frequency devices guiding selectors to mechanized facilities with completely automated order selection for dry groceries that help us deliver aisle-ready pallets to Wholesale customers. Deployment of continuous improvement methodologies within our supply chain is focused on delivering labor and cost efficiencies while also improving our ability to more effectively service our customers. 
 
 To maintain our market position and improve our operating efficiencies, we seek to continually: 
 expand our marketing and customer service programs across regions; 
 expand our national purchasing opportunities; 
 offer a broader product and value add service selection than our competitors; 
 offer operational excellence with high service levels and a higher percentage of on-time deliveries and fill rates than our competitors; 
 centralize and streamline general and administrative functions to reduce expenses; 
 consolidate systems applications among physical locations and regions; and 
 invest in our people, facilities, equipment and technology.

 Procurement 
 
 We maintain contracts with suppliers to procure their products. Our procurement process includes assessments of demand planning, pricing, seasonality and other factors. Inventory costs are determined when products are procured and include vendor funds received and inbound freight, among other items. The gross margins we earn on sales to our customers are typically based on a percentage mark-up, or fee, on top of vendor listed base cost, which vary by customer, product type, vendor size, volume throughput, transportation methods and distances, among other factors. Net sales to customers are determined at the time of sale based on the then prevailing vendor listed base cost, and include discounts we offer to our customers. The differential between the procured cost, including vendor funds and inbound freight, as compared to the net sales price of these products, primarily generates our gross margin. 
 
 Retail 
 
 Our Retail segment includes 76 Cub Foods and Shoppers retail grocery stores. Our retail stores provide an extensive grocery offering and, depending on size, a variety of additional products, including general merchandise, home, health and beauty care, and pharmacy. We offer national and local brands, as well as our own private label products. A typical retail store carries approximately 17,000 to 21,000 core SKUs and ranges in size from approximately 50,000 to 70,000 square feet. We believe our retail banners have strong local and regional brand recognition in the markets in which they operate. Our Retail operations are principally supplied by six of our Wholesale distribution centers. 
 
 Our Product Offerings 
 
 Our extensive selection of products includes natural, organic, specialty, produce and conventional grocery, and non-food products. We offer nationally recognized brand name and private label products, including grocery (both perishable and nonperishable), general merchandise, home, health and beauty care, and pharmacy, which are sold through our Wholesale segment to wholesale customers and our Retail stores. We offer the following main product categories: grocery and general merchandise; perishables; frozen foods; wellness and personal care items; and bulk and foodservice products. 
 
 Our owned brands portfolio is a collection of brands that offer high quality solutions for private label to our customers. ESSENTIAL EVERYDAY is our leading national brand equivalent private label solution with nearly 2,200 items for departments throughout the store. It is complemented by SHOPPERS VALUE , which offers the budget conscious consumer quality alternatives to national brands. Our WILD HARVEST brand offers a full range of products made with simple, wholesome ingredients across multiple categories, including pet foods. Our Field Day brand is primarily sold to natural store / co-op retailers as a private label solution. Our category-specific brands, primarily including STONE RIDGE CREAMERY , EQUALINE , and CULINARY CIRCLE , also provide national brand equivalent products at a competitive price. 
 
 Our Blue Marble Brands portfolio is a collection of national brands that offer United States Department of Agriculture USDA organic, non-GMO Project Verified, and specialty food and non-food items. The WOODSTOCK brand has been pioneering organic / non-GMO products for over 35 years and continues to launch innovative products. 
 
 Our subsidiary doing business as Woodstock Farms Manufacturing specializes in importing, roasting, packaging and distributing nuts, dried fruit, seeds, trail mixes, granola, natural and organic snack items and confections for our customers and in the Company s branded products. We operate an organic (USDA and Quality Assurance International QAI )) and kosher (Circle K) certified packaging, roasting, and processing facility in New Jersey that is SQF (Safety Quality Food) level 2 certified. Woodstock Farms Manufacturing sells items manufactured in bulk and through private label packaging arrangements with large health food, supermarket and convenience store chains and independent retailers. 
 
 Our Service Offerings 
 
 We offer a broad array of professional services that provide Wholesale customers with cost-effective and scalable business solutions. Our services are designed to help customers address business challenges, better serve their customers and compete in the marketplace. These services include solutions we develop and provide directly, as well as pass-through programs in which vendors provide services directly to our Wholesale customers. We provide shelf and planogram management, retail store support, pricing strategy, electronic payments processing, advertising, couponing, store layout and design, equipment sourcing and procurement, point-of-sale hardware and software, network and data hosting solutions, consumer convenience services, eCommerce, automation tools, sustainability services and administrative back-office solutions.

Table of Contents 

 We offer a variety of marketing services designed to increase sales for our customers and suppliers, including consumer and trade marketing programs, as well as programs to support suppliers in understanding our markets. Trade and consumer marketing programs are supplier-sponsored programs that cater to a broad range of retail formats. Retail marketing programs offer web and digital marketing services, including websites, mobile applications and eCommerce capabilities, and circular programs for our customers and vendors. Supplier marketing programs include information sharing programs designed to provide heightened transparency to suppliers through demand planning, forecasting and procurement insights. We have also created a retail media network, the UNFI Media Network UMN ), that enables retailers to reach their consumers digitally while connecting to our large network of suppliers, who in turn, can utilize the platform for personalized and targeted digital marketing. All of our programs and services are designed to educate consumers, profile suppliers and increase sales for retailers, many of which do not have the resources necessary to conduct such marketing programs independently. Our goal is to provide support to ensure collective long-term success. 
 
 In addition to these services, we provide data, insights and resources that help our customers compete and succeed in their respective markets. We also offer our customers: 
 trends reports in the natural and organic industry: 
 product data information such as best seller lists, store usage reports and catalogs; 
 in-store signage and promotional materials, and assistance with product display planning and set up; 
 shelf tags for products; and 
 a robust retailer portal with product information, search and ordering capabilities, reports and publications. 
 
 Our Suppliers 
 
 We purchase our products from nearly 11,000 suppliers. The majority of our suppliers are based in the United States and Canada, but we also source products from suppliers throughout the world. We believe suppliers seek to distribute their products through us because we provide access to a large customer base across the United States and Canada, distribute the majority of the suppliers products and offer a wide variety of marketing programs to our customers to help sell our suppliers products. Substantially all product categories that we distribute are available from a number of suppliers and, therefore, we are not dependent on any single supply source for any product category. In addition, although we have exclusive distribution arrangements and support programs with several suppliers, none of our suppliers accounted for more than 5 of our total purchases in fiscal 2024. 
 
 We have positioned ourselves as one of the largest purchasers of organically grown bulk products in the natural and organic products industry by centralizing our purchase of nuts, seeds, grains, flours and dried foods. As a result, we are able to negotiate purchases from suppliers on the basis of volume and other considerations that may include discounted pricing or prompt payment discounts. Furthermore, some of our purchase arrangements include the right of return to the supplier with respect to products that we do not sell in a specified period of time. Each region is responsible for placing its own orders and can select the products that it believes will most appeal to its customers, although each region is able to participate in our company-wide purchasing programs. 
 
 Our Distribution Network 
 
 Logistics 
 
 We select the sites for our distribution centers to provide direct access to the markets we serve and configure them to minimize total operating costs. This proximity allows us to reduce our transportation costs relative to those of our competitors that seek to service these customers from locations that are often further away. We believe that we incur lower inbound freight expense than our regional competitors because our scale allows us to buy full and partial truckloads of products. Products are delivered to our distribution centers primarily by our fleet of leased and owned trucks, contract carriers and the suppliers themselves. When financially advantageous, we pick up products from suppliers or satellite staging facilities and return them to our distribution centers using our own trucks. Additionally, the scale of our distribution network provides us with the flexibility to shift volume amongst distribution centers in the case of volume spikes, unique customer needs, temporary inbound fill rate challenges and weather-related events as well as the capacity to support future sales growth. 
 
 The majority of our trucks are leased and are maintained by third-party national leasing companies, which in some cases maintain facilities on our premises for the maintenance and service of these vehicles. We also have facilities where we operate our own maintenance shops.

Table of Contents 

 We ship certain orders for supplements or for items that are destined for areas outside of regular delivery routes through independent carriers. Deliveries to areas outside the continental United States and Canada are typically shipped by freight-forwarders through ocean-going containers. 
 
 Organic Certification 
 
 We have 33 distribution centers in the United States that are National Organic Program certified as Organic Handlers by QAI . Our California locations are certified as Organic Handlers by QAI, and we are registered as Organic Handlers with the State of California Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch and the California Department of Food and Agriculture. In addition, our Canadian distribution center in British Columbia holds an Organic Distributor certification from QAI. 
 
 We maintain a comprehensive quality assurance program. All products we sell that are represented as organic are required to be certified as such by an independent third-party agency. We maintain current certification affidavits on most organic commodities and produce in order to verify the authenticity of the product. Most potential suppliers of organic products are required to provide such third-party certifications to us before they are approved as suppliers. 
 
 Our Technology Investments 
 
 We continue to make significant investments in distribution, financial, information and warehouse management systems. We continually evaluate and upgrade our systems and distribution center infrastructure to enhance security, efficiency, cost-effectiveness and responsiveness to customer needs. We believe these systems include best in class functionality in warehouse management systems, inventory control, labor management, scan-based fulfillment applications, mechanized pick-to-light systems and order management systems. We are in the process of updating our fulfillment technology with Universal Product Code UPC scan-based technology for selection, loading and customer deliveries to ensure order accuracy throughout the supply chain. We have also begun to make significant investments in warehouse automation solutions to support full case and unit pick fulfillment processes. These investments are intended to unlock our supply chain capabilities, improve customer experience and enable growth. We continue to leverage a management information system that enables us to lower inbound transportation costs by making optimum use of our own fleet of trucks and/or by consolidating deliveries to achieve full truckloads. In addition, we use cloud solutions to assist us in developing the most efficient routes, tracking vehicle maintenance and monitoring driver safety and the movement of trucks in real-time. As part of our one company approach, we continue an effort to standardize to best in industry software solutions for inventory procurement, order management, transportation operations and warehouse management systems throughout our network. Our investment in technology is intended to improve our supply chain effectiveness for our suppliers, associates and customers enabling our collective success. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Our Wholesale and Retail businesses operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving industry, which is characterized by low profit margins, new business models and the entry of new, non-traditional competitors that intensify competition. Our food distribution business competes with many traditional and specialty grocery wholesalers and retailers that maintain or develop self-distribution systems for the business of independent grocery retailers. We also increasingly compete with retailers that maintain or develop self-distribution systems, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. The primary competitive factors in the Wholesale business include price, service level, product quality, variety, availability, location of distribution centers and other value-added services. In recent years, consolidation within the grocery industry has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased competition, including from some competitors that have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. 
 
 Independent retailers and smaller Chain customers represent a significant portion of our business and face intense competition from national grocery chains, supercenters, deep discounters, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores and eCommerce providers, many of whom offer expansive services beyond grocery. 
 
 Our retail banners compete with traditional and specialty grocery stores, supercenters, deep discounters, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores and eCommerce providers. The principal competitive factors in grocery retail include the location and image of the store; the price, quality, and variety of the fresh offering; and the quality, convenience, and consistency of service. Competitive strategies vary based on many factors, such as the competitor s format, strengths, weaknesses, pricing, and sales focus. Our retail stores have continued to respond to growing competition from online and non-traditional retailers by adding options and services such as online ordering, curbside pick-up and home delivery.

 Government Regulation 
 
 Our operations and many of the products that we distribute in the United States are subject to regulation by state and local health departments, the USDA and the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ), which generally impose standards for product quality and sanitation and are responsible for the administration of bioterrorism legislation. In the United States, our facilities generally are inspected at least once annually by state or federal authorities. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the USDA to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. 
 
 The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act in the United States and the Safe Foods for Canadians Act in Canada have expanded food safety requirements across the food supply chain and, among other things, impose additional regulations focused on prevention of food contamination, more frequent inspection of high-risk facilities, increased record-keeping, and improved tracing of food. Products that do not meet regulatory standards and/or comply with these regulations may be considered to be adulterated and/or misbranded and subject to recall. 
 
 The Surface Transportation Board and the Federal Highway Administration regulate our trucking operations. In addition, interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the United States Department of Transportation and other relevant federal and state agencies. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. 
 
 Our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor and similar regulations by state agencies. These regulations require us to comply with certain health and safety standards to protect our employees from recognized hazards. We are also subject to the National Labor Relations Act, which provides employees the right to organize and bargain collectively with their employer and to engage in other protected concerted activity, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, which establishes minimum wages and overtime standards, among other requirements. 
 
 Our facilities in the United States and in Canada are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Further, many of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel, hydrogen fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks. Moreover, in some of our facilities we, or third parties with whom we contract, perform vehicle maintenance. Our policy is to comply with all applicable federal, state, provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials. 
 
 Our international business operations are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the import and export of products and preventing corruption and bribery (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). We have implemented and continue to develop import/export and anti-corruption compliance programs and processes to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing our international business activities. 
 
 Human Capital Management 
 
 Our employees are critical to supporting our values and achieving our strategic vision, and we are striving to be an employer of choice. We are focused on associate engagement, empowerment and safety to foster innovation and bring best-in-class solutions to our customers and suppliers in an ever-changing retail landscape, including new ways of work scheduling and productivity investments. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight of human capital management matters with a focus on associate wellbeing across a variety of measures. 
 
 As of August 3, 2024, we had approximately 28,333 full and part-time employees, 10,704 of whom (approximately 38 are covered by 48 collective bargaining agreements, including existing agreements under negotiation. We have been the focus of union-organizing efforts, and we believe it is likely that similar efforts will continue in the future.

 Developing Talent 
 
 Attracting and retaining talent is one of our top priorities. Our goal is to differentiate ourselves in the market by offering flexibility to associates in the way, when and how they work. To reduce turnover, we have an emphasized focus on and commitment to our associates, their experiences as well as their continued engagement. We are committed to the continued support and development of our associates and provide access to robust leadership development programming, role-based training and other career development opportunities at every stage of an associate s tenure with us. Designed to enhance the leadership capabilities of our people, we design and deliver optional programs to leaders across all departments to come together to learn and practice their management skills as well as identify opportunities to lead more effectively. The Elevate program for Director-level and above associates works to solidify our talent pipeline and promote the success of the organization s future leaders. Our Learning Development teams partner with key groups such as Sales, Operations, Transportation and Environmental Health Safety to develop role-based training to drive greater productivity and safety. We also offer associates additional learning and career development opportunities that extend from skills-based training deployed electronically through our BetterU learning system, to mentorship programs and career development discussions and beyond. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 
 Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to promote a culture of wellbeing and recognize our associates for their outstanding achievements and dedication to serving our customers and keeping them safe during even the most challenging of times. We are committed to offering market competitive pay programs that reward high levels of performance and behaviors that challenge convention and drive company success. Our short-term incentive programs are tied to the Company s financial goals and are intended to align our eligible associates rewards with our financial success. Long-term incentives, including restricted stock units and performance stock unit awards, are designed to attract and retain innovative leaders and align their financial interests with that of our shareholders and other stakeholders. As part of our commitment to recognize our associates whole self health, finances and overall wellbeing we offer a comprehensive health and welfare benefit program to eligible associates providing a variety of medical, dental and vision options plus additional voluntary benefits like long-term disability and optional life insurance. Additionally, we provide to eligible associates a leading edge, no-cost wellness program, paid time off programs including paid parental leave, an employee assistance program, 401(k) plan and a recently enhanced education assistance program. 
 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
 In order to recruit, inspire and retain the most talented team at all levels that maximizes speed, agility, innovation, execution and performance from the Boardroom to our distribution centers, we pledge to promote equity, celebrate diversity and support inclusion for all. Our Board of Directors is diverse in gender and ethnic background, as well as having a broad range of experience, with four out of 11 directors identifying as female, two members identifying as African American, one member identifying as Asian American, one member identifying as LGBTQ+ and one member identifying as a veteran. We recognize that innovation thrives when there is unity and respect for diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Additionally, we aim to foster a culture of belonging, equity and empathy through open dialogues, educational opportunities and by honoring the experiences and special events that speak to our associates many identities. 
 
 We built a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion DEI team, and our DEI strategy is built on a foundation of research, best practices and leadership commitment. Our Vice President of Diversity, Inclusion, Equity and Wellbeing oversees our DEI efforts, inclusive procurement initiatives and wellbeing programs. Our diversity and wellbeing council and seven associate-led Belonging Innovation Groups actively strive to create a workplace where all associates feel welcome and are motivated to reach their full potential. We developed a multi-pronged approach to educate and engage associates that includes open discussions on various dimensions of diversity, a podcast, DEI and mental health awareness trainings on our associate platforms, targeted volunteerism, and campaigns encouraging respect and empathy. 
 
 Creating a Safe Environment 
 
 Safety is at the forefront of everything we do. We continue to focus on the safety of our associates, customers, communities and consumers with increased safety measures. We continue to be committed to continuous learning and improvement, and we believe in the power of learning from past experiences to enhance our safety system and performance, including through root cause incident analysis. We also continue to invest in our safety brand and pledge, Every Moment Matters, which is designed to foster a culture of caring and doing the right thing.

 This past year, we focused on reducing lost time injuries LTI ), improving our root cause analysis process, implementing a comprehensive safety management software solution, completing internal and external audits and closing findings identified therein, creating more comprehensive reporting on key performance indicators and continuing to build upon our safety culture. In fiscal 2024, we were able to reduce our LTI rate by nearly 50 . We also began installation of a new video telematics solution to optimize fleet operations and improve driver safety, while continuing to reduce our preventable accident rates. Additionally, we increased our focus on how we deliver value to our customers and consumers, strengthening our food safety programs with the creation of our vision for a world class food safety management system. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Overall product sales are fairly balanced throughout the year, although demand for certain products of a seasonal nature may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other annual events. Our working capital needs are generally greater during the months of and leading up to high sales periods, such as the buildup in inventory leading to the calendar year-end holidays. Our inventory, accounts payable and accounts receivable levels may be impacted by macroeconomic impacts and changes in food-at-home purchasing rates. These effects can result in normal operating fluctuations in working capital balances, which in turn can result in changes to cash flow from operations that are not necessarily indicative of long-term operating trends.

 Strategic and Operational Risks 
 
 A significant portion of our revenues are from our principal customers, and our success is heavily dependent on retaining this business and on our principal customers ability to maintain and grow their businesses. 
 
 A significant portion of our revenues is from our principal customers, and our success is heavily dependent on retaining this business and on our principal customers ability to maintain and grow their businesses. The loss or cancellation of business from our principal customers, including due to the utilization of alternative sources of products, whether through other distributors or increased self-distribution, closures of stores, reductions in the amount of products that our customers sell to their customers, operational issues or our failure to comply with the terms of our distribution agreements, where applicable, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, our largest customer accounted for approximately 23 of our Net sales in fiscal 2024. We serve as the primary distributor of natural, organic and specialty non-perishable products, and also distribute certain specialty protein, cheese, culinary items, deli items and products from health, beauty and supplement categories to this customer under the terms of our distribution agreement, which expires on May 20, 2032. A loss or significant decrease in volume with our largest customer could impact our ability to efficiently serve other, smaller customers in these categories who utilize these distribution centers. Our ability to maintain a close, mutually beneficial relationship with our principal customers is an important element to our continued growth. Similarly, if our largest customer diverts some or all of its purchases from us, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Our business is characterized by low margins, which are sensitive to inflationary and deflationary pressures, and intense competition and consolidation in the grocery industry, and our inability to maintain or increase our operating margins could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 The grocery industry is characterized by a relatively high volume of sales with relatively low profit margins, and as competition in certain areas intensifies and the industry continues to consolidate, our results of operations may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales and reduction in gross margin dollars. The grocery business is intensely competitive and the landscape is dynamic and continues to evolve, including from some competitors that have greater financial and other resources than we do. Consumers also have more choices for grocery and consumable purchases, including mass merchandisers, eCommerce providers, deep discount retailers, limited assortment stores, wholesale membership clubs and meal-delivery services, which may reduce the demand for products supplied by our wholesale customers. We may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. 
 
 Our ability to compete successfully is largely dependent on our ability to provide quality products and services at competitive prices. Our competition comes from a variety of sources, including other distributors, as well as specialty or independent grocery and mass market grocery distributors and cooperatives, and customers with their own distribution channels. Mass market grocery distributors, many with substantially greater financial and other resources than us and that may be better established in their markets, continue to increase their offerings of natural and organic products, resulting in more direct competition with our natural and organic product offerings. While natural and organic products typically generate higher margins, these margins could be affected by changes in the public s perception of the benefits of natural and organic products compared to similar conventional products. 
 
 In addition, many supermarket chains have increased self-distribution or purchases of items directly from suppliers. Relatively low barriers to entry have led to the emergence of alternative business models and channels in our markets. We also encounter indirect competition as a result of the fact that our customers with physical locations compete with online retailers and distributors that seek to sell certain products directly to consumers. Further, club stores, commercial wholesale outlets, direct food wholesalers and online food retailers have developed lower cost structures, creating increased pressure on the industry s profit margins. Our current or potential competitors may provide products or services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements. It is also possible that alliances among competitors may develop and that competitors may rapidly acquire significant market share. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, lost business and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 The continuing consolidation of retailers, the growth of chains and closures of grocery locations may reduce our gross margins in the future should more customers qualify for greater volume discounts, and should we experience pricing pressure from suppliers and retailers. Sales to some of our largest customers generate a lower gross margin than do sales to our smaller customers due to agreements that include volume discounts with many of these customers, including our largest customer. Increased sales to these customers results in downward pressure on our gross margins, which may or may not be offset by increases in sales or a reduction in expenses incurred to service these customers.

If we are not able to capture scale efficiencies and enhance our merchandise offerings, we may not be able to achieve our goals with respect to our operating margins. In addition, if we are not able to refine and improve our systems continually or effectively implement improvements to our systems without disruption, including any information technology migration to a cloud environment, we may not be able to reduce costs, increase sales and services, effectively manage inventory and procurement processes, or effectively manage customer pricing plans. As a result, our operating margins may stagnate or decline. 
 
 Further, because many of our sales are at prices that are based on our product cost plus a percentage markup, volatile food costs have a direct impact upon our profitability. We have experienced volatile levels of inflation during the past few years, which has had varying impacts on our business. For example, we experienced negative impacts on our profitability as inflation slowed in recent years and decreased the positive impact of inflation-related buying activities. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation and periods of rapidly increasing inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and results of operations to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers, or to the extent our operating expenses increase. In addition, product cost inflation may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending trends and reduce the demand for higher-margin natural and organic products, which could adversely affect profitability. Conversely, our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of slowing inflation or product cost deflation even though our Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales may remain relatively constant. If we are unable to reduce our expenses as a percentage of Net sales, including our expenses related to servicing this lower gross margin business, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. 
 
 We may not realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives. 
 
 Our long-term strategy is centered on adding value to our customers and suppliers through our expansive assortment of products, services, programs and insights that help them grow and compete. Simultaneously, we are working to improve free cash flow by focusing on what we can control around the areas of network optimization, reduced levels of capital intensity and optimization of our cost structure. The successful design, implementation and management of these initiatives may present significant challenges, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the initiatives may not advance our business strategy as expected. We may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, or may not realize the anticipated benefits within the expected time frame, due to financial or operational challenges, delays, lower than expected levels of customer and supplier acceptance and implementation or unexpected costs. Any failure to implement the initiatives in accordance with expectations could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated revenue and profitability benefits. In addition, the complexity of the initiatives requires a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully implement operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives. These and related demands on its resources may divert the Company s attention from existing core businesses and could also have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 Changes in relationships with our suppliers may adversely affect our profitability, and conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and alter our product costs. 
 
 As a wholesaler, we are dependent upon the consistent supply of products from manufacturers. We maintain supply contracts to fulfill product sales obligations to our customers. Manufacturers disruptions in their ability to produce, maintain and supply product based on changing levels of demand could result in an inability to fulfill our obligations to our customers.

 The majority of our suppliers are based in the United States and Canada, but we also source products from suppliers throughout the world. For the most part, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us. Although our purchasing volume can provide benefits, suppliers may not provide the products needed by us in the quantities or at the prices requested. For example, we experienced higher than usual levels of out-of-stocks leading to reduced fill rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. These shortages caused us to incur higher operating expenses due to the cost of moving products between our distribution facilities to maintain expected service levels, and we cannot anticipate whether this trend will recur in the future. We are also subject to supply chain uncertainties and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control. These conditions include work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers, short-term weather conditions or more prolonged climate change, crop conditions, product recalls, water shortages, transportation interruptions, unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs, competitive demands, raw material shortages, geopolitical disruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic events (including, but not limited to food-borne illnesses). As the consumer demand for natural and organic products has increased, certain retailers and other producers have entered the market and attempted to buy certain raw materials directly, limiting availability for use in certain of our suppliers products. In addition, increased costs of imported goods, including due to tariffs, import restrictions, global conflict or otherwise, may reduce customer demand for affected products if the parties experiencing those increased costs increase their prices. 
 
 We cooperatively engage in and support a variety of promotional programs and services with our suppliers. We manage these programs and services to increase sales while maintaining or improving our margins. We experienced a reduction in promotional spending and payment of slotting fees for new products by our suppliers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including decreased promotional forward-buying opportunities, and we may experience further reductions or changes in promotional spending (including as a result of the increasing attractiveness of alternative retail channels), which could have a significant impact on our profitability. We depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices, and we benefit from our ability to purchase product in advance of price increases. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and suppliers could change the terms upon which they sell to us, the services they request from us or discontinue selling to us altogether. 
 
 Further, increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions, or other factors which may be the result of climate change, also could impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. For example, in the past, weather patterns or events, such as lower than average levels of precipitation in key agricultural states or wildfires in the West, have affected prices of food products of certain of our suppliers. Input costs could increase at any time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period. Conversely, weather patterns could lead to a decline in our product costs (for example, if rainfall levels are abundant), particularly in our perishable and produce businesses, and this product cost deflation could negatively impact our results of operations. Our inability to obtain adequate products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations to customers, and these customers may turn to other distributors. In that case, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Failure by us to develop and operate a reliable technology platform and the costs of maintaining secure and effective information technology systems could negatively impact our business, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in information technology. 
 
 Our ability to decrease costs and increase profits, as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively, depends on the reliability of our technology platform. We use software and other technology systems, among other things, to send, receive, generate and select orders, load and route trucks and monitor and manage our business on a day-to-day basis. Failure to have adequate technology systems across the enterprise and any disruption to these systems could adversely impact our customer service, decrease the volume of our business, and result in increased costs negatively affecting our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 In our attempt to reduce operating expenses, increase operating efficiencies and better serve our customers and suppliers, we have invested and continue to invest in the development and implementation of new information technology. We are in the process of converting our existing facilities into a single warehouse management and supply chain platform. In addition, we remain focused on the automation of certain distribution centers and plan to develop further digital solutions for our customers, suppliers and associates. We may not be able to implement these technological enhancements at all or in the anticipated time frame and delays in implementation could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the costs may exceed our estimates and are expected to exceed the benefits during the early stages of implementation. Even if implementation progresses in accordance with our current plans, and within our current cost estimates, we may not achieve the expected efficiencies and cost savings from our investments. Moreover, as we implement information technology enhancements, disruptions in our business may be created (including disruption with our customers), which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We face risks related to the availability of qualified labor, labor costs and labor relations. 
 
 In the past, we have experienced a shortage of qualified labor. Recruiting and retention efforts, and actions to increase productivity, may not be successful. Such a shortage could potentially increase labor costs, reduce profitability or decrease our ability to effectively serve customers. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits of our efforts to improve labor efficiency, including through automation and other technology initiatives, or to increase productivity and efficiency through other methods, we may be more susceptible to labor shortages than our competitors. We have incurred increased costs to retain and address a shortage of qualified labor in certain geographies, particularly for warehouse workers and drivers, including wage actions, sign-on bonus programs, and increased use of third-party labor. 
 
 Because our labor costs are, as a percentage of Net sales, higher than in many other industries, we may be significantly harmed by labor cost increases. Further, if we are unable to accurately predict and adjust our labor needs with respect to our sales volume, our cost of labor as a percentage of Net sales may increase. In addition, labor is a significant cost of many of our wholesale customers. Any increase in their labor costs, including any increases in costs as a result of increases in minimum wage requirements or wage competition, could reduce the profitability of our customers and reduce demand for the products we supply. Additionally, the terms of some of our collective bargaining agreements may limit our ability to increase efficiencies. 
 
 As of August 3, 2024, approximately 10,704 of our 28,333 employees (approximately 38 were covered by 48 collective bargaining agreements, including existing agreements under negotiation, which expire through June 1, 2029. In the event we are unable to negotiate reasonable contract renewals with our union associates or are required to make significant changes to terms that are unfavorable to us, our relationship with employees may become fractured, and we could be subject to work stoppages or additional expenses. In that event, it would be necessary for us to hire replacement workers or implement other business continuity contingency plans to continue to meet our obligations to our customers. The costs to hire replacement workers, employ effective security measures, and, if necessary, serve customers from alternative facilities, could negatively impact the profitability of any affected facility. Depending on the length of time of any work stoppage or if we are required to employ replacement workers and implement security measures these costs could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 We have been the focus of union-organizing efforts, and we believe it is likely that similar efforts will continue in the future. We are in the process of negotiating collective bargaining agreements with newly certified units. New contracts could have substantially less favorable terms than our existing contracts. 
 
 We may fail to realize the expected benefits of strategic transactions or fail to effectively integrate the businesses we acquire, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We have engaged in, and could continue to pursue, strategic transactions. Strategic transactions present significant challenges and risks relating to execution. 
 
 Our ability to achieve the expected benefits of strategic transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to effectively execute on our business strategies, integrate and manage the combined operations for acquisitions, retain customers and suppliers on terms similar to those in place prior to the transaction, achieve desired operating efficiencies and sales growth, optimize delivery routes, coordinate administrative and distribution functions, integrate management information systems, expand into new markets to include markets of the acquired business, retain our associates and retain and assimilate the acquired businesses employees and maintain our financial and internal controls and systems as we evolve our operations. Achieving the anticipated benefits of strategic transactions also depends on the adequacy of our implementation plans and the ability of management to oversee and operate effectively any changes to the operations. 
 
 Our growth plans may not produce the results that we expect. 
 
 Our future growth may be limited by our ability to optimize our network of distribution centers to serve our customers, retain existing customers, successfully integrate acquired entities or significant new customers, implement information systems and automation initiatives, or adequately manage our personnel. If we fail to optimize the volume of supply operations in our distribution center network, do not retain existing business or do not utilize added network capacity in line with our expectations, excess capacity may exist, which may lead to inefficiencies and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, including as a result of incurring operating costs for these facilities without sufficient corresponding sales revenue to cover these costs.

 If we are unable to successfully optimize our distribution center network or open additional distribution centers in new or existing markets if needed to accommodate or facilitate growth or if our distribution centers have increased operational challenges it could have a material impact on our ability to grow. Our ability to compete effectively, maintain service levels and manage future growth, if any, will depend on our ability to maximize operational efficiencies across our distribution center network, to implement and improve on a timely basis operational, financial and management information systems, including our warehouse management systems, and to expand, train, motivate and manage our work force. Our existing personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support the future growth of our operations. In addition, we have recently appointed new executive leaders, and these transitions may be disruptive. Our inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Further, a key element of our current growth strategy is to increase the amount of differentiated products that we distribute and services that we offer. We believe that the ability to distribute these products and offer these services will distinguish us from our competitors and increase demand for our products. If we are unable to increase these differentiated products and services, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Our wholesale distribution and services businesses could be adversely affected if we are not able to attract new customers, increase sales to or retain existing customers or if our customers are unable to grow their businesses. 
 
 The profitability of our wholesale segment is dependent upon sufficient volume to support our operating infrastructure. The inability to attract new customers or the loss of existing customers from a decision to use alternative sources of distribution, whether through a competing wholesaler or by converting to self-distribution, or due to retail closure or industry consolidation may negatively impact our sales and operating margins. If there were a rapid reduction in demand for the products we distribute or services we offer, our results and cash flows may be negatively impacted if we are unable to reduce working capital maintained to support current sales levels. 
 
 Our success also depends in part on the financial success and cooperation of our wholesale customers. They may not experience an acceptable level of sales or profitability, and our revenues and gross margins could be negatively affected as a result. We may also need to extend credit to our wholesale customers. While we seek to obtain security interests and other credit support in connection with the financial accommodations we extend, such collateral may not be sufficient to cover our exposure. Additionally, in the past we have entered into wholesale customer support arrangements to guaranty or subsidize real estate obligations, which make us contingently liable in the event our wholesale customers default. If sales trends or profitability worsen for wholesale customers, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, lost business for us, delayed or reduced payments to us or defaults on payments or other liabilities owed by wholesale customers to us, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to grow our wholesale business. In this regard, our wholesale customers are affected by the same economic conditions, including food inflation and deflation, and competition that our retail segment faces. The magnitude of these risks increases as the size of our wholesale customers increases. 
 
 Many of our customers are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us, and larger customers that have multiyear contracts with us may terminate these contracts early in certain situations or choose not to renew or extend these contracts at expiration. 
 
 Many of our wholesale customers buy from us under purchase orders, and we generally do not have written agreements with or long-term commitments from these customers for the purchase of products. We cannot assure you that these customers will maintain or increase their orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base. Decreases in volumes or orders for products supplied by us for these customers with whom we do not have a long-term contract may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 We may have contracts with certain of our customers (as is the case with many of our chain customers) that obligate the customer to buy products from us for a particular period of time. Even in this case, the contracts may not require the customer to purchase a minimum number of products from us or the contracts may afford the customer better pricing in the event that the volume of the customer s purchases exceeds certain levels. If these customers were to terminate or fail to perform under these contracts prior to their scheduled termination, or if we or the customer elected not to renew or extend the term of the contract at its expiration or not to renew or extend at historical purchase levels, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including additional operational expenses to transition out of the business or to adjust our facilities and staffing costs to cover the reduction in Net sales.

 Disruptions to our or third-party information technology systems, including cyber-attacks and security breaches, and the costs of maintaining secure and effective information technology systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations . 
 
 The efficient operation of our businesses is highly dependent on computer hardware and software systems, including customized information technology systems. Additionally, our businesses increasingly involve the receipt, storage and transmission of sensitive data, including personal information about our customers, employees, and vendors and our proprietary business information. We also share information with vendors. Information technology systems are vulnerable to not functioning as designed and to disruptions and security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists, which risks may be more pronounced as associates continue to work remotely. 
 
 Although we continue to take actions to strengthen the security of our information technology systems, these measures and technology may not adequately anticipate or prevent security breaches in the future or we may not be able to timely implement these measures and technology. Cyber-attacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly frequent, sophisticated and difficult to detect. The failure to promptly detect, determine the extent of, appropriately respond to, and contain a significant data security attack or breach of our systems or any third-party system used by us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any such failure also could result in the loss of credibility with our customers and damage to our reputation and future sales, including through negative publicity. In addition, the unavailability of information technology systems or failure of these systems or software to perform as anticipated for any reason, including a ransomware attack, and any inability to respond to, or recover from, such an event, could disrupt our business, impact our customers and result in decreased performance, increased overhead costs and increased risk for liability, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. 
 
 We have experienced losses due to the uncollectibility of accounts in the past and could experience losses in the future if our customers are unable to timely pay their debts to us. 
 
 Certain of our customers have from time to time experienced bankruptcy, insolvency or an inability to pay their debts to us as they come due. If our customers suffer significant financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay their debts to us timely or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is possible that customers may reject their contractual obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise. Significant customer bankruptcies could further adversely affect our revenues and increase our Operating expenses by requiring larger provisions for bad debt. In addition, even when our contracts with these customers are not rejected in bankruptcy, if customers are unable to meet their obligations on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our ability to collect receivables. Further, we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extended financing terms with these customers in such a situation, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 During periods of economic weakness, small to medium-sized businesses, like many of our independent channel customers, may be impacted more severely and more quickly than larger businesses. Similarly, these smaller businesses may be more likely to be more severely impacted by events outside of their control, like macro-economic shifts or significant weather events. Consequently, the ability of such businesses to make payments to us may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Increases in healthcare, pension and other costs under the Company s single employer benefit plan and multiemployer benefit plans could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We provide single employer and multiemployer health, defined benefit pension and defined contribution benefits to many of our employees and, in some cases, former employees. The costs of such benefits continue to increase, and the extent of any increase depends on a number of different factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include governmental regulations such as The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which resulted in changes to the U.S. healthcare system and imposes mandatory types of coverage, reporting and other requirements; return on plan assets; changes in actuarial valuations, estimates, or assumptions used to determine our benefit obligations for certain benefit plans, which require the use of significant estimates, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and the rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs; for multiemployer plans, the outcome of collective bargaining and actions taken by trustees who manage the plans; and potential changes to applicable legislation or regulation. If we are unable to control these benefits and costs, we may experience increased operating costs, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

 Additionally, certain multiemployer pension plans in which we participate are underfunded with the projected benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of those plans assets, in certain cases, by a wide margin. If a withdrawal were to occur, the withdrawal liability from our multiemployer plans could be material, our efforts to mitigate these liabilities may not be successful, and potential exposure to withdrawal liabilities could cause us to forgo or negatively impact our ability to enter into other business opportunities. Some of these plans have required rehabilitation plans or funding improvement plans, and we can give no assurances of the extent to which a rehabilitation plan or a funding improvement plan will improve the funded status of the plan. It is possible that increases of unfunded liabilities of the multiemployer pension plans would result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers over the next several years. Any changes to our pension plans that would impact associates covered by collective bargaining agreements will be subject to negotiation, which may limit our ability to manage our exposure to these plans. A significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The financial condition of these pension plans may also negatively impact our debt ratings, which may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access financial markets. 
 
 Activist investors could negatively impact our business and cause disruptions to our operations. 
 
 We value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our stockholders regarding strategy and performance. Activist stockholders who disagree with the composition of the Board of Directors, our strategy or the way the Company is managed may seek to effect change through various strategies and channels, such as through commencing a proxy contest, making public statements critical of our performance or business or engaging in other similar activities. 
 
 Responding to such actions by activist investors can be costly and time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management, our Board of Directors and our employees, and our ability to execute our strategic plan could also be impaired as a result. For example, we have been required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial and other advisory fees. In the event of an activist campaign, we could be required to incur substantially increased legal, public relations and other advisory fees and proxy solicitation expenses. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist investors may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new or retain existing investors, customers, directors, employees, collaborators or other partners, disrupt relationships with the Company, and the market price of our common stock could also experience periods of increased volatility as a result. 
 
 Our insurance and self-insurance programs may not be adequate to cover future claims. 
 
 We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities, including workers compensation, general and auto liability, director and officer liability, property risk, cyber and privacy risks and employee healthcare benefits. We believe that our insurance coverage is customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not commercially reasonable to insure. These losses, should they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the cost of insurance fluctuates based upon our historical trends, market conditions, and availability. In response to the current market, we have also increased deductibles and increased percentages of loss retention above the deductible for certain of our policies, which could expose us to higher costs in the event of a claim. 
 
 We estimate the liabilities and required reserves associated with the risks we retain. Any such estimates and actuarial projection of losses is subject to a considerable degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines, severity of injuries and accidents, vocation rehabilitation and apportionment and unpredictable external factors affecting inflation rates, discount rates, rising healthcare costs, litigation trends, legal interpretations, and actual claim settlement patterns. If actual losses incurred are greater than those anticipated, our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. If we suffer a substantial loss that exceeds our self-insurance reserves and any excess insurance coverage, the loss and attendant expenses could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 
 The cost of the capital available to us and limitations on our ability to access additional capital may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Historically, acquisitions and capital expenditures have been a large component of our growth. We anticipate that capital expenditures will continue to be, and acquisitions may be, important to our growth in the future. As a result, increases in the cost of capital available to us, which could result from volatility in the credit markets, downgrades of our credit ratings, our not being in compliance with restrictive covenants under our debt agreements or our inability to access additional capital to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to grow our business organically or through acquisitions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, our profit margins depend on strategic buying initiatives, such as discounted bulk purchases, which require spending significant amounts of working capital up-front to purchase products that we then sell over a multi-month time period. Increases in the cost of capital or our inability to access additional capital on satisfactory terms could restrict our ability to engage in strategic buying initiatives, which could reduce our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility. 
 
 Our debt agreements, including the loan agreement (the ABL Loan Agreement related to our 2,730 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility entered into in June 2022, as amended, and the term loan agreement (the Term Loan Agreement related to our 500 million term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility entered into on October 22, 2018, as amended, and the indenture governing our unsecured 6.750 Senior Notes due October 15, 2028 (the Senior Notes contain financial covenants and other restrictions that limit our operating flexibility and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business. These restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business if we were not subject to these limitations and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. 
 
 In addition, our ABL Loan Agreement, Term Loan Agreement and the indenture governing the Senior Notes require that we comply with various financial tests and impose certain restrictions on us, including among other things, restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make loans or investments, or return capital to stockholders through share repurchases or paying dividends. Failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 
 Impairment charges for long-lived assets could adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We monitor the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as buildings, equipment and leased assets, and evaluate their carrying value for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. If the review performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the long-lived assets, in the period the determination is made. The testing of long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment requires us to make estimates that are subject to significant assumptions about our future revenue, profitability, cash flows, fair value of assets and liabilities, and weighted average cost of capital, as well as other assumptions. Changes in these estimates, or changes in actual performance compared with these estimates, may affect the fair value of long-lived assets, which may result in an impairment charge. 
 
 We cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment. Should the value of long-lived assets become impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

 Economic Risks 
 
 Changes in consumer purchasing habits could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Changes in consumer purchasing habits may reduce demand for certain of the products we distribute. Consumer habits could be affected by a number of factors, including an increase in food-away-from home options, changes in attitudes regarding benefits of natural and organic products when compared to similar lower margin conventional products, new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods, changes in disposable income levels, which may be impacted by a reduction in the level of government spending that supports grocery purchases, or other macro trends. For example, we experienced declines in certain of our sales channels as a result of changes in consumer purchasing habits related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including reductions in foodservice, bulk snacks, seeds and nuts and international categories, and we cannot be certain how consumer habits may continue to evolve. Further, in a sustained economic downturn, consumers may shift their purchases to lower-cost, lower-margin products. Although there is a growing consumer preference for sustainable, organic and locally grown products, which are higher margin products, there can be no assurance that such trend will continue. Changing consumer preferences also result from generational shifts, including younger generations seeking new and different foods, as well as more multi-cultural menu options and menu innovation. However, there can be no assurance that such trends will continue. If consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. Additionally, if we are not able to effectively respond to changes in consumer perceptions or adapt our product offerings to new or developing trends in eating habits, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could suffer. 
 
 Our leverage and debt service obligations increase our sensitivity to the effects of economic downturns and could adversely affect our business. 
 
 As of August 3, 2024, we had approximately 2.1 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Our leverage, and any increase therein, could have important potential consequences, including, but not limited to: 
 
 increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility in planning for and responding to, adverse general economic and industry conditions and changes in our business and the competitive environment and placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors that are less leveraged; 
 requiring us to use a substantial portion of operating cash flow to pay principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, instead of other purposes, such as funding working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, returning capital to stockholders through dividends or share repurchases or other corporate purposes; 
 increasing our vulnerability to downgrades of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, and access to capital markets; 
 restricting us from making desired strategic acquisitions in the future or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; 
 increasing our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates insofar as current and future borrowings are subject to variable rates of interest; 
 making it more difficult for us to repay, refinance, or satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness; 
 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing; and 
 imposing restrictive covenants on our operations, which could result in an event of default if we are unable to comply, and absent any cure or waiver of such default ultimately could result in the acceleration of the such debt and potentially other debt with cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. 
 
 There is no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, however, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

 Disruption of our distribution network or to the operations of our customers could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Damage or disruption to our distribution capabilities due to weather, including extreme or prolonged weather conditions, natural disaster, fire, civil unrest, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, product recalls or safety concerns generally, crop conditions, availability of key commodities, regulatory actions, disruptions in technology, the financial and/or operational instability of key suppliers, performance by outsourced service providers, transportation interruptions, labor supply or stoppages or vendor defaults or disputes, or other reasons could impair our ability to distribute our products. To the extent that we are unable, or it is not financially feasible, to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 In addition, such disruption may interrupt or impede access to, or otherwise reduce the number of consumers who visit, our customers facilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Increased fuel costs may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations. Both the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Higher costs for diesel fuel can increase the price we pay for products as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, including costs of inbound goods from our suppliers. These factors, in turn, may negatively impact our Net sales, margins, operating expenses and operating results. To the extent we do not enter into commodity derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our projected diesel fuel requirements, our exposure to volatility in the price of diesel fuel would increase relative to our exposure to volatility in periods in which we have outstanding commodity derivative contracts. We also maintain a fuel program with certain customers, which allows us to pass some of the changes in fuel costs through to those customers. If fuel costs continue to increase in the future, we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 
 We are subject to significant governmental regulation and failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Our business is highly regulated at the federal, state, and local levels, and our products and distribution operations require various licenses, permits and approvals. For example: 
 
 The products that we distribute in the United States are subject to inspection by the United States Food and Drug Administration. 
 Our warehouse and distribution centers are subject to inspection by the United States Department of Agriculture, the United States Department of Labor Occupational and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and various state health and workplace safety authorities. 
 Our United States trucking operations are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation and the United States Federal Highway Administration. 
 
 In addition, the various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices to which we are subject require us to comply with numerous provisions regulating areas such as environmental, health and sanitation standards, food safety, marketing of natural or organically produced food, facilities, pharmacies, equal employment opportunity, public accessibility, employee benefits, wages and hours worked and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, tobacco and alcoholic beverages, among others. For example:

Table of Contents 

 Environmental, Health and Safety : Our operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, the disposal of food by-products, the handling, treatment, and disposal of wastes, maintenance of refrigeration systems, and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Compliance with existing or changing environmental and safety requirements, including more stringent limitations imposed or expected to be imposed in any recently renewed or soon-to-be renewed environmental permits, may require capital expenditures. Additionally, concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant United States and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Increased regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions, particularly with respect to diesel engine emissions, could result in substantial additional operating expenses. These expenses may include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our vehicles sooner than planned. Until the timing, scope and extent of such regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our results of operations. It is reasonably possible, however, that it could result in material costs, which we may be unable to pass on to our customers. 
 
 Further, our business may be subject to climate-related transition risks, which arise from society s transition toward a low-carbon economy due to changes in laws or regulations, technological advancements, and investor and consumer sentiment. We also have announced third-party validated emissions reduction targets covering our operations and value chain. While many of our initiatives will create efficiencies and return on investment, the transition to a low-carbon economy generally and our own efforts to reduce emissions could lead to increased costs to transition to or invest in renewable energy sources, including electric vehicles, increased compliance costs, including tracking and reporting systems, and increased costs of products, commodities and energy. 
 
 Food Safety and Marketing : There is significant governmental scrutiny, regulations and public awareness regarding food quality and food and drug safety. We may be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the food we manufacture or the food and drug products we distribute. In addition, we are subject to governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety and the sale, packaging, and marketing of natural and organic products. Compliance with these laws may impose a significant burden on our operations. 
 
 Wage Rates and Paid Leave : Changes in federal, state or local minimum wage and overtime laws or employee paid leave laws could cause us to incur additional wage costs, which could adversely affect our operating margins. Failure to comply with existing or new laws or regulations could result in significant damages, penalties and/or litigation costs. 
 
 Information Security : As a merchant that accepts debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard PCI DSS ), issued by the PCI Council. Additionally, we are subject to PCI DSS as a service provider, which is a business entity that is not a payment brand directly involved in the processing, storage or transmission of cardholder data. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. By accepting debit cards for payment, we are also subject to compliance with American National Standards Institute data encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines. The cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws, standards and guidelines, including evolving PCI DSS standards, and developing, maintaining, and upgrading technology systems to address future advances in technology, could be significant and we could experience problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems. Failure to comply with such laws, standards, and guidelines, or payment card industry standards such as those involving MasterCard, Visa and Europay (EMV) transactions, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Foreign Operations : Our supplier base includes domestic and foreign suppliers. In addition, we have customers located outside the United States. Accordingly, laws and regulations affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, or changes in the enforcement of those laws and regulations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are required to comply with laws and regulations governing export controls, and ethical, anti-bribery and similar business practices such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our Canadian operations are similarly subject to extensive regulation, including the English and French dual labeling requirements applicable to products that we distribute in Canada. The loss or revocation of any existing licenses, permits, or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses, permits, or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

 Pharmacy : We are required to meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, record keeping and distribution of controlled substances. During the past several years, the United States healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels. For example, in 2019, the Company settled with the Drug Enforcement Administration alleged violations of the Controlled Substances Act relating to an administrative subpoena received by Supervalu that requested, among other things, information on the Company s pharmacy policies and procedures generally, as well as the production of documents that are required to be kept and maintained pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations. 
 
 The failure to comply or maintain compliance with applicable governmental laws and regulations, including those referred to above and in Item 1. Business - Government Regulation of this Annual Report, could result in, among other things, administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or fines; mandatory or voluntary product recalls; warning or other letters; cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance; closure of facilities or operations; the loss, revocation, or modification of any existing licenses, permits, registrations or approvals; the failure to obtain additional licenses, permits, registrations or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business; or the loss of our ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. These laws and regulations may change in the future. We cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine the effect that additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on our future business. We may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or due to any required product recalls. 
 
 In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations, including those referred to above, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, prohibitions on exporting, seizures, or debarments from contracting with the U.S. or Canadian governments. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance, including debarments, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations. 
 
 Product liability claims could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We face a risk of exposure to product liability claims if the products we sell or manufacture cause injury or illness. In addition, meat, seafood, cheese, poultry and other products that we distribute could be subject to recall because they are, or are alleged to be, contaminated, spoiled or inappropriately labeled. Our meat and poultry products may be subject to contamination by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella and generic E. coli. These pathogens are generally found in the environment, and as a result, there is a risk that they, as a result of food processing, could be present in the meat and poultry products we distribute. These pathogens can also be introduced as a result of improper handling at the consumer level. These risks may be controlled, although not eliminated, by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing. We have little, if any, control over proper handling before we receive the product or once the product has been shipped to our customers. Any events that give rise to actual or potential food contamination, drug contamination or food-borne illness or injury, or events that give rise to claims that our products are not of the quality or composition claimed to be, may result in product liability claims from individuals, consumers and governmental agencies, penalties and enforcement actions from government agencies, a loss of consumer confidence, harm to our reputation and could cause production and delivery disruptions, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 In addition, if we were to manufacture or distribute foods that are or are perceived to be unsafe, contaminated, or defective, it may be necessary for us to recall such products, or we may recall products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards. Any resulting product recalls could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have, and the companies we have acquired have had, liability insurance with respect to product liability claims. This insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or at all and may not be adequate to cover product liability claims against us or against companies we have acquired. 
 
 We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers and manufacturers, but any such indemnification is limited to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party. We may be subject to liability, which could be substantial, because of actual or alleged contamination in products manufactured or sold by us, including products sold by companies before we acquired them. If we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability claims and costs associated with product recalls, including a loss of business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could harm our business. 
 
 We rely on a combination of trademark, service mark, trade secret, copyright and domain name law and internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. We believe our trademarks, private label products and domain names are valuable assets. However, our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and to provide us with a competitive advantage. From time to time, third parties may use names, logos and slogans similar to ours, may apply to register trademarks or domain names similar to ours, and may infringe or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted against such third parties or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Asserting or defending our intellectual property rights could be time consuming and costly and could distract management s attention and resources. If we are unable to prevent our competitors from using names, logos, slogans and domain names similar to ours, consumer confusion could result, the perception of our brands and products could be negatively affected and our sales and profitability could suffer as a result. In addition, if our wholesale customers receive negative publicity or fail to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with our trademarks, our rights to, and the value of, our trademarks could potentially be harmed. Failure to protect our proprietary information could also have an adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We may also be subject to claims that our activities or the products we sell infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management s attention and resources, even if the claims are without merit, and may prevent us from using our trademarks in certain geographies or in connection with certain products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 
 We have established policies and processes for assessing, identifying and managing risks from cybersecurity threats based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST cybersecurity framework. Our technology environment is regularly assessed, both internally and through the use of third parties, against the six NIST principles (identify, detect, protect, recover, respond, govern) to oversee and identify the likelihood and impact of risks from cybersecurity threats. Additionally, we apply these principles where appropriate to third-party technology providers. We also utilize third parties to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity program on a periodic basis, which includes engaging cybersecurity assessors and cybersecurity experts to assist in the detection, verification and validation of risks from cybersecurity threats, as well as to support associated mitigation plans when necessary. We have a cybersecurity incident response plan in place to assist us in detecting, analyzing, containing, responding to and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. We also maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage to protect against certain potential losses arising from cybersecurity incidents. 
 
 We have identified and as a result monitor cybersecurity as an enterprise risk of the Company. We have an Information Security Steering Committee that meets quarterly to review the cybersecurity threat landscape, current risks, incidents and program management. We routinely assess the cybersecurity threat landscape, including any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through our information systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information systems or any information residing therein. 
 
 Our Chief Information Security Officer CISO leads a dedicated cybersecurity team responsible for policy, governance, vulnerability management, architecture and incident response. Our team monitors and tests our cybersecurity policies and procedures through methods such as periodic reviews, targeted assessments and tabletop exercises. All personnel with access to UNFI systems are made aware of our cybersecurity policies and procedures upon hire and through periodic refresher trainings. Such policies and procedures cover areas such as identity and access management, vendor management, data governance and protection, vulnerability management, incident response, recovery, communications and cybersecurity hygiene.

 We have not experienced any cybersecurity incidents that have materially impacted or are likely to materially impact our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition based on information known to us as of the date of this Annual Report. Although we cannot eliminate all potential threats, our cybersecurity program is operated in a manner to minimize the likelihood of any threat becoming material and to keep pace with a constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape. For more information on risks from cybersecurity threats, refer to the risks described under Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report. 
 
 Governance 
 
 Board s Role in Oversight of Risks from Cybersecurity Threats 
 
 Our Board of Directors has appointed the Audit Committee to assist in fulfilling its responsibilities with respect to the oversight of cybersecurity, data privacy and information technology. Several of our Directors, including certain members of our Audit Committee, have backgrounds or professional experience in risk management, digital platforms, information technology or cybersecurity and meet regularly with members of our management team to advise on cybersecurity matters and technology initiatives. 
 
 Our Chief Information Officer CIO ), CISO and other members of management provide quarterly updates to the Audit Committee and meet with the Board of Directors at least annually regarding risks related to information systems, information security and cybersecurity. Specific topics may include updates to the Company s strategy to combat cybersecurity risks; cybersecurity news and events; key focus areas; the threat landscape; and the results of certain assessments and testing. Our CIO, CISO or other members of management provide information to the Audit Committee or our Board of Directors, as applicable, pursuant to risk-based escalation protocols for cybersecurity incidents in accordance with an established materiality framework. 
 
 Management s Role in Assessing and Managing Material Risks from Cybersecurity Threats 
 
 The information security function is led by our CISO, under the direction of our CIO. Our CISO, who has been serving in this position since January 2020, has over 20 years of experience in information security and is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional. Our CISO maintains primary responsibility for developing cybersecurity strategies; cybersecurity governance; identifying, assessing and monitoring cybersecurity risks; preparing for and responding to cybersecurity incidents; verification and testing of cybersecurity; and disaster recovery governance. Our CISO may authorize specific Company associates to assist in managing these responsibilities if determined necessary, including the Crisis Response Team. Our CIO and CISO have oversight responsibilities of the Company s cybersecurity program. 
 
 We conduct a regular cybersecurity risk assessment process through our CISO and dedicated information security team, which reports to the Information Security Steering Committee. This committee meets at least quarterly to review current program progress and discuss and evaluate risks that could be material to our business, including cybersecurity threats. The Information Security Steering Committee is comprised of key leadership across the Company to support cross-functional representation.

 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. In some cases you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, seek, should, will and would, or similar words. Statements that contain these words and other statements that are forward-looking in nature should be read carefully because they discuss future expectations, contain projections of future results of operations or of financial positions or state other forward-looking information. 
 
 Forward-looking statements involve inherent uncertainty and may ultimately prove to be incorrect. These statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions, which are based on currently available information. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or actual operating results. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to: 
 
 our dependence on principal customers; 
 the relatively low margins of our business, which are sensitive to inflationary and deflationary pressures and intense competition, including as a result of the continuing consolidation of retailers and the growth of consumer choices for grocery and consumable purchases; 
 our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives; 
 changes in relationships with our suppliers; 
 our ability to operate, and rely on third parties to operate, reliable and secure technology systems; 
 labor and other workforce shortages and challenges; 
 the addition or loss of significant customers or material changes to our relationships with these customers; 
 our ability to realize anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; 
 our ability to continue to grow sales, including of our higher margin natural and organic foods and non-food products; 
 our ability to maintain sufficient volume in our wholesale distribution and services businesses to support our operating infrastructure; 
 our ability to access additional capital; 
 increases in healthcare, pension and other costs under our single employer benefit plan and multiemployer benefit plans; 
 the potential for additional asset impairment charges; 
 our sensitivity to general economic conditions including inflation, changes in disposable income levels and consumer purchasing habits;

 our ability to timely and successfully deploy our warehouse management system throughout our distribution centers and our transportation management system across the Company and to achieve efficiencies and cost savings from these efforts; 
 the potential for disruptions in our supply chain or our distribution capabilities from circumstances beyond our control, including due to lack of long-term contracts, severe weather, labor shortages or work stoppages or otherwise; 
 moderated supplier promotional activity, including decreased forward buying opportunities; 
 union-organizing activities that could cause labor relations difficulties and increased costs; 
 our ability to maintain food quality and safety; and 
 volatility in fuel costs. 
 
 You should carefully review the risks described under Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A, as well as any other cautionary language in this Annual Report, as the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect, which may be material, on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 
 Business Overview 
 
 UNFI is a leading distributor of grocery and non-food products, and support services provider to retailers in the United States and Canada. We believe we are uniquely positioned to provide the broadest array of products and services to customers throughout North America. Our diversified customer base includes over 30,000 customer locations ranging from some of the largest grocers in the country to smaller independents as well. We offer approximately 250,000 products consisting of national, regional and private label brands grouped into the following main product categories: grocery and general merchandise; perishables; frozen foods; wellness and personal care items; and bulk and foodservice products. We believe we are North America s premier grocery wholesaler with 55 distribution centers and warehouses representing approximately 31 million square feet of warehouse space. We are a coast-to-coast distributor with customers in all 50 states as well as all ten provinces in Canada, making us a desirable partner for retailers and consumer product manufacturers. We believe our total product assortment and service offerings are unmatched by our wholesale competitors. We plan to continue to pursue new business opportunities with independent retailers that operate diverse formats, regional and national chains, as well as international customers with wide-ranging needs. Our business is classified into two reportable segments: Wholesale and Retail; and also includes a manufacturing division and a branded product line division. 
 
 We are focused on becoming a more effective and efficient business partner to our customers, which we believe will position us for long-term profitable growth. We have undertaken a new strategy and have established new three-year financial objectives that begin in fiscal 2025 and are designed to make us more efficient while improving free cash flow generation and reducing net leverage. Our strategy includes the areas of focus detailed under Business included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Annual Report. 
 
 During fiscal 2024, we continued to implement near-term initiatives to help improve profitability and strengthen our foundation while we finalized and began implementing our revised strategy. 
 
 We expect to continue to use available capital to re-invest in our business and are committed to improving our free cash flow and financial leverage while reducing outstanding debt. 
 
 We believe we can optimize our performance and profitability through our improvement efforts, which we expect will improve our cost structure, increase sales of products and services, and position us to provide tailored, data-driven solutions to help our customers run their businesses more efficiently and contribute to customer acquisitions. 
 
 Our largest customer accounted for more than 10 of our Net sales in fiscal 2024. On May 21, 2024, we amended and restated our distribution agreement with this customer which, among other things, extended the term of that agreement through May 20, 2032. 
 
 Trends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business 
 
 Our results are impacted by macroeconomic and demographic trends, changes in the food distribution market structure and changes in consumer behavior. We believe food-at-home expenditures as a percentage of total food expenditures are subject to these trends, including changes in consumer behaviors in response to social and economic trends, such as levels of disposable income and the health of the economy in which our customers and our stores operate. 
 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 The U.S. economy has experienced economic volatility in recent years, which has had, and we expect may continue to have, an impact on consumer confidence and behavior. Consumer spending may continue to be impacted by levels of discretionary income and consumers trading down to a less expensive mix of products for grocery items or buying fewer items. In addition, inflation continues to affect our business, and fluctuating commodity and labor input costs may continue to impact the prices of products we procure from manufacturers. We believe our product mix, which ranges from high-quality natural and organic products to national and local conventional brands, including cost conscious private label brands, positions us to serve a broad cross section of North American retailers and end customers, and may lessen the impact of any further shifts in consumer and industry trends in grocery product mix. 
 
 We are also impacted by changes in food distribution trends affecting our Wholesale customers, such as direct store deliveries and other methods of distribution. Our Wholesale customers manage their businesses independently and operate in a competitive environment. 
 
 Wholesale Distribution Network Optimization 
 
 We are making initial strides towards our network optimization goal by streamlining our distribution center network to create a more efficient supply chain and reduce capital intensity. Subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we began the consolidation of the volume of two distribution centers in the upper Midwest and their related off-site storage facilities into other facilities in the Central region. We expect to achieve synergies and cost savings as a result of these efforts through eliminating inefficiencies, including incurring lower operating, shrink and off-site storage expenses. 
 
 In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we began the development of our new Manchester, Pennsylvania distribution center, which has approximately 1.3 million square feet. We recognized a 205 million right-of-use asset and operating lease liability for this distribution center in fiscal 2024. Subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, in September 2024, we began operating this facility, and we expect to begin consolidating volume from other nearby distribution centers in the East region into this new distribution center in fiscal 2025. 
 
 We plan to continue to evaluate our distribution center network to further optimize performance and expect to incur incremental expenses related to any future network realignment, expansion or improvements, including network optimization and automation initiatives. We are working to both minimize these potential future costs and obtain new business to further improve the efficiency of our transforming distribution network. 
 
 Retail Operations 
 
 We currently operate 76 retail grocery stores, including 54 Cub Foods corporate stores and 22 Shoppers Food Warehouse stores. In addition, we supply another 26 Cub Foods stores operated by our Wholesale customers through franchise and equity ownership arrangements. We operate 81 pharmacies primarily within the stores we operate and the stores of our franchisees. In addition, we operate 24 Cub Wine and Spirit and Cub Liquor stores. 
 
 We plan to continue to invest in our Retail segment in areas such as customer-facing merchandising initiatives, physical facilities, technology and operational tools. Cub Foods and Shoppers Food Warehouse anticipate continued investment in improving the customer and associate experience through express remodels focused on customer facing elements. 
 
 Impact of Product Cost Changes 
 
 We experienced a mix of inflation and deflation across product categories during fiscal 2024. In the aggregate across our businesses, including the mix of products, management estimates our businesses experienced product cost inflation of approximately one percent in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. Cost inflation and deflation estimates are based on individual like items sold during the periods being compared. Changes in merchandising, customer buying habits and competitive pressures create inherent difficulties in measuring the impact of inflation and deflation on Net sales and Gross profit. Absent any changes in units sold or the mix of units sold, inflation generally has the effect of increasing sales. Under the last-in, first out LIFO method of inventory accounting, product cost increases are recognized within Cost of sales based on expected year-end inventory quantities and costs, which generally has the effect of decreasing Gross profit and the carrying value of inventory during periods of inflation. 
 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 Our pricing to our customers is determined at the time of sale primarily based on the then prevailing vendor listed base cost, and includes discounts we offer to our customers. Generally, in an inflationary environment as a wholesaler, rising vendor costs result in higher Net sales driven by higher vendor prices when other variables such as quantities sold and vendor promotions are constant. In fiscal 2024, we experienced fewer and less significant vendor product cost increases as compared to fiscal 2023. These decreases negatively impacted our gross profit rate when comparing fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2023. 
 
 Composition of Consolidated Statements of Operations and Business Performance Assessment 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 Our Net sales consist primarily of product sales of natural, organic, specialty, produce, and conventional grocery and non-food products, adjusted for customer volume discounts, vendor incentives when applicable, returns and allowances, and professional services revenue. Net sales also include amounts charged by us to customers for shipping and handling and fuel surcharges. 
 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Profit 
 
 The principal components of our Cost of sales include the amounts paid to suppliers for product sold, plus transportation costs necessary to bring the product to, or move product between, our distribution centers and retail stores, partially offset by consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase or promotion of the suppliers products. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses include distribution expenses of warehousing, delivery, purchasing, receiving, selecting, and outbound transportation expenses, and selling and administrative expenses. These expenses include salaries and wages, employee benefits, occupancy, insurance, depreciation and amortization expense and share-based compensation expense. 
 
 Restructuring, Acquisition and Integration Related Expenses 
 
 Restructuring, acquisition and integration related expenses reflect expenses resulting from restructuring activities, including severance costs, share-based compensation acceleration charges and acquisition and integration related expenses. Integration related expenses include certain professional consulting expenses and incremental expenses related to combining facilities required to optimize our distribution network as a result of acquisitions. 
 
 Loss (Gain) on Sale of Assets and Other Asset Charges 
 
 Loss (gain) on sale of assets and other asset charges primarily includes losses (gains) on sales of assets, losses on sales of financial assets, and asset impairments. 
 
 Net Periodic Benefit Income, Excluding Service Cost 
 
 Net periodic benefit income, excluding service cost reflects the recognition of expected returns on benefit plan assets and interest costs on plan liabilities. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net includes primarily interest expense on long-term debt, net of capitalized interest, loss on debt extinguishment, interest expense on finance lease obligations, amortization of financing costs and discounts, and interest income. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). In addition to the GAAP results, we consider certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess the performance of our business and understand underlying operating performance and core business trends, which we use to facilitate operating performance comparisons of our business on a consistent basis over time. Adjusted EBITDA is provided as a supplement to our results of operations and related analysis, and should not be considered superior to, a substitute for or an alternative to, any financial measure of performance prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items because they are non-cash items or items that do not reflect management s assessment of ongoing business performance. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it provides additional information regarding factors and trends affecting our business, which are used in the business planning process to understand expected operating performance, to evaluate results against those expectations, and because of its importance as a measure of underlying operating performance, as the primary compensation performance measure under certain compensation programs and plans. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is reflective of factors that affect our underlying operating performance and facilitate operating performance comparisons of our business on a consistent basis over time. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. Certain adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflected below exclude items that may be considered recurring in nature and may be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. These measurements and items may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should be reviewed in conjunction with our results reported in accordance with GAAP in this Annual Report. 
 
 There are significant limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure including, but not limited to, it not reflecting the cost of cash expenditures for capital assets or certain other contractual commitments, finance lease obligation and debt service expenses, income taxes and any impacts from changes in working capital. 
 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as a consolidated measure which we reconcile by adding Net (loss) income including noncontrolling interests, less Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, plus Non-operating income and expenses, including Net periodic benefit income, excluding service cost, Interest expense, net and Other (income) expense, net, plus (Benefit) provision for income taxes and Depreciation and amortization all calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus adjustments for Share-based compensation, non-cash LIFO charge or benefit, Restructuring, acquisition and integration related expenses, Goodwill impairment charges, Loss (gain) on sale of assets and other asset charges, certain legal charges and gains, and certain other non-cash charges or other items, as determined by management.

The 53rd week in fiscal 2024 contributed an estimated 582 million to Net sales. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, Net sales were 30.4 billion, an increase of approximately 0.4 from fiscal 2023. The increase in Net sales was primarily driven by inflation and new business with existing customers. These increases were partially offset by a decline in unit volumes. 
 
 Retail Net sales decreased 44 million in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. The 53rd week in fiscal 2024 contributed an estimated 45 million to Retail Net sales. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, Retail Net sales decreased 89 million, or 3.6 , primarily due to lower volume and store closures. Identical store sales decreased 3.7 . 
 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Profit 
 
 Our Gross profit increased 70 million, or 1.7 , to 4,201 million in fiscal 2024, from 4,131 million in fiscal 2023. Gross profit increased by 82 million from the estimated impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. Our Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales was 13.6 in fiscal 2024, which was approximately flat compared to fiscal 2023. The LIFO charge was 7 million and 119 million in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. Excluding the non-cash LIFO charge, gross profit rate was 13.6 of Net sales and 14.0 of Net sales for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The remaining decrease in gross profit rate of 46 basis points was primarily driven by lower levels of procurement gains resulting from decelerating inflation and a lower retail gross profit rate, which were partially offset by the benefit of lower shrink expense. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses increased 127 million, or 3.2 , to 4,100 million, or 13.2 of Net sales, in fiscal 2024 compared to 3,973 million, or 13.1 of Net sales, in fiscal 2023. Operating expenses increased by 78 million from the estimated impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. The increase in Operating expenses as a percentage of Net sales was primarily driven by approximately 49 million higher incentive compensation expense in fiscal 2024 and incremental transformation costs, which were partially offset by lower transportation costs and other operational supply chain efficiencies.

 Restructuring, Acquisition and Integration Related Expenses 
 
 Restructuring, acquisition and integration related expenses were 36 million for fiscal 2024, compared to 8 million for fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily driven by costs associated with certain employee severance and other employee separation costs in fiscal 2024. 
 
 Loss (Gain) on Sale of Assets and Other Asset Charges 
 
 Loss on sale of assets and other asset charges increased 27 million to 57 million for fiscal 2024, from 30 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by higher asset impairment charges and losses on the sales of receivables under the accounts receivable monetization program, which was entered into early in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2024 primarily includes 43 million in asset impairment charges related to one of our corporate-owned office locations, certain leased and owned distribution centers and certain retail store locations and 21 million in losses on the sales of receivables. Fiscal 2023 primarily included a 25 million intangible asset impairment charge related to a rationalization of our brands portfolio and 14 million in losses on the sales of receivables. 
 
 Operating Income 
 
 Reflecting the factors described above, Operating income decreased 112 million to 8 million for fiscal 2024, from 120 million in fiscal 2023. The decrease in Operating income was primarily driven by an increase in Operating expenses, an increase in Restructuring, acquisition and integration related expenses and an increase in Loss on sale of assets and other asset charges, partially offset by an increase in Gross profit. 
 
 Net Periodic Benefit Income, Excluding Service Cost 
 
 Net periodic benefit income, excluding service cost decreased 14 million to 15 million in fiscal 2024, from 29 million in fiscal 2023. The decrease in Net periodic benefit income, excluding service cost was primarily driven by higher interest costs from a higher discount rate utilized in the measurement of pension liabilities and 3 million of lower income from expected returns on plan assets.

 The increase in Interest expense, net for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by higher average interest rates, an increase in losses on debt extinguishment, and an estimated 3 million impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. 
 
 (Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The effective tax rate was a benefit rate of 19.7 on a pre-tax loss for fiscal 2024 compared to a benefit rate of 328.6 on pre-tax income for fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2024, the effective tax rate was impacted by non-deductible share-based compensation and the establishment of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets with limited lives. For fiscal 2023, the effective tax rate was impacted by solar credits, including the tax credit impact of a fiscal 2023 investment in an equity method partnership and solar credits associated with a solar array installation at our Howell Township, New Jersey facility. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and excess tax deductions attributable to share-based compensation. The combined impact of these fiscal 2023 tax benefits exceeded pre-tax income, generating an overall tax benefit rate for fiscal 2023.

 Net (Loss) Income Attributable to United Natural Foods, Inc. 
 
 Reflecting the factors described in more detail above, Net loss attributable to United Natural Foods, Inc. was 112 million, or 1.89 per diluted common share, for fiscal 2024, compared to Net income attributable to United Natural Foods, Inc. of 24 million, or 0.40 per diluted common share, for fiscal 2023. 

Segment Results of Operations 
 
 In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management primarily uses Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA of its business segments as discussed and reconciled within Note 16 Business Segments in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and the above table within the Executive Overview section. The following tables set forth Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the periods indicated.

 Net Sales 
 
 Wholesale Net sales increased 152 million in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023, excluding an estimated 559 million benefit from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. The increase in Wholesale Net sales, excluding the 53rd week, was primarily driven by inflation and new business with existing customers. These increases were partially offset by a decline in unit volumes, as discussed in Results of Operations - Fiscal year ended August 3, 2024 (fiscal 2024) compared to fiscal year ended July 29, 2023 (fiscal 2023) - Net Sales section above. 
 
 Retail Net sales decreased 89 million, or 3.6 , in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023, excluding an estimated benefit of 45 million from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. The decrease in Retail Net sales, excluding the 53rd week, was primarily due to lower volume and store closures. Identical store sales decreased 3.7 . 
 
 Lower eliminations of Net sales for fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 were primarily due to a decrease in Wholesale to Retail sales, which are eliminated upon consolidation. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Wholesale Adjusted EBITDA decreased 11.9 for fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease was driven by an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit excluding the LIFO charge. Wholesale Gross profit excluding the LIFO charge for fiscal 2024 decreased 57 million, when excluding an estimated 67 million benefit from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. Wholesale gross profit rate decreased approximately 26 basis points primarily driven by lower levels of procurement gains resulting from decelerating inflation, partially offset by lower shrink expense. Wholesale Operating expense, which excludes depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and other adjustments as outlined in Note 16 Business Segments in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, increased 15 million when excluding an estimated 59 million impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. Wholesale operating expense rate was approximately flat to fiscal 2023 primarily driven by higher incentive compensation expense, offset by lower transportation costs and other operational supply chain efficiencies. Wholesale depreciation and amortization expense increased 4 million for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, when excluding an estimated 5 million in additional expense from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024.

 Retail Adjusted EBITDA decreased 88.6 for fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. Retail Gross profit excluding the LIFO charge for fiscal 2024 decreased 55 million, when excluding an estimated 11 million benefit from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. Retail gross profit rate decreased approximately 132 basis points from margin rate investments intended to drive traffic and lower sales volume. Retail Operating expense, which excludes depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and other adjustments as outlined in Note 16 Business Segments in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, increased 10 million when excluding an estimated 11 million impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. Retail operating expense rate increased 129 basis points primarily driven by decreased leverage on higher fixed and variable costs against lower sales. Retail depreciation and amortization expense decreased 2 million for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, when excluding an estimated 1 million in additional expense from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Highlights 
 
 Total liquidity as of August 3, 2024 was 1,275 million and consisted of the following: 
 1,235 million of unused credit under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility as of August 3, 2024, which decreased 245 million from 1,480 million as of July 29, 2023, primarily due to increased borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility utilized to fund voluntary prepayments on the Term Loan Facility (as described below) and payments used in investing activities, partially offset by net cash flow from operating activities and higher levels of availability under the ABL Credit Facility resulting from the First ABL Amendment (defined below); and 
 40 million of cash and cash equivalents as of August 3, 2024, which increased 3 million from 37 million as of July 29, 2023. 
 Total debt increased 122 million to 2,085 million as of August 3, 2024 from 1,963 million as of July 29, 2023, primarily related to additional net borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility to fund payments used in investing activities and for debt issuance costs, partially offset by net cash flow from operating activities. 
 Working capital decreased 21 million to 1,037 million as of August 3, 2024 from 1,058 million as of July 29, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in inventory levels and an increase in accrued compensation and benefits, which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable combined with an increase in accounts receivable. 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into an amendment to the ABL Loan Agreement (the First ABL Amendment to execute on a First In, Last Out FILO tranche of incremental loans (the ABL FILO Loan and used the 130 million in proceeds from the ABL FILO Loan and borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility to fund a 145 million voluntary prepayment on the Term Loan Facility. 
 Concurrent with the voluntary prepayment on the Term Loan Facility, we entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Agreement (the Fourth Term Loan Amendment to reduce the principal amount of the Term Loan Facility to 500 million and extend the maturity to May 1, 2031. 
 In fiscal 2025, scheduled debt maturities are expected to be 6 million. Based on the Company s Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) in fiscal 2024, no prepayment from Excess Cash Flow in fiscal 2024 is required to be made in fiscal 2025. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 We expect to continue to replenish operating assets and pay down debt obligations with internally generated funds. A significant reduction in operating earnings or the incurrence of operating losses could have a negative impact on our operating cash flow, which may limit our ability to pay down our outstanding indebtedness as planned. Our credit facilities are secured by a substantial portion of our total assets. We expect to be able to fund debt maturities and finance lease liabilities through fiscal 2025 with internally generated funds and borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are from internally generated funds and from borrowing capacity under the ABL Credit Facility. We believe our short-term and long-term financing abilities are adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to satisfy debt obligations and fund capital expenditures as opportunities arise. Our continued access to short-term and long-term financing through credit markets depends on numerous factors, including the condition of the credit markets and our results of operations, cash flows, financial position and credit ratings. 
 
 Primary uses of cash include debt service, capital expenditures, working capital maintenance, investments in cloud technologies and income tax payments. We typically finance working capital needs with cash provided from operating activities and short-term borrowings. Inventories are managed primarily through demand forecasting and replenishing depleted inventories.

 We currently do not pay a dividend on our common stock. In addition, we are limited in the aggregate amount of dividends that we may pay under the terms of our Term Loan Facility, ABL Credit Facility and our 500 million of unsecured 6.750 senior notes due October 15, 2028 (the Senior Notes ). Subject to certain limitations contained in our debt agreements and as market conditions warrant, we may from time to time refinance indebtedness that we have incurred, including through the incurrence or repayment of loans under existing or new credit facilities or the issuance or repayment of debt securities. Proceeds from the sale of any properties mortgaged and encumbered under our Term Loan Facility are required to be used to make additional Term Loan Facility payments or to be reinvested in the business. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 
 During fiscal 2024, we borrowed a net 301 million under the ABL Credit Facility, including 130 million from the creation of the FILO tranche of incremental loans described above, and made voluntary prepayments on the Term Loan Facility totaling 171 million. Refer to Note 9 Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for a detailed discussion of the provisions of our credit facilities and certain long-term debt agreements and additional information. 
 
 Our Term Loan Agreement and Senior Notes do not include any financial maintenance covenants. Our ABL Loan Agreement subjects us to a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0 calculated at the end of each of our fiscal quarters on a rolling four quarter basis, if the adjusted aggregate availability is ever less than the greater of (i) 220 million, or 210 million if no ABL FILO Loans are then outstanding at such time and (ii) 10 of the aggregate borrowing base. We have not been subject to the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the ABL Loan Agreement, including through the filing date of this Annual Report. The Term Loan Agreement, Senior Notes and ABL Loan Agreement contain certain operational and informational covenants customary for debt securities of these types that limit our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur debt, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders, transfer or sell assets, create liens on our assets, engage in transactions with affiliates, and merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets on a consolidated basis. We were in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, we may be in default under the applicable debt agreement, and all amounts due thereunder may become immediately due and payable. 
 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into an amendment to the ABL Loan Agreement to execute on a FILO tranche of incremental loans under the ABL Loan Agreement. The First ABL Amendment provides for the creation of a FILO tranche of 130 million with an applicable margin equal to Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 2.50 per annum (or a base rate plus 1.50 per annum). The ABL FILO Loan is subject to a borrowing base consisting of specified percentages of the value of eligible accounts receivable, credit card receivables, inventory, pharmacy receivables and pharmacy prescription files. Also in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into the Fourth Term Loan Amendment, which provides for the reduction of the principal amount of the Term Loan Facility to 500 million, the extension of the maturity to May 1, 2031, subject to certain springing maturity conditions, and a change in the applicable margin over a base rate from 2.25 to 3.75 per annum, or over a SOFR rate from 3.25 to 4.75 per annum. In conjunction with the First ABL Amendment and the Fourth Term Loan Amendment, we made a voluntary prepayment of 145 million on the Term Loan Facility funded with the 130 million of ABL FILO Loan proceeds and incremental borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. Refer to Note 9 Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 
 Refer to Note 9 Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further detail of our scheduled debt maturities by fiscal year and by debt instrument, which excludes debt prepayments that may be required from Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) generated or sales of mortgaged properties in fiscal 2025 or beyond. Based on our Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) in fiscal 2024, no prepayment from Excess Cash Flow in fiscal 2024 is required to be made in fiscal 2025. 
 
 Derivatives and Hedging Activity 
 
 We enter into interest rate swap contracts from time to time to mitigate our exposure to changes in market interest rates as part of our strategy to manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of notional debt amounts subject to fixed and floating interest rates. Interest rate swap contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures.

Table of Contents 

 As of August 3, 2024, we had an aggregate of 750 million of floating rate notional debt subject to active interest rate swap contracts, which effectively fix the SOFR component of our floating interest payments through pay fixed and receive floating interest rate swap agreements. These fixed rates range from 2.403 to 4.130 , with maturities between October 2024 and June 2028. The fair values of these interest rate derivatives represent a total net asset of 0 million as of August 3, 2024, and are subject to volatility based on changes in market interest rates. Refer to Note 8 Derivatives in Part II, Item 8 and Interest Rate Risk in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 
 From time-to-time, we enter into fixed price fuel supply agreements and foreign currency hedges . As of August 3, 2024, we had fixed price fuel contracts and foreign currency forward agreements outstanding. Gains and losses and the outstanding assets and liabilities from these arrangements are insignificant. 
 
 Payments for Capital Expenditures and Cloud Technology Implementation Expenditures 
 
 Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 were 345 million compared to 323 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of 22 million. Our capital spending for fiscal 2024 and 2023 principally included supply chain and information technology expenditures, including investments in growth initiatives and maintenance expenditures. Fiscal 2024 included 281 million of distribution center improvements, technology and other expenditures, 41 million of investments in new distribution centers, primarily the new Manchester, Pennsylvania distribution center, and 23 million of Retail expenditures. Fiscal 2023 included 290 million of distribution center improvements, technology and other expenditures, and 33 million of Retail expenditures. Cloud technology implementation expenditures, which are included in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were 25 million for fiscal 2024 compared to 21 million for fiscal 2023. 
 
 Fiscal 2025 capital and cloud implementation spending is expected to be approximately 300 million and includes projects that automate, optimize and expand our distribution network, as well as our technology platform investments. The components of capital and cloud implementation expenditures for fiscal 2025 will be primarily dependent on the nature of certain contracts to be executed. We expect to finance fiscal 2025 capital and cloud implementation expenditures requirements with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. Future investments may be financed through long-term debt or borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility and cash from operations.

 Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023 
 
 The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower levels of cash generated by net working capital, including lower proceeds received from the monetization of certain receivables compared to fiscal 2023 and higher receivables levels from sales growth in fiscal 2024. These decreases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by higher levels of accrued incentive compensation net of related payments and lower inventory levels net of related payables in fiscal 2024. In addition, lower cash was generated from net income in fiscal 2024. 
 
 The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increased payments for capital expenditures in fiscal 2024. 
 
 The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in net borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility resulting from decreases in net cash provided by operating activities, increases in net cash used in investing activities and the creation of the FILO tranche of incremental loans discussed above, and a decrease in cash used to repurchase common stock.

Other Obligations and Commitments 
 
 Our principal contractual obligations and commitments consist of obligations under our long-term debt, interest on long-term debt, operating and finance leases, purchase obligations, self-insurance liabilities and multiemployer plan withdrawal liabilities. 
 
 Refer to Note 9 Long-Term Debt, Note 11 Leases, Note 13 Benefit Plans, Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17 Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on the nature and timing of obligations for debt, leases, benefit plans, self-insurance and purchase obligations, respectively. The future amount and timing of interest expense payments are expected to vary with the amount and then prevailing contractual interest rates over our debt as discussed in Interest Rate Risk in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report. 
 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations 
 
 We contributed 1 million and 1 million to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively, in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, no minimum pension contributions are required to be made to the SUPERVALU INC. Retirement Plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ). An insignificant amount of contributions are expected to be made to defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2025. We fund our defined benefit pension plan based on the minimum contribution required under ERISA, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and other applicable laws and additional contributions made at our discretion. We may accelerate contributions or undertake contributions in excess of the minimum requirements from time to time subject to the availability of cash in excess of operating and financing needs or other factors as may be applicable. We assess the relative attractiveness of the use of cash to accelerate contributions considering such factors as expected return on assets, discount rates, cost of debt, reducing or eliminating required Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation variable rate premiums or in order to achieve exemption from participant notices of underfunding. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Multiemployer Pension Arrangements 
 
 We contribute to various multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements, primarily defined benefit pension plans. These multiemployer plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Plan trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as the investment of the assets and plan administration. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions that are parties to the relevant collective bargaining agreements. Based on the assessment of the most recent information available from the multiemployer plans, we believe that most of the plans to which we contribute are underfunded. We are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans and the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability to us. 
 
 Our contributions can fluctuate from year to year due to store closures, employer participation within the respective plans and reductions in headcount. Our contributions to these plans could increase in the near term. However, the amount of any increase or decrease in contributions will depend on a variety of factors, including the results of our collective bargaining efforts, investment returns on the assets held in the plans, actions taken by the trustees who manage the plans and requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act and Section 412(e) of the Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore, if we were to significantly reduce contributions, exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans, we could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal that could require us to record a withdrawal liability obligation and make withdrawal liability payments to the fund. Expense is recognized in connection with these plans as contributions are funded, in accordance with GAAP. We made contributions to these plans, and recognized expense of 47 million, 48 million and 45 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In fiscal 2025, we expect to contribute approximately 51 million to multiemployer plans, subject to the outcome of collective bargaining and capital market conditions. We expect required cash payments to fund multiemployer pension plans from which we have withdrawn to be insignificant in any one fiscal year, which would exclude any payments that may be agreed to on a lump sum basis to satisfy existing withdrawal liabilities. Any future withdrawal liability would be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with GAAP. Any triggered withdrawal obligation could result in a material charge and payment obligations that would be required to be made over an extended period of time. 
 
 We also make contributions to multiemployer health and welfare plans in amounts set forth in the related collective bargaining agreements. A small minority of collective bargaining agreements contain reserve requirements that may trigger unanticipated contributions resulting in increased healthcare expenses. If these healthcare provisions cannot be renegotiated in a manner that reduces the prospective healthcare cost as we intend, our Operating expenses could increase in the future.

 Share Repurchases 
 
 In September 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to 200 million of our common stock over a term of four years (the 2022 Repurchase Program ). Under the 2022 Repurchase Program, we repurchased approximately 1,888,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of 62 million in fiscal 2023. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in fiscal 2024. As of August 3, 2024, we had 138 million remaining authorized under the 2022 Repurchase Program. 
 
 We will manage the timing of any repurchases of our common stock in response to market conditions and other relevant factors, including any limitations on our ability to make repurchases under the terms of our ABL Credit Facility, Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes. We may implement the 2022 Repurchase Program pursuant to a plan or plans meeting the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management believes the following critical accounting estimates reflect our more subjective or complex judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Inventories 
 
 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Substantially all of our inventories consist of finished goods. Inventories are recorded net of vendor allowances and cash discounts. We evaluate inventory shortages (shrink) throughout each fiscal year based on physical counts in our facilities. The majority of our inventory is valued under the LIFO method, which allows for matching of costs and revenues, as the current acquisition cost is used to value cost of goods sold as inventory is sold in an inflationary environment. During fiscal 2024, inventory quantities in certain LIFO layers were reduced. These reductions resulted in a liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of fiscal 2024 purchases, the effect of which decreased Cost of sales by approximately 15 million in fiscal 2024. If the first-in, first-out FIFO method had been used, Inventories, net, would have been higher by approximately 351 million and 344 million at August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. As of August 3, 2024, approximately 1.9 billion or 82 of inventory was valued under the LIFO method, before the application of any LIFO reserve, and primarily included grocery, frozen food and general merchandise products, with the remaining inventory valued under the first-in, first-out method and primarily included meat, dairy and deli products. When holding inventory levels and mix constant, as of August 3, 2024, we estimate a 50 basis point increase in the inflation rate on our ending LIFO-based inventory would result in an 8 million increase in the LIFO charge on an annualized basis. 
 
 Vendor funds 
 
 We receive funds from many of the vendors whose products we buy for resale. These vendor funds are generally provided to increase the purchasing and sell-through of the related products. We receive vendor funds for a variety of merchandising activities: placement of the vendors products in our advertising; display of the vendors products in prominent locations in our stores; support for the introduction of new products into our stores and distribution centers; exclusivity rights in certain categories; and compensation for temporary price reductions offered on products held for sale. We also receive vendor funds for buying activities such as volume commitment rebates, credits for purchasing products in advance of their need and cash discounts for the early payment of merchandise purchases. The majority of our vendor fund contracts have terms of less than a year, although some of the contracts have terms of longer than one year. 
 
 We recognize vendor funds for merchandising activities as a reduction of Cost of sales when the related products are sold, unless it has been determined that a discrete identifiable benefit has been provided to the vendor, in which case the related amounts are recognized within Net sales and represent less than 0.5 of total Net sales. Vendor funds that have been earned as a result of completing the required performance under the terms of the underlying agreements but for which the product has not yet been sold are recognized as reductions to the value of on-hand inventory.

Table of Contents 

 The amount and timing of recognition of vendor funds as well as the amount of vendor funds to be recognized as a reduction to ending inventory requires management judgment and estimates. Management determines these amounts based on estimates of current year purchase volume using forecast and historical data and a review of average inventory turnover data. These judgments and estimates impact our reported Gross profit, Operating income and inventory amounts. The historical estimates have been reliable in the past, and we believe our methodology will continue to be reliable in the future. Based on previous experience, we do not expect significant changes in the level of vendor support. However, if such changes were to occur, Cost of sales and Net sales could change, depending on the specific vendors involved. If vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated, we would consider changing the volume, type and frequency of the advertising, which could increase or decrease our advertising exp ense. 
 
 Benefit plans 
 
 We sponsor pension and other postretirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements. Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based on each participant s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Our defined benefit pension plan and certain supplemental executive retirement plans are closed to new participants and service crediting ended for all participants. 
 
 While we believe the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. 
 
 The determination of our obligation and related expense for Company-sponsored pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent, in part, on management s selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include, among other things, the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We measure our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan obligations as of the nearest calendar month end. Refer to Note 13 Benefit Plans in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for information related to the actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement healthcare liabilities and expenses. 
 
 Discount rates 
 
 We review and select the discount rate to be used in connection with our pension and other postretirement obligations annually. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. We set our rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. 
 
 We utilize the full yield curve approach for determining the interest and service cost components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Under this method, the discount rate assumption used in the interest and service cost components of net periodic benefit cost is built through applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation described above, to the relevant projected future cash flows of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We believe the full yield curve approach reflects a greater correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and provides a more precise measurement of interest and service costs. Each 25-basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase our projected pension benefit obligation by 36 million, as of August 3, 2024, and for fiscal 2024 would increase Net periodic benefit income by approximately 2 million. 
 
 Expected rate of return on plan assets 
 
 Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined based on the portfolio s actual and target composition, current market conditions, forward-looking return and risk assumptions by asset class, and historical long-term investment performance. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension assets was 6.25 for fiscal 2024. The 10-year rolling average annualized return for the SUPERVALU INC. Retirement Plan is approximately 7.6 based on returns from 2015 to 2024. Each 25-basis point reduction in expected return on plan assets would decrease Net periodic benefit income for fiscal 2024 by approximately 4 million.

Table of Contents 

 Amortizing gains and losses 
 
 In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense and obligations in future periods. We recognize the amortization of net actuarial loss on the SUPERVALU INC. Retirement Plan over the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants based on our determination that almost all of the defined benefit pension plan participants are inactive and the plan is frozen to new participants. For the purposes of inactive participants, we utilized a 90 threshold established under our policy. 
 
 Multiemployer pension plans 
 
 We contribute to various multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements. These multiemployer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Plan trustees are typically responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans. 
 
 We continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are or were beneficiaries of these plans. In the future, we may consider opportunities to limit the Company s exposure to underfunded multiemployer pension obligations by moving our active associates in such plans to defined contribution plans, and withdrawing from the pension plan or continuing to participate in the plans for prior obligations. As we continue to work to find solutions to underfunded multiemployer pension plans, it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain additional multiemployer pension plan obligations in the future as we actively negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with a number of our unions in due course. 
 
 The American Rescue Plan Act ARPA established the Special Financial Assistance SFA Program for financially troubled multiemployer pension plans. Under ARPA, eligible multiemployer pension plans can apply to receive a cash payment intended to keep the plan solvent and able to pay pension benefits through the plan year ending 2051. As of the end of fiscal 2024, one plan to which the Company contributes has received SFA, and two other plans to which the Company contributes are currently on the waiting list to apply for SFA funding. Although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours, addressing these uncertainties requires judgment in the timing of expense recognition when we determine our commitment is probable and estimable. 
 
 Refer to Note 13 Benefit Plans in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information relating to our participation in these multiemployer pension plans and to the actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and other postretirement liabilities and expenses. 
 
 Self-insurance liabilities 
 
 We are primarily self-insured for workers compensation, general and automobile liability insurance. It is our policy to record the self-insured portions of our workers compensation, general and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods of estimating the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled, and that have been incurred but not yet reported. Any projection of losses concerning these liabilities is subject to a considerable degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. If actual claims incurred are greater than those anticipated, our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accruals for workers compensation, general and automobile liabilities totaled 89 million and 97 million as of August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Recoverability of long-lived assets 
 
 We review long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets at least annually, and on an interim basis if events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate these assets at the asset-group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections. When the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover an asset s carrying amount, the fair value is compared to the carrying value to determine the loss to be recorded. 
 
 Estimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgments based on the Company s experience and knowledge of operations. These estimates project cash flows several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as changes in supply contracts, macroeconomic impacts and market competition.

Table of Contents 

As part of our quarterly procedures and annual impairment assessment, we recognized a 21 million non-cash asset impairment charge related to one of our corporate-owned office locations in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, a 7 million non-cash asset impairment charge related to the decision to close certain retail store locations in the third quarter of 2024 and a 15 million non-cash impairment charge related to the decision to close certain leased and owned distribution center locations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Income taxes 
 
 The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized within the provision for income tax in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 
 The calculation of the Company s tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations and is based on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Addressing these uncertainties requires judgment and estimates; however, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be affected based on favorable or unfavorable tax settlements. Unfavorable tax settlements will generally require the use of cash and may result in an increase to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Favorable tax settlements may be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. 
 
 The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. In making this evaluation, the Company considers the statutory recovery periods for the assets, along with available sources of future taxable income, including reversals of existing and future taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, history of taxable income and projections of future income. The Company gives more significance to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the existence of deferred tax liabilities that are forecast to generate taxable income within the relevant carryover periods and a history of earnings. A valuation allowance is provided when the Company concludes, based on all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized during the applicable recovery period.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to a number of market related risks, including changes in interest rates, fuel prices, foreign exchange rates and changes in the market price of investments held in our master trust used to fund defined benefit pension obligations. We have historically employed financial derivative instruments from time to time to reduce these risks. We do not use financial instruments or derivatives for any trading or other speculative purposes. We currently utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce the market risks related to changes in interest rates, fuel prices and foreign exchange rates. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market pricing risk consisting of interest rate risk related to certain of our debt instruments and notes receivable outstanding. Our debt obligations are more fully described in Note 9 Long-Term Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Interest rate risk is managed through the strategic use of fixed and variable rate debt and derivative instruments. As more fully described in Note 8 Derivatives in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, we have used interest rate swap agreements to mitigate our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by effectively converting certain of our variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations. These interest rate swaps are derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the forecasted interest payments related to a certain portion of our debt obligations. Our variable rate borrowings consist primarily of SOFR-based loans, which is the benchmark interest rate being hedged in our interest rate swap agreements. 
 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 Changes in interest rates could also affect the interest rates we pay on future borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility, which rates are typically related to SOFR. As of August 3, 2024, we estimate that a 100-basis point increase in the interest rates related to our variable rate borrowings would increase our annualized interest expense by approximately 9 million, net of the floating interest rate receivable on our interest rate swaps. Changes in interest rates related to our fixed rate debt instruments would not have an impact upon future results of operations or cash flows while outstanding; however, if additional debt issuances at higher interest rates are required to fund fixed rate debt maturities, future results of operations or cash flows may be impacted. 
 
 As of August 3, 2024, a 100-basis point increase in forward SOFR interest rates would increase the fair value of the interest rate swaps by approximately 11 million; while a 100-basis point decrease in forward SOFR interest rates would decrease the fair value of the interest rate swaps by approximately 11 million. Refer to Note 8 Derivatives in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information on interest rate swap contracts. 
 
 The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including debt obligations and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents principal amounts due and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates using interest rates as of August 3, 2024, excluding any original issue and purchase accounting discounts and deferred financing costs.

 Investment Risk 
 
 The SUPERVALU INC. Retirement Plan holds investments in fixed income securities, domestic equity securities, private equity securities, international equity securities and real estate securities, which is described further in Note 13 Benefit Plans in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Changes in SUPERVALU INC. Retirement Plan assets can affect the amount of our anticipated future contributions. In addition, increases or decreases in SUPERVALU INC. Retirement Plan assets can result in a related increase or decrease to our equity through Accumulated other comprehensive loss. In fiscal 2022, as the plan administrator, we took additional steps to de-risk the investments in the plan assets as its funding level increased. This de-risking included a further shift to fixed income investments. Given the relationships between discount rates that impact the valuation of fixed income plan assets and the impact of discount rates in measuring plan obligations, the SUPERVALU INC. Retirement Plan is subject to less volatility in the net plan assets. As of August 3, 2024, a 10 unfavorable change in the total value of investments held by the SUPERVALU INC. Retirement Plan (entirely within the return-seeking portion of the plan assets) would not have had an impact on our minimum contributions required under ERISA for fiscal 2024, but would have resulted in an unfavorable change in net periodic pension income for fiscal 2025 of 2 million and would have reduced Stockholders equity by 153 million on a pre-tax basis as of August 3, 2024. 
 
 Fuel Price and Foreign Exchange Risk 
 
 To reduce diesel price risk, we have entered into derivative financial instruments and/or forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements at fixed prices primarily related to inbound transportation. To reduce foreign exchange risk, we have entered into derivative financial instruments for a portion of our projected monthly foreign currency requirements at fixed prices. The fair values of fuel derivative and foreign exchange agreements are measured using Level 2 inputs. As of August 3, 2024, the fair value and expected exposure risk based on aggregate notional values are insignificant.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 United Natural Foods, Inc.: 
 Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Natural Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended August 3, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of August 3, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended August 3, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 3, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Assessment of the value of the defined benefit pension obligation 
 
 As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan, covering employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. The value of the defined benefit pension obligation at year end was 1.50 billion, offset by plan assets totaling 1.53 billion. The determination of the Company s defined benefit pension obligation with respect to the plan is dependent, in part, on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate used. 
 We identified the assessment of the value of the defined benefit pension obligation as a critical audit matter because of the subjectivity in evaluating the discount rate used, and the impact small changes in this assumption would have on the measurement of the defined benefit pension obligation. Additionally, the audit effort associated with the evaluation of the discount rate required specialized skills and knowledge. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s defined benefit pension obligation process, including a control related to the development of the discount rate used. We compared the methodology used in the current year to develop the discount rate to the methodology used in the prior period. In addition, we involved an actuarial professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in the evaluation of the Company s discount rate by evaluating the methodology utilized by the Company and assessing the selected discount rate against publicly available discount rate benchmark information.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 1993.

Customer incentives 
 
 The Company provides incentives to its wholesale customers in various forms established under the applicable agreement, including advances, payments over time that are earned by achieving specified purchasing thresholds, and upon the passage of time. The Company typically records customer advances within Other long-term assets and Prepaid expenses and other current assets and typically recognizes customer incentive payments that are based on expected purchases over the term of the agreement as a reduction to Net sales. To the extent that the transaction price for product sales includes variable consideration, such as certain of these customer incentives, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price primarily by utilizing the expected value method. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the agreement will not occur. The Company believes that there will not be significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration, as the uncertainty will be resolved within a relatively short time and there is a significant amount of historical data that is used in the estimation of the amount of variable consideration to be received. Therefore, the Company has not constrained its estimates of variable consideration. 
 
 Customer incentive assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances exist for which the Company no longer expects to recover the applicable customer incentives. 
 
 Professional services and equipment sales 
 
 Separate from the services provided in conjunction with the sale of products described above, many of the Company s agreements with customers also include distinct professional services and other promises to customers, in addition to the sale of the product itself, such as retail store support, advertising, store layout and design services, merchandising support, couponing, eCommerce, network and data hosting solutions, training and certifications classes, and administrative back-office solutions. These professional services may contain a single performance obligation for each respective service, in which case such services revenues are recognized when delivered. Revenues from professional services are less than of total Net sales.

 The Company serves customers in the United States and Canada, as well as customers located in other countries. However, all of the Company s revenue is earned in the United States and Canada, and international distribution occurs through freight-forwarders. The Company does not have any performance obligations on international shipments subsequent to delivery to the domestic port. 
 
 Contract Balances 
 
 The Company typically does not incur costs that are required to be capitalized in connection with obtaining a contract with a customer. The Company typically does not have any performance obligations to deliver products under its contracts until its customers submit a purchase order, as it stands ready to deliver product upon receipt of a purchase order under contracts with its customers. These performance obligations are generally satisfied within a very short period of time. Therefore, the Company has utilized the practical expedient that provides an exemption from disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less. The Company does not typically receive pre-payments from its customers. 
 
 Customer payments are due when control of goods or services are transferred to the customer and are typically not conditional on anything other than payment terms, which typically are less than 30 days. Since no significant financing components exist between the period of time the Company transfers goods or services to the customer and when it receives payment for those goods or services, the Company generally does not adjust the transaction price to recognize a financing component. Customer incentives are not considered contract assets as they are not generated through the transfer of goods or services to the customers. No material contract asset or liability exists for any period reported within these Consolidated Financial Statements.

of the union employees participate in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under collective bargaining agreements. The remaining either participate in plans sponsored by the Company or are not currently eligible to participate in a retirement plan. In addition to sponsoring both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, the Company provides healthcare and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees under postretirement benefit plans. The Company also provides certain health and welfare benefits, including short-term and long-term disability benefits, to inactive disabled employees prior to retirement. The terms of the postretirement benefit plans vary based on employment history, age and date of retirement. For many retirees, the Company provides a fixed dollar contribution and retirees pay contributions to fund the remaining cost.

 (1) Expected return on plan assets is estimated by utilizing forward-looking, long-term return, risk and correlation assumptions developed and updated annually by the Company. These assumptions are weighted by the actual or target allocation to each underlying asset class represented in the pension plan master trust. The Company also assesses the expected long-term return on plan assets assumption by comparison to long-term historical performance on an asset class basis to ensure the assumption is reasonable. Long-term trends are also evaluated relative to market factors such as inflation, interest rates, and fiscal and monetary policies in order to assess the capital market assumptions. 
 
 The Company reviews and selects the discount rate to be used in connection with measuring its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations annually. In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on corporate bonds (rated AA or better) that coincides with the cash flows of the plans estimated benefit payouts. The model uses a yield curve approach to discount each cash flow of the liability stream at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow. The model totals the present values of all cash flows and calculates the equivalent weighted average discount rate by imputing the singular interest rate that equates the total present value with the stream of future cash flows. This resulting weighted average discount rate is then used in evaluating the final discount rate to be used. 
 
 For those retirees whose health plans provide for variable employer contributions, the assumed healthcare cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation before age 65 was as of August 3, 2024. The assumed healthcare cost trend rate for retirees before age 65 will decrease each year through fiscal 2034, until it reaches the ultimate trend rate of . For those retirees whose health plans provide for variable employer contributions, the assumed healthcare cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation after age 65 was as of August 3, 2024. 
 
 Pension Plan Assets 
 
 Pension plan assets are held in a master trust and invested in separately managed accounts and other commingled investment vehicles holding fixed income securities, domestic equity securities, private equity securities, international equity securities and real estate securities. The Company employs a liability hedging approach, targeting a level of risk commensurate with keeping pace with the long-term cost of funding plan liabilities. Risk is managed through diversification across asset classes, multiple investment manager portfolios and both general and portfolio-specific investment guidelines. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded status and the Company s financial condition. This asset allocation policy mix is reviewed annually and actual versus target allocations are monitored regularly and rebalanced on an as-needed basis. Plan assets are invested using a combination of active and passive investment strategies. Passive, or indexed strategies, attempt to mimic rather than exceed the investment performance of a market benchmark. The plan s active investment strategies employ multiple investment management firms. Managers within each asset class cover a range of investment styles and approaches and are combined in a way that controls for capitalization, and style biases (equities) and interest rate exposures (fixed income) versus benchmark indices. Monitoring activities to evaluate performance against targets and measure investment risk take place on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

 Domestic equity Private equity International equity Real estate Total 
 
 The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value: 
 
 Common stock - Valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. 
 
 Common collective trusts - Investments in common/collective trust funds are stated at net asset value NAV as determined by the issuer of the common/collective trust funds and is based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund less its liabilities. The majority of the common/collective trust funds have a readily determinable fair value and are classified as Level 2. Other investments in common/collective trust funds determine NAV on a less frequent basis and/or have redemption restrictions. For these investments, NAV is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. 
 
 Corporate bonds - Valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. When quoted prices are not available for identical or similar bonds, the fair value is based upon an industry valuation model, which maximizes observable inputs. 
 
 Government securities - Certain government securities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the security is traded. Other government securities are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. 
 
 Mortgage backed securities - Valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. When quoted prices are not available for identical or similar securities, the fair value is based upon an industry valuation model, which maximizes observable inputs. 
 
 Private equity and real estate partnerships - Valued based on NAV provided by the investment manager, updated for any subsequent partnership interests cash flows or expected changes in fair value. The NAV is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. 
 
 Other - Consists primarily of options, futures, and money market investments priced at 1 per unit. 
 
 The valuation methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement.

 Contributions 
 
 No minimum pension contributions were required to be made under the SUPERVALU INC. Retirement Plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ERISA in fiscal 2024. The Company expects to contribute approximately million to its other defined benefit pension plans and million to its postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2025. 
 
 The Company funds its defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum contribution required under the Internal Revenue Code, ERISA, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and other applicable laws, as determined by our external actuarial consultant, and additional contributions made at its discretion. The Company may accelerate contributions or undertake contributions in excess of the minimum requirements from time to time subject to the availability of cash in excess of operating and financing needs or other factors as may be applicable. The Company assesses the relative attractiveness of the use of cash including such factors as expected return on assets, discount rates, cost of debt, reducing or eliminating required Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation variable rate premiums or the ability to achieve exemption from participant notices of underfunding.

 Defined Contribution Plan 
 
 The Company sponsors a defined contribution and profit sharing plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees may contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to the plan on a pre-tax or after-tax Roth basis. The Company matches a portion of certain employee contributions by contributing cash into the investment options selected by the employees. The total amount contributed by the Company to the plan is determined by plan provisions or at the Company s discretion. Total employer contribution expenses for this plan were million, million and million for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 Post-Employment Benefits 
 
 The Company recognizes an obligation for benefits provided to former or inactive employees. The Company is self-insured for certain disability plan programs, which comprise the primary benefits paid to inactive employees prior to retirement. 
 
 As of August 3, 2024 there was million of Accrued compensation and benefits and million of Other long-term liabilities recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of July 29, 2023 there was million of Accrued compensation and benefits and million of Other long-term liabilities. 
 
 Multiemployer Pension Plans 
 
 The Company contributes to various multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements, primarily defined benefit pension plans. These multiemployer plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Plan trustees are typically responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as the investment of the assets and plan administration. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and the unions that are parties to the relevant collective bargaining agreements. 
 
 Expense is recognized in connection with these plans as contributions are funded, in accordance with GAAP. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from the risks associated with single-employer plans in the following respects: 
 
 Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer are held in trust and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. 
 If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. 
 If the Company chose to stop participating in some multiemployer plans, or make market exits or closures or otherwise have participation in the plan drop below certain levels, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.

 funded and are projected to become insolvent within to years, red zone status plans are generally less than funded and are considered in critical status, yellow zone status plans are less than funded and are considered in endangered or seriously endangered status, and green zone plans are at least funded. The FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented column indicates plans for which a funding improvement plan FIP or a rehabilitation plan RP is either pending or has been implemented by the trustees of each plan. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 ARPA established the Special Financial Assistance SFA Program to permit financially troubled multiemployer plans to apply for a cash payment intended to keep plans solvent and able to pay benefits through 2051. As of August 3, 2024, one plan in which the Company participates has applied for and received SFA, and two other plans in which the Company participates are on the waiting list to apply for SFA funding. 
 
 Certain plans have been aggregated in the All Other Multiemployer Pension Plans line in the following table, as the contributions to each of these plans are not individually material. None of our collective bargaining agreements require that a minimum contribution be made to these plans. 
 
 At the date the financial statements were issued, Form 5500 for these plans were generally not available for the plan years ending in 2023.

 Multiemployer Benefit Plans Other than Pensions 
 
 The Company also makes contributions to multiemployer health and welfare plans in amounts set forth in the related collective bargaining agreements. These plans provide medical, dental, pharmacy, vision and other ancillary benefits to active employees and retirees as determined by the trustees of each plan. The vast majority of the Company s contributions benefit active employees and as such, may not constitute contributions to a postretirement benefit plan. However, the Company is unable to separate contribution amounts to postretirement benefit plans from contribution amounts paid to benefit active employees. 
 
 The Company contributed million, million and million in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, to multiemployer health and welfare plans. If healthcare provisions within these plans cannot be renegotiated in a manner that reduces the prospective healthcare cost as we intend, our Operating expenses could increase in the future.

 The Company is currently under examination in several taxing jurisdictions and remains subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for the respective taxing jurisdiction or an agreement is reached between the taxing jurisdiction and the Company. As of August 3, 2024, the Company is no longer subject to federal income tax examinations for fiscal years before 2016 and in most states is no longer subject to state income tax examinations for fiscal years before 2016 for Supervalu and the Company. Due to the implementation of the CARES Act, NOLs were carried back into fiscal years 2014 and 2015, which extends the federal statute of limitations on those years up to the amount of the carryback claim.

 million. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. In making this evaluation, the Company considers the statutory recovery periods for the assets, along with available sources of future taxable income, including reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, history of taxable income, and projections of future income. The Company gives more significance to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the existence of deferred tax liabilities that are forecast to generate taxable income within the relevant carryover periods, and a history of earnings. A valuation allowance is provided when the Company concludes, based on all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized during the applicable recovery period. The Company has reviewed these factors in evaluating the recoverability of its deferred tax assets. As of August 3, 2024, the Company anticipates sufficient future taxable income to realize all of its deferred tax assets within the applicable recovery periods with the exception of certain foreign tax credits, charitable contribution carryovers and state net operating losses. Accordingly, the Company has established valuation allowances against that portion of its charitable contribution carryovers, state net operating losses and foreign tax credits that, in the Company s judgment, are not likely to be realized within the applicable recovery periods. 
 
 At August 3, 2024, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes that are subject to an annual limitation of approximately million under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. These Section 382-limited carryforwards expire at various times through fiscal year 2027. As of August 3, 2024, the Company anticipates sufficient future taxable income over the periods in which the net operating losses can be utilized. The Company also has the availability of future reversals of taxable temporary differences that are expected to generate taxable income in the future. Therefore, the ultimate realization of net operating losses for federal purposes appears more likely than not at August 3, 2024 and correspondingly no valuation allowance has been established. 
 
 At August 3, 2024, the Company had disallowed charitable contribution carryforwards of approximately million that are available for carryforward over five years. As of August 3, 2024, the Company anticipates sufficient future taxable income to utilize million of these charitable contribution carryovers within the applicable five-year carryforward periods. The Company has established a valuation allowance against the million of charitable contribution carryovers that, in the Company s judgement, are not likely to be realized within the applicable recovery period. 
 
 The retained earnings of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiary were subject to deemed U.S. repatriation and taxation during fiscal 2017 pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and existing foreign tax credits were utilized to offset the resulting liability. We have established a deferred tax asset for the remaining U.S. foreign tax credits of million. Such credits are offset by a valuation allowance. 
 
 Effective Tax Rate 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate was a benefit rate of on pre-tax loss for fiscal 2024 as compared to benefit rate of and an expense rate of on pre-tax income for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. For fiscal 2022, the effective tax rate was reduced by the impact of discrete tax benefits related to employee stock awards and the release of unrecognized tax positions, partially offset by non-deductible executive compensation. For fiscal 2023, the effective tax rate was impacted by solar credits, including the tax credit impact of a fiscal 2023 investment in an equity method partnership and solar credits associated with a solar array installation at the Company s Howell Township, New Jersey facility. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and excess tax deductions attributable to share-based compensation. The combined impact of these fiscal 2023 tax benefits exceeded pre-tax income, generating an overall tax benefit rate for fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2024, the effective tax rate was impacted by non-deductible share-based compensation and the establishment of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets with limited lives.

reportable segments: Wholesale and Retail. These reportable segments are distinct businesses, each with a different customer base, marketing strategy and management structure. The Company organizes and operates the Wholesale reportable segment through U.S geographic regions: East, Central and West, and Canada Wholesale, which is operated separately from the U.S. Wholesale business. The U.S. Wholesale and Canada Wholesale operating segments have similar products and services, customer channels, distribution methods and economic characteristics, and therefore have been aggregated into a single reportable segment. Reportable segments are reviewed on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a change in reportable segments has occurred. 
 
 The Wholesale reportable segment is engaged in the distribution of grocery and non-food products, and provides support services to retailers in the United States and Canada. The Retail reportable segment derives revenues from the sale of groceries and other products at retail locations operated by the Company. The Company has additional operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments and are therefore aggregated under the caption of Other. Other includes a single location food manufacturing business, which engages in the importing, roasting, packaging and distributing of nuts, dried fruit, seeds, trail mixes, granola, natural and organic snack items and confections, and the Company s natural branded product lines, primarily Blue Marble Brands. Other also includes certain corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to operating segments, which include, among other expenses, restructuring, acquisition and integration related expenses, share-based compensation, and salaries, retainers, and other related expenses of certain officers and all directors. Wholesale records revenues related to sales to Retail at gross margin rates consistent with sales to other similar wholesale customers. 
 
 Segment earnings include revenues and costs attributable to each of the respective business segments and certain allocated corporate overhead, based on the segment s estimated consumption of corporately managed resources. The Company s measure of segment profit is Adjusted EBITDA, as disclosed below. The Company allocates certain corporate capital expenditures and identifiable assets to its business segments and retains certain depreciation expense related to those assets within Other. Non-operating expenses that are not allocated to the operating segments are included in the Other segment.

For each guarantee issued, if the wholesale customer or other third-party defaults on a payment, the Company would be required to make payments under its guarantee. Generally, the guarantees are secured by indemnification agreements or personal guarantees. The Company reviews performance risk related to its guarantee obligations based on internal measures of credit performance. As of August 3, 2024, the maximum amount of undiscounted payments the Company would be required to make in the event of default of all guarantees was million million on a discounted basis). Based on the indemnification agreements, personal guarantees and results of the reviews of performance risk, as of August 3, 2024, a total estimated loss of less than million is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 The Company is a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters in the ordinary course of business, which indemnities may be secured by operation of law or otherwise. These agreements primarily relate to the Company s commercial contracts, service agreements, contracts entered into for the purchase and sale of stock or assets, operating leases and other real estate contracts, financial agreements, agreements to provide services to the Company and agreements to indemnify officers, directors and employees in the performance of their work. While the Company s aggregate indemnification obligations could result in a material liability, the Company is not aware of any matters that are expected to result in a material liability. The Company has recorded the de minimis fair value of these guarantees and contingent obligations, when applicable, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Other Contractual Commitments 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into supply contracts to purchase products for resale and service contracts for fixed asset and information technology systems. These contracts typically include either volume commitments or fixed expiration dates, termination provisions and other standard contractual considerations. As of August 3, 2024, the Company had approximately million of non-cancelable future purchase obligations, most of which will be paid and utilized in the ordinary course within one year. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company is one of dozens of companies that have been named in various lawsuits alleging that drug manufacturers, retailers and distributors contributed to the national opioid epidemic. Currently, UNFI, primarily through its subsidiary, Advantage Logistics, is named in approximately suits pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio where thousands of cases have been consolidated as Multi-District Litigation MDL ). In accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement dated January 10, 2013, between New Albertson s Inc. New Albertson s and the Company (the Stock Purchase Agreement ), the Company believes that New Albertson s has an obligation to defend and indemnify UNFI in a majority of the cases. New Albertson s originally agreed to do so under a reservation of rights, however, New Albertson s is disputing its obligation to do so. In one of the MDL cases, MDL No. 2804 filed by The Blackfeet Tribe of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, all defendants were ordered to Answer the Complaint, which UNFI did on July 26, 2019. To date, no discovery has been conducted against UNFI in any of the actions. On October 7, 2022, the MDL Court issued an order directing the Company and numerous other non-litigating defendants to submit by November 1, 2022, a list of opioid cases where the Company is named and opioid dispensing and distribution data. The Company produced the data in compliance with the order.

 causes of action against the defendants: common law fraud, fraudulent nondisclosure, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, violation of the Minnesota Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and violation of the Minnesota Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act. The plaintiffs allege that between 2006 and 2016, Supervalu overcharged the health plans by not providing the health plans, as part of usual and customary prices, the benefit of discounts given to customers purchasing prescription medication who requested that Supervalu match competitor prices. Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages. Similar to the above case, for the majority of the relevant period Supervalu and Albertson s operated as a combined company. In March 2013, Supervalu divested Albertson s and pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Albertson s is responsible for any claims regarding its pharmacies. On February 19, 2021, Albertson s and Safeway removed the case to Minnesota Federal District Court, and on March 22, 2021, plaintiffs filed a motion to remand to state court. On February 26, 2021, defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The hearing on the remand motion and motions to dismiss occurred on May 20, 2021. On September 21, 2021, the Federal District Court remanded the case to Minnesota state court and did not rule on the motion to dismiss, which was refiled in state court. On February 1, 2022, the state court denied the motion to dismiss. On November 27, 2023, the court held a scheduling conference and thereafter entered a scheduling order setting various discovery and expert deadlines. The trial date is set for July 21, 2025. The Company believes these claims are without merit and is vigorously defending this matter. 
 
 UNFI is currently subject to a qui tam action alleging violations of the False Claims Act FCA ). In United States ex rel. Schutte and Yarberry v. Supervalu, New Albertson s, Inc., et al, which is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the relators allege that defendants overcharged government healthcare programs by not providing the government, as a part of usual and customary prices, the benefit of discounts given to customers purchasing prescription medication who requested that defendants match competitor prices. The complaint was originally filed under seal and amended on November 30, 2015. The government previously investigated the relators allegations and declined to intervene. Violations of the FCA are subject to treble damages and penalties of up to a specified dollar amount per false claim. The relators elected to pursue the case on their own and have alleged FCA damages against Supervalu and New Albertson s in excess of million, not including trebling and statutory penalties. For the majority of the relevant period Supervalu and New Albertson s operated as a combined company. In March 2013, Supervalu divested New Albertson s (and related assets) pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement. Based on the claims that are currently pending and the Stock Purchase Agreement, Supervalu s share of a potential award (at the currently claimed value by the relators) would be approximately million, not including trebling and statutory penalties. Both sides moved for summary judgment. On August 5, 2019, the Court granted one of the relators summary judgment motions finding that the defendants lower matched prices are the usual and customary prices and that Medicare Part D and Medicaid were entitled to those prices. On July 2, 2020, the Court granted the defendants summary judgment motion and denied the relators motion, dismissing the case. On July 9, 2020, the relators filed a notice of appeal with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 12, 2021, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court s decision granting summary judgment in defendants favor. On June 1, 2023, the Supreme Court reversed and vacated the lower court s judgment and remanded the case to the Seventh Circuit for further proceedings. On July 27, 2023, the Seventh Circuit vacated the summary judgment order and remanded the case to the District Court. On August 22, 2023, the District Court set the trial date for April 29, 2024. On October 11, 2023, each of the Company and the relators filed a motion for summary judgment. On February 16, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to reconsider the Court s August 5, 2019 partial grant of summary judgment to the relators and to continue the trial date. On February 27, 2024, the Court granted the defendants motion for a trial date continuance and vacated the April 29, 2024 trial date. On April 26, 2024, the Court denied the defendants motion to reconsider the partial grant of summary judgment. On May 20, 2024, the District Court heard oral argument on the pending motions for summary judgment and on September 30, 2024, the Court denied both parties motions for summary judgment on scienter and granted relators motion for summary judgment on materiality. The trial is now scheduled to begin February 3, 2025.

 Not applicable. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . 
 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report (the Evaluation Date ). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 3, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on its assessment, our management concluded that, as of August 3, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. 
 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 3, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its attestation report which is included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended August 3, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Administration of Incentive Plan 
 
 This Annual Incentive Plan (the Incentive Plan of United Natural Foods, Inc. (the Company is administered by the Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of the Directors (the Board ). The Compensation Committee may delegate to certain associates or committees the authority to manage the day-to-day administrative operations of the Incentive Plan as it may deem advisable, and does hereby delegate to the Company s Senior Leadership Team (which shall include the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer, and General Counsel and Corporate Secretary) the administration of the Incentive Plan as to all associates that are not executive officers as designated by the Company s Board. Any references to the Compensation Committee s administrative authority hereunder is understood to include such delegated authority to the Senior Leadership Team 
 
 The Compensation Committee (but not including the Senior Leadership Team) reserves the right to amend, modify, or terminate the Incentive Plan at any time in its sole discretion. 
 
 The Compensation Committee shall have the authority to establish and modify the terms of any individual s participation in the Incentive Plan, to determine the amount of any incentive payments for which a participant is eligible and the performance period to which such payments relate, to establish performance objectives in respect of such performance periods and to determine whether such performance objectives were attained. The Compensation Committee is authorized to interpret the Incentive Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the Incentive Plan, and to make any other determinations that it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee may correct any defect or omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Incentive Plan in the manner and to the extent the Compensation Committee deems necessary or desirable. Any decision of the Compensation Committee in the interpretation and administration of the Incentive Plan, as described herein, shall be subject to its sole and absolute discretion and shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties concerned. Determinations made by the Compensation Committee under the Incentive Plan need not be uniform and may be made selectively among participants in the Incentive Plan, whether or not such participants are similarly situated . Any and all changes will be communicated to those associates participating in the Incentive Plan that are affected by the changes. 
 
 I. Incentive Plan Eligibility 
 
 The Compensation Committee shall determine the U.S. associates of the Company or its Subsidiaries who are eligible for participation in the Incentive Plan. 
 
 Participants in the Incentive Plan hired or promoted in the applicable fiscal year will be eligible for a prorated payout at the end of such fiscal year if the required performance objectives are achieved and the participant is actively employed with the Company on the date the payment is made. Additionally, if any participant receives a change in annual base salary (in the case of a participant who is classified as a salaried associate) or Specified Earnings (defined below) (in the case of an associate who is classified as an hourly associate) or bonus target during the performance period, the amount payable under the Incentive Plan, if any, will be prorated accordingly. In the case of a new hire, the prorated payment shall be calculated based on the number of days the participant was employed by the Company in such fiscal year compared to the total number of days in such fiscal year. In the case of a promotion, bonus target, or other change to annual base salary or Specified Earnings, the prorated payment shall be calculated based on the number of days at each rate of pay in such fiscal year, compared to the number of days in such fiscal year. 
 
 For purposes of the Incentive Plan, Specified Earnings means regular, incentive, overtime, and premium pay. 
 
 2 

All Incentive Plan participants must accept the commitment and responsibility to perform all duties in compliance with the Company s Code of Conduct. Any participant who manipulates or attempts to manipulate the Incentive Plan for personal gain at the expense of customers, other associates, or Company objectives will be subject to appropriate disciplinary actions. 
 
 Participants must not divulge to any outsider (other than the Company s financial, accounting and legal advisors) any non-public information regarding this Incentive Plan or any specific performance objectives applicable to the participant or any other participant. 
 
 Participation in the Incentive Plan does not constitute a contract or promise of employment between the Company and any participant in the Incentive Plan, and nothing in the Incentive Plan shall be construed as conferring on a participant any right to continue in the employment of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Any promise or representations, oral or written, which are inconsistent with or different from the terms of the Incentive Plan are invalid. 
 
 Participation in and receipt of payment under the Incentive Plan requires that participants comply with the covenants in Part IV below. 
 
 II. Termination Provisions 
 
 Participants in the Incentive Plan must be actively employed with the Company on the date that payment under the Incentive Plan is to be made to be eligible for such payment, except as described below or as otherwise set forth in any written agreement between the Company and the participant. Payment under the Incentive Plan is made as soon as administratively practicable after the Company s Board of Directors has approved the calculation of payments hereunder, which will generally be 10 to 12 weeks following the end of the Company s fiscal year. 
 
 If a participant s employment is terminated due to death, the Company shall pay to the participant s estate, subject to applicable withholding and deductions, any Earned Incentive Compensation (as hereinafter defined) when such Earned Incentive Compensation would otherwise be payable if the participant s employment was not terminated, but no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the end of the Company s fiscal year in which the termination date occurred. 
 
 If a participant s employment is terminated due to Retirement (as defined below), or by the Company without Cause (as hereinafter defined) under circumstances that would qualify the participant for benefits under the United Natural Foods, Inc.

Earned Incentive Compensation consists of (a) to the extent not previously paid, the incentive compensation that the participant would otherwise receive based on the Company s actual performance for the most recent fiscal year ended before the participant s termination date and (b) the Pro-Rated Portion (as hereinafter defined) of any incentive compensation that the participant would otherwise receive, based on the Company s actual performance for the fiscal year during which the participant s employment is terminated. The Pro-Rated Portion shall be the portion represented by the number of days in such fiscal year prior to the participant s termination date, compared to the total number of days in such fiscal year. 
 
 If a participant is terminated for Cause at any time, he or she will not be eligible for any payment under the Incentive Plan and shall forfeit any payments that may have been due to the participant under the Incentive Plan prior to or subsequent to the participant s employment being terminated for Cause.

Leave of Absence Policy (Long-Term and Annual Incentive Plans) (or any replacement policy) as in effect at the time such leave of absence commenced. Except as otherwise provided in a written agreement between the Company and a participant, if a participant voluntarily terminates his or her employment under circumstances that do not qualify as a Retirement or resignation for Good Reason before the date that payment under the Incentive Plan is to be made, the participant will not be eligible for any payment under the Incentive Plan.

The percentage of any amount payable pursuant to the Incentive Plan shall be based on the weights assigned to the applicable performance objective by the Compensation Committee.

The Compensation Committee shall determine whether and to what extent each performance objective has been met. In determining whether and to what extent a

performance objective has been met, the Compensation Committee may consider such matters as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. 
 
 IV. Confidential Information 
 
 (a) Confidential Information . For purposes of this Incentive Plan, Confidential Information means all business-related information belonging to the Company that is proprietary and confidential in nature, regardless of whether the information is reduced to writing or is simply in the participant s memory, that has been provided or accessible to the participant during the participant s employment with the Company, or was developed by the participant during the participant s employment with the Company. Confidential Information includes trade secrets, as defined by applicable law, and information or documents that do not meet the legal definition of a trade secret but are still proprietary, confidential, and otherwise meet the definition of Confidential Information . Confidential Information includes, without limitation, any customer lists, customer needs, price and performance information, processes, specifications, hardware, software, devices, supply sources and characteristics, business opportunities, potential business interests, marketing, promotional pricing and financing techniques, or other information relating to the business of the Company that the participant knows or should know is confidential and proprietary. The participant confirms that Confidential Information constitutes the exclusive property of the Company. Confidential Information does not include information which (i) is readily ascertainable to the general public (ii) is disclosed through no fault of the participant or (iii) is required to be disclosed pursuant to applicable law or regulation or the order of a governmental or regulatory body.

The participant agrees that Participant will immediately return to the Company upon request, but in any event upon termination of employment, any physical or electronic embodiment of any Confidential Information and or any summaries containing any Confidential Information, in whole in part, in any media. It shall be a material breach of this Incentive Plan for the participant to retain any of the Company s property, including Confidential Information in physical or electronic form, after termination of the participant s employment with the Company. 
 
 (b) Permitted Disclosures . The participant understands that nothing contained in Section IV(a) restricts or limits the participant s right to discuss or disclose information about unlawful acts in the workplace, at work-related events, or between Company employees or Company and the participant, such as harassment, discrimination, retaliation, sexual assault, or any other conduct that the participant has reason to believe is unlawful, nor does Section IV(a) prohibit the participant from discussing the participant s employment or reporting possible violations of law or regulation with the Department of Justice, the Congress, any Inspector General, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, United States Department of Labor, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Labor Relations Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or other federal government agency or state or local government agency. The participant further understands that Section IV(a) does not prohibit the participant from discussing the terms and conditions of the participant s employment with others to the extent expressly permitted by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act or to the extent that such disclosure is protected under the applicable provisions of law or regulation, including but not limited to whistleblower statutes or other similar provisions that protect such disclosure. Nor does Section IV(a) require the participant not to disclose or discuss conduct or the existence of a settlement involving conduct relating to a dispute (1) involving a nonconsensual sexual act or sexual contact, as such terms are defined in section 2246 or title 18, United States Code, or similar applicable tribal or state law or (2) relating to conduct that is alleged to constitute sexual harassment under applicable federal, tribal, or state law. 

6 

Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company has provided the participant with written notice below that the Defend Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1833(b), provides an immunity for the disclosure of a trade secret to report suspected violations of law and or in an anti-retaliation lawsuit, as follows 
 (1) IMMUNITY. An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that 
 (A) is made 
 (i) in confidence to a Federal, State or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and 
 (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or 
 (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. 
 (2) USE OF TRADE SECRET INFORMATION IN ANTI-RETALIATION LAWSUIT. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual 
 (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal and 
 (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. 
 (c) If the participant primarily resides in Wisconsin, the restrictions set forth in Section IV(a) shall apply during the participant s employment with the Company and for two years after termination of the participant s employment. 
 (d) If the participant primarily resides in Washington, nothing herein shall be used to prevent the participant from disclosing or discussing (i) conduct that the participant reasonably believes under Washington state, federal, or common law to be illegal discrimination, illegal harassment, illegal retaliation, a wage and hour violation, or sexual assault, or that is recognized as against a clear mandate of public policy and (ii) the existence of a settlement involving the conduct described in Section IV(d)(i), but the amount paid in settlement of a claim is strictly confidential. 
 (e) Participant hereby acknowledges that Participant will treat as for the Company s sole benefit, and fully and promptly disclose and assign to the Company without additional compensation, all ideas, information, discoveries, inventions and improvements which are based upon or related to any Confidential Information protected under Section IV(a) herein, and which are made, conceived or reduced to practice by Participant during Participant s period of employment by the Company and the Restricted Period. The provisions of this subsection (e) shall apply whether such ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements or knowledge are conceived, made or gained by Participant alone or with others, whether during or after usual working hours, either on or off the job, directly or indirectly related to the Company s business interests (including potential business interests), and whether or not within the realm of Participant s duties. 
 (f) Participant shall, upon request of the Company, but at no expense to participant, at any time during or after employment by the Company, sign all instruments and documents and cooperate in such other acts reasonably required to protect rights to the ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements and knowledge referred to above, including applying for, obtaining and enforcing patents and copyrights thereon in any and all countries. 
 (g) Sections IV (e) and (f) are subject to the state-specific notifications identified in Exhibit A. 
 
 7 

(h) During the one-year period following termination of the participant s employment, upon reasonable request of the Company, the participant shall cooperate in any internal or external investigation, litigation or any dispute relating to any matter in which he or she was involved during his or her employment with the Company provided, however, that the participant shall not be obligated to spend time and or travel in connection with such cooperation to the extent that it would unreasonably interfere with the participant s other commitments and obligations. The Company shall reimburse the participant for all expenses the participant reasonably incurs in so cooperating. 
 (i) Participant recognizes that the possible restrictions on the participant s activities which may occur as a result of the participant s performance of the participant s obligations under Section IV are required for the reasonable protection of the Company s legitimate business interests, including, but not limited to, its Confidential Information, trade secrets, and investments, and the participant expressly acknowledges that such restrictions are fair and reasonable for that purpose. Participant acknowledges that money damages would not be an adequate or sufficient remedy for any breach of Section IV, and that in the event that the participant breaches or threatens to breach, or the Company reasonably believes the participant is about to breach, Section IV, the Company will be entitled to injunctive relief as well as an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits, and other benefits arising from the participant s breach, which rights will be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the Company may be entitled in law or equity in addition to other rights and remedies existing in its favor, The terms of this Section shall not prevent the Company from pursuing any other available remedies for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including but not limited to the recovery of damages from the participant. 
 (j) If any portion of this Section IV is found unenforceable (despite, and after application of, any applicable right to reformation that could add or renew enforceability), then any provision(s) of any prior agreement between the parties that would provide for restriction(s) on the same or substantially similar post-employment conduct of the participant will not be considered superseded and will remain in effect, to the extent enforceable. 
 (k) Participant expressly agrees that all payments and benefits due the participant herein shall be subject to Participant s compliance with the provisions set forth in Section IV. 
 
 V. Miscellaneous Provisions 
 
 No twithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion and subject to any applicable requirements of Section 409A (as defined below), may, unless otherwise provided for in a written agreement between the Company and the participant, (i) reduce any amounts otherwise payable to a participant hereunder in order to satisfy any liabilities owed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the participant and (ii) modify (upward or downward) the amount of any incentive payment based on such criteria it shall determine, including, but not limited to, financial results, individual performance, or other factors, and may base such modification on the recommendation of a participant s manager, the performance of the participant s business unit, the Company performance, or any other factors that the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate. 
 
 In the event of any material change in the business assets, liabilities or prospects of the Company, any division or any Subsidiary, the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion and without liability to any person may make such adjustments, if any, as it deems to be equitable as to any affected terms of outstanding awards. 
 
 The Company is the sponsor and legal obligor under the Incentive Plan and shall make all payments hereunder, other than any payments to be made by any of the Company s subsidiaries (in which case payment shall be made by such subsidiary, as appropriate). The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to ensure the payment of any amounts under the Incentive Plan, and the participant s rights to the payment hereunder shall be not greater 
 
 8 

than the rights of the Company s (or its subsidiary s) unsecured creditors. All expenses involved in administering the Incentive Plan shall be borne by the Company. 
 
 Except as provided in Exhibit B, the Incentive Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed in the State of Delaware. 
 
 Each participant agrees that payouts under this Incentive Plan are subject to the Company s Recoupment (Clawback) Policy for performance-based incentive compensation or any other similar policy that may be adopted or amended thereafter by the Board or Compensation Committee from time to time, to conform to regulations related to recoupment or clawback of compensation adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and also further agrees to promptly return to the Company, if the Company shall so request, all or a portion of any incentive amounts paid to such participant pursuant to this Incentive Plan based upon financial information or performance objectives later found to be materially inaccurate and or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Company s clawback policy, a copy of which will be made available to participants. The amount to be recovered shall be equal to the excess amount paid out over the amount that would have been paid out had such financial information or performance objective been fairly stated at the time the payout was made and or otherwise in accordance with the Company s clawback policy. 
 
 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may make payments (including pro rata payments) to participants who do not meet the eligibility requirements of the Incentive Plan, including, but not limited to, the length of service requirements described in Section II above if the Compensation Committee determines that such payments are in the best interest of the Company. 
 
 The Incentive Plan is intended to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and any rules, regulations or other official guidance promulgated thereunder Section 409A and will be interpreted in a manner intended to comply with Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the participant s separation from service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A, and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such separation from service is necessary in order to prevent the imposition of any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the participant) until the date that is six months and one day following the participant s separation from service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A), if such payment or benefit is payable upon a separation from service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each payment made under the Incentive Plan shall be designated as a separate payment within the meaning of Section 409A. 
 
 If any provision of the Incentive Plan is, or becomes, or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any participant, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Incentive Plan, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction or participant and the remainder of the Incentive Plan shall remain in full force and effect.

 (1) Applies to Covered Persons who are not Insiders. 
 (2) Applies to Insiders who are not Restricted Insiders. 
 (3) Applies to Restricted Insiders who are not Directors or Section 16 Officers.

This Policy also applies to immediate family members of Covered Persons and persons who share the same household with a Covered Person, and any person or entity over which a Covered Person has control or influence with respect to a transaction in Company Securities (collectively, Related Persons ). 
 Further, even after you are no longer employed by or affiliated with the Company, you must maintain the confidentiality of any confidential or proprietary information obtained during your employment or affiliation with the Company. This Policy continues to apply to transactions in Company Securities even after your separation from the Company. If an individual is in possession of Material Nonpublic Information when his or her service terminates, that individual may not trade in Company Securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. 
 III. WHAT TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THIS POLICY

 IV. YOU ARE INDIVIDUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH THIS POLICY AND APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS 
 Covered Persons have ethical and legal obligations to maintain the confidentiality of information about the Company and to not engage in transactions in Company Securities while in possession of Material Nonpublic Information. Each individual is responsible for making sure that he or she complies with this Policy, and that Related Persons, as discussed below, also comply with this Policy. In all cases, the responsibility for determining whether an individual is in possession of Material Nonpublic Information rests with that individual, and any action on the part of the Company, the General Counsel or any other employee or director pursuant to this Policy (or otherwise) does not in any way constitute legal advice or insulate an individual from liability under applicable securities laws. You could be subject to severe legal penalties (including criminal prosecution) and disciplinary action by the Company for any conduct prohibited by applicable securities laws or this Policy , including as described in more detail in Section VII Penalties below. 
 V. POLICY AGAINST INSIDER TRADING 
 Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 prohibit any Covered Person from (i) purchasing or selling any Company 
 Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securities Page 3 of 10 

Securities if he or she has knowledge of any Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company and (ii) disclosing to any other person any Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company if it is reasonably foreseeable that such person may use that information in purchasing or selling Company Securities. Under this Policy, these same restrictions apply to Related Persons. 
 In addition, these same restrictions apply to Covered Persons and Related Persons with respect to Material Nonpublic Information concerning any other company that a Covered Person learns of in the course of his or her employment or affiliation with the Company. For example, you may not trade in the securities of other companies, such as vendors or suppliers of the Company or those companies with which the Company may be negotiating a major transaction, while in possession of Material Nonpublic Information about that company. Information that is not Material Nonpublic Information with respect to the Company may still be material to these other companies. 
 A. General Prohibition 
 Any Covered Person or any Related Persons who has Material Nonpublic Information relating to the Company may not, until the information becomes public, (i) buy or sell, directly or indirectly, Company Securities, (ii) engage in any other action to take personal advantage of that information, or (iii) pass that information on to others. In addition, any Covered Person or any Related Person who learns of Material Nonpublic Information about another entity with whom the Company does business may not trade in that entity s securities until 12 00 p.m. on the third full trading day after the information becomes public. The only exceptions to this prohibition are those described in Section VI Specific Policies ). 
 You may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in Company Securities even if you had planned to make the transaction before learning of the Material Nonpublic Information and even though it might result in a financial loss. The appearance of impropriety must be avoided to preserve the Company s reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct. 
 To ensure compliance with this Policy, all Covered Persons must 
 protect the confidentiality of Material Nonpublic Information by, for example, avoiding conversations about such information in public areas and by storing files containing Material Nonpublic Information in secure locations 
 not disclose tip Material Nonpublic Information to any other person (including family members) if that information could be used by that person for his or her direct or indirect profit by trading in the securities of companies (including the Company) to which the information relates or make recommendations or express opinions concerning transactions in the Company s (or any other company s) securities on the basis of Material Nonpublic Information 
 Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securities Page 4 of 10 

not trade in a company s securities when they learn, in the course of working for the Company, some Material Nonpublic Information about that company with which the Company does business, including a customer or supplier of the Company 
 decline comment and refer all inquiries concerning the Company which may be received from the media to the principal leader of the Company s Communications Department or from the financial community to the principal leader of the Company s Investor Relations Department and 
 report any unauthorized disclosure of Material Nonpublic Information, whether inadvertent or otherwise, immediately to our General Counsel. 
 The prohibition on tipping set out above includes supposedly anonymous communications such as in Internet chat rooms, blogs, and bulletin or message boards. Tipping may subject the tipper to criminal and civil penalties, even when the tipper does not profit by the prohibited disclosure. 
 In addition, any Covered Person who is no longer employed by, or affiliated with, the Company, but who has Material Nonpublic Information must continue to comply with this Policy and may not trade in Company Securities until 12 00 p.m. on the third full trading day after the Material Nonpublic Information in his or her possession has become public or until such information is no longer material. 
 Because securities laws regarding insider trading are complex, you should contact our General Counsel if you have any questions about whether information in your possession is Material Nonpublic Information or if a proposed transaction or communication would violate the securities laws or the terms of this Policy. Our General Counsel will determine the appropriate action. Please direct your questions and requests to email address . 
 B. What is Material Nonpublic Information 
 Material Nonpublic Information is information about a company that is both material and nonpublic . 
 For purposes of this Policy, information about a company is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the information important in deciding to buy, sell or hold a security of that company. Information may also be material if a reasonable investor would view the information as having significantly altered the total mix of information available about a particular investment or security. In other words, materiality may depend in part upon the context of other information that is available concerning the applicable company. Information that is not material in and of itself but which, when combined with other information, significantly alters the total mix of information available concerning a particular company, that seemingly unimportant piece of information may be material. 
 Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securities Page 5 of 10 

Information is nonpublic unless and until it has been broadly disseminated or made widely available to the investing public generally, such as by means of a press release carried over a major news service or a public filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 
 C. What Information is Material 
 Although it is not possible to list all types of material information, the following are examples of the types of information that are particularly sensitive and should be treated as material 
 financial performance, especially quarterly or annual earnings information and guidance, including estimates or revisions 
 performance against or changes to externally communicated financial, sales or other performance targets 
 performance against or changes to financial, sales or other internal budgets forecasts 
 discussions, even if preliminary in nature, proposals or agreements for a merger, acquisition or divestiture or a tender offer for another company s securities 
 the loss or gain of a significant contract, sale, order or customer affiliation 
 liquidity problems or significant increases and decreases in total assets 
 management problems or any actual or potential change in control or changes in key members of management 
 judgments, threatened litigation, government investigations or administrative actions, or material developments in such matters 
 a major cybersecurity breach 
 significant food safety issues or major recalls 
 significant labor negotiations or disputes, including possible strikes 
 significant changes in business strategies, pricing strategies, sales volumes, mix of sales or market share, accounting or marketing 
 significant changes or developments in products or products lines 
 the public or private sale of additional securities 
 changes in debt ratings or analyst upgrades or downgrades of securities 
 Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securities Page 6 of 10 

the establishment, commencement or discontinuation of a program to repurchase securities and 
 stock splits or changes in dividend policies. 
 The list above does not include all of the information that could be deemed to be material . Further, the courts and the SEC have declined to identify all information that could be deemed to be material. If you are uncertain whether you are in possession of Material Nonpublic Information, you should consult with our General Counsel. All types of information can be considered material. It is only upon specific judgment, based on all the evidence available, as to whether the information does constitute Material Nonpublic Information . 
 D. What Information is Nonpublic 
 Information is nonpublic unless and until it has been broadly disseminated or made widely available to the investing public generally, such as by means of a press release carried over a major news service or a public filing with the SEC. 
 
 There also must be adequate time after the release of a press release or the filing of a report with the SEC for the market, as a whole, to digest the information as a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed by the marketplace until 12 00 p.m. on the third full trading day after the information is released. The distribution of information through narrower channels, such as postings on websites that are not widely viewed, may be insufficient to make it public. Also, the fact that nonpublic information is reflected in rumors in the marketplace or on the Internet does not mean that the information has been publicly disseminated. It is important to note that even after information becomes public, many aspects relating to a matter may remain nonpublic. Information that is available to the public is public information one may need to know where to look or whom to ask for it, but information that is available to anyone is considered public information. 
 
 If you are uncertain whether certain information has been publicly disseminated, you should consult with our General Counsel or assume that the information is nonpublic and material and treat it as confidential. In general, it is better to be safe than sorry. 
 
 VI. SPECIFIC POLICIES 
 To clarify the Company s policies regarding certain frequently occurring situations in which the Covered Persons may trade in Company Securities, the Company has established the following policies. If you are not certain whether a proposed transaction complies with the policies described below, you should contact our General Counsel. 
 A. Employee Benefit Plans 
 Covered Persons who participate in the Company s employee benefit plans (including the Company s deferred compensation plan(s) and 401(k) retirement plan(s)) may not engage in any transactions under these plans to the extent the transactions involve (i) changes in contribution elections to a plan s Company stock fund, and (ii) intra-plan transfers into or out of Company stock 
 Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securities Page 7 of 10 

funds, during either blackout periods (for Restricted Insiders who are subject to the Company s blackout periods, as described in the Additional Polices) or at any time while they possess Material Nonpublic Information. The mere receipt by a Covered Person of an equity award during any such period, would not, however, violate this Policy. In addition, the following transactions would not violate this Policy 
 automatic payroll deductions that (i) are used to purchase Company common stock under Company benefit plans (such as the Company s 401(k) retirement plan(s)) and (ii) are made in accordance with a contribution election made when you were not aware of Material Nonpublic Information and 
 elections to have the Company withhold shares to satisfy tax withholding requirements on the exercise or vesting of equity awards, provided that your award agreement or the underlying equity incentive or benefit plan permits shares to be withheld for this purpose. 
 B. Option Exercises 
 Restricted Insiders who have options or other rights granted by the Company to purchase Company Securities from the Company may exercise the options or purchase rights only during the established quarterly open trading window. Covered Persons may not effect a net exercise (or other exercise in which you deliver Company Securities to the Company in order to pay the exercise price) with respect to options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock during a blackout period (if you are a Restricted Insider who is subject to the Company s blackout periods, as described in the Additional Polices) or at any time while you possess Material Nonpublic Information. Please be aware that any subsequent sale of securities purchased in accordance with this Policy (including sales made pursuant to a broker-assisted cashless exercise of stock options) must be (i) made during an open trading window (if you are a Restricted Insiders who are subject to the Company s blackout periods, as described in the Additional Policies), (ii) made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-l Plan or (iii) otherwise approved by our General Counsel. 
 C. Restricted Stock Awards 
 This Policy does not apply to the vesting of restricted stock, or the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of any restricted stock. This Policy does, however, apply to any market sale of restricted stock. 
 D. Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 From time to time, the Company may adopt employee stock purchase plans. This Policy does not apply to purchases of Company Securities in such an employee stock purchase plan resulting from your periodic or lump sum contribution of money into the plan pursuant to the election you made at the time of your enrollment in the plan. This Policy does apply, however, to your initial election to participate in a Company employee stock purchase plan, changes to your election to participate 
 Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securities Page 8 of 10 

in the plan for any enrollment period and to your sales of Company Securities purchased pursuant to the plan. 
 E. Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 From time to time, the Company may adopt dividend reinvestment plans. This Policy does not apply to purchases of Company Securities under such a dividend reinvestment plan resulting from your reinvestment of dividends paid on Company Securities. This Policy does apply, however, to voluntary purchases of Company Securities resulting from additional contributions you choose to make in a Company dividend reinvestment plan, and to your election to participate in the plan or increase your level of participation in the plan. 
 F. Gifts 
 Covered Persons and Related Persons may at any time make bona fide gifts of Company Securities (such as charitable donations, family gifts or estate planning transfers). Charitable gifts that give rise to preferential tax outcomes, however, are prohibited while a Covered Person has Material Nonpublic Information. Depending on the circumstances, recipients of gifts may be subject to restrictions on subsequent sales of such securities. Gifts that are designed to circumvent the insider trading rules are not permitted. Restricted Insiders must consult with, and obtain prior approval from, our General Counsel or a member of our securities laws group prior to making any gifts or contributions of Company Securities . 
 Directors and Section 16 Officers (defined below) are required to report gifts on Form 4 within two days of such gift. 
 G. Approved Pre-Planned Trading Programs 
 Covered Persons and Related Persons may buy or sell Company Securities pursuant to certain pre-planned trading programs that comply with Rule 10b-5 and this Policy (including the 10b5-1 Trading Plan Guidelines attached hereto as Exhibit A (a Rule 10b5-1 Plan ). Once a Rule 10b5-1 Plan has been put in place, purchases or sales of Company Securities may proceed in accordance with that plan even if you become aware of Material Nonpublic Information following the adoption of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan. 
 Additional Rule 10b5-1 Plan policies apply to Insiders (who are subject to the Company s preclearance procedures) and Restricted Insiders (who are subject to the Company s blackout periods), as described in the Additional Policies. 
 VII. PENALTIES 
 A. Criminal and Civil Penalties 
 A violation of the foregoing responsibilities may expose the Company and the individuals involved to severe adverse consequences, including jail terms, criminal fines of several times the amount of profits gained or losses avoided, disgorgement of profits, treble damages, imposition of an injunction, monetary damages and suspension of public trading in Company Securities. Given the severity of the potential penalties, compliance with this Policy is absolutely mandatory. 
 Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securities Page 9 of 10 

Federal criminal authorities may seek penalties that include fines of up to 5,000,000 and 20 years in prison. In addition, current law authorizes enforcement authorities to award substantial dollar bounties to persons who provide information leading to the imposition of an insider trading penalty. 
 The SEC can also seek substantial civil penalties from any person who, at the time of an insider trading violation, directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed such violation. SEC penalties include fines of up to three times the gains received or losses avoided and can be imposed upon the trader and the tipper i.e. , the person who disclosed Material Nonpublic Information to the person who actually made the trade), even when the tipper did not profit from the transaction. The SEC has been granted broad authority to seek any equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors for violations of any provisions of the securities laws. The SEC also may bar a violator from future service as a director or officer of a public company. 
 Finally, private lawsuits also may be brought against illegal traders by persons who traded without access to the Material Nonpublic Information and incurred losses. 
 B. Company Imposed Penalties 
 The Company reserves the right to penalize Covered Persons for violations of this Policy by the Covered Person, or any Related Person, including termination of employment. 
 VIII. COMPANY ASSISTANCE 
 Compliance with this Policy is of the utmost importance both for the Covered Persons and the Company. Any person who has a question about this Policy, or its application to any proposed transaction, may obtain additional guidance from the General Counsel. A Covered Person shall not try to resolve uncertainties he or she encounters as the rules relating to insider trading are often complex, not always intuitive and carry severe consequences. Please direct your questions and requests to email address .

ADDITIONAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR INSIDERS 
 I. INTRODUCTION 
 The Company has adopted these Additional Policies and Procedures for Insiders (these Additional Policies with respect to trading in Company Securities by Insiders and Restricted Insiders. These Additional Policies supplement the Company s Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securities (the Base Policy and together with the Additional Policies, collectively this Policy ). Capitalized terms used in these Additional Policies and not otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Base Policy. 
 These Additional Policies are designed to help Insiders transact in Company Securities in a manner that protects the Insiders and the Company because of the extra public scrutiny faced by Insiders as a result of their positions with the Company. These Additional Policies are also designed to help members of the Company s board of directors and Section 16 Officers (as defined below) comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act. 
 All persons subject to these Additional Policies are responsible for reading these policies and procedures and complying with them. You should direct any questions about the application of these Additional Policies, or requests for exceptions, to our General Counsel. Although our General Counsel generally is responsible for the implementation of these Additional Policies, he or she may designate associates to carry out any of the duties described below. 
 II. WHO IS SUBJECT TO THESE ADDITIONAL POLICIES 
 Section III Preclearance and Broker Interface Procedures and Section IV Rules for Specific Transactions of these Additional Policies apply to all Insiders i.e. , the Company s directors and executive officers, associates with a title of Vice President or higher, Internal Audit, Accounting Finance, and Legal personnel with a title of Director or higher and certain other associates who may periodically have access to Material Nonpublic Information, including members of the corporate finance external reporting and internal audit departments). 
 Section V Blackout Periods of these Additional Policies applies to Insiders who are Restricted Insiders i.e. , the Company s directors and executive officers, associates with a title of Vice President or higher, Accounting Finance department personnel with a title of Director or higher who are involved in financial reporting or financial planning & analysis, and certain other associates who routinely have access to Material Nonpublic Information). 
 Section VI Reporting and Other Trading Restrictions Under Section 16 of the Exchange Act applies to the Company s directors and Section 16 Officers. 
 For purposes of these Additional Policies, the Company generally considers the following persons to be Section 16 Officers 
 Additional Policies and Procedures for Insiders Page 1 of 8 

the Company s principal executive officer, 
 the Company s principal financial officer, 
 the Company s principal accounting officer, 
 the Company s Chief Human Resources Officer, 
 the Company s General Counsel, 
 any vice president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division or function, and 
 any other officer who performs a policy making function. 
 The Board of Directors determines the Company s Section 16 Officers from time to time. The General Counsel may also determine that certain associates are Insiders or Restricted Insiders from time to time. You are receiving these Additional Policies because you are an Insider for purposes of these Additional Policies. 
 III. PRECLEARANCE AND BROKER INTERFACE PROCEDURES 
 A. Preclearance Requirement 
 All Insiders and Related Persons must obtain preclearance from our General Counsel or a member of the Company s securities law group for any transaction involving Company Securities (including a securities plan transaction such as an option exercise, a gift, a loan or pledge, a contribution to a trust or any other transfer). This includes transactions by entities over which an Insider exercises control. The preclearance requirement applies regardless of whether a blackout period is in effect at the time of the intended transaction, but does not apply to trades pursuant to an approved Rule 10b5-l Plan. 
 B. Preclearance Procedure 
 A request for preclearance must be submitted to our General Counsel or a member of Company s securities law group prior to consummation of an intended transaction. It is recommended that associates request an interview at least 24 hours in advance of the intended transaction to allow time to schedule an interview. The request must be in writing and can be sent to email address . Following receipt of the request, the General Counsel, or his or her designee will conduct a preclearance interview with the Insider. You must speak to a member of the Company s securities law group to obtain preclearance authorization before trading in Company Securities . 
 The General Counsel will then advise the applicable Insider whether the transaction is permitted and whether he or she may proceed with the transaction. If preclearance is denied, the fact of such denial must be kept confidential by the person requesting such preclearance. Unless revoked, preclearance of a transaction is valid only for a two-trading day period. If the transaction order is not placed within that period, clearance of the transaction must be re-requested. 
 Additional Policies and Procedures for Insiders Page 2 of 8 

IV. RULES FOR SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS 
 A. Prohibited Transactions 
 The Company considers it inappropriate for Insiders to engage in speculative transactions in Company Securities or in certain other transactions in Company Securities that may lead to inadvertent violations of insider trading laws or that create a conflict of interest for the Insider. Therefore, Insiders may not engage in any of the following transactions with respect to Company Securities 
 short sales 
 buying or selling options to purchase Company Securities (other than options granted pursuant to the Company s equity-based compensation plans), including puts or calls 
 holding Company Securities in margin accounts and or pledging Company Securities as collateral 
 hedging transactions (including with respect to any Rule 10b5-1 Plan) and 
 placing standing orders with a broker to buy or sell Company Securities that have a duration in excess of three business days (other than when such orders are made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Plan). 
 In addition, from time to time, the Company may determine that other types of transactions by Insiders in Company Securities shall be prohibited or shall be permitted only with the prior written consent of the General Counsel. 
 B. Awards Under Equity-Based Compensation Plans 
 The Company s policy is not to make equity awards during a blackout period. However, if the Company were to make an equity award to you during any such period, your receipt of that award would not be in violation of this Policy. In addition, the vesting, during a blackout period or at any other time in which the recipient has Material Nonpublic Information, of an equity award granted by the Company would not violate this Policy, provided that the vesting schedule for such equity award was determined in accordance with the applicable equity-based compensation plan and the recipient s award agreement and the recipient could not control when such vesting occurred. The exercise, during a blackout period or at any other time in which you have Material Nonpublic Information, of tax withholding rights pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares to satisfy tax withholding requirements also would not violate this Policy, provided that your award agreement or equity incentive plan pursuant to which the award was granted permits the shares to be withheld for this purpose. 
 You may not, however, do any of the following during a blackout period or at any other time in which you have Material Nonpublic Information 
 Additional Policies and Procedures for Insiders Page 3 of 8 

except as otherwise permitted under this Policy, enter into any transactions under the Company s deferred compensation plans, and any other benefit plans adopted by the Company from time to time, to the extent the transactions involve an investment in Company Securities or 
 elect to participate in a Company benefit plan if that election involves a decision to invest in Company Securities. 
 Please be aware that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any subsequent sale of securities received under the Company s equity-based compensation plans in accordance with this section (including in connection with a broker-assisted cashless exercise of stock options) must be made in a manner that complies with these Additional Policies e.g. , all Insiders must obtain preclearance and Restricted Insiders may not transact during blackout periods ). 
 V. BLACKOUT PERIODS 
 A. Blackout Periods 
 The Company prohibits Restricted Insiders from trading in Company Securities during the blackout periods described below. The prohibition from trading during these blackout periods does not apply to certain transactions described in Section VI Specific Policies in the Base Policy or certain transactions described above in Section IV.B Awards Under Equity-Based Compensation Plans ). However, please be aware that you must consult our General Counsel before trading in Company Securities if you think you may have any Material Nonpublic Information, even during periods that are not blackout periods (except as provided under Rule 10b5-1 Plan Trading below). Our General Counsel, in consultation with our outside legal counsel (as appropriate), will make the final determination as to whether you may trade in Company Securities given your knowledge of such information. 
 1. Quarterly Blackout Periods 
 The Company prohibits Restricted Insiders from trading in Company Securities during the quarterly blackout periods scheduled in advance and set out in a memorandum provided to such persons at the beginning of each quarterly open window period. Our scheduled quarterly blackout periods shall commence on the date set in advance by the Company s General Counsel, which will generally be no later than the fifteenth business day of the last accounting period during each fiscal quarter and end at 12 00 p.m. on the third full trading day following the public disclosure of our financial results for such fiscal quarter. During these periods, Restricted Insiders generally possess, or are presumed to possess, Material Nonpublic Information about the Company s financial results. If you have questions regarding the quarterly blackout periods for the current fiscal year, please contact email address . 
 The trading restrictions imposed in quarterly blackout periods do not apply to transactions made under an approved Rule 10b5-l Plan, although Rule 10b5-l Plans may not be adopted during a quarterly blackout period. 
 Additional Policies and Procedures for Insiders Page 4 of 8 

2. Special Event Blackout Periods 
 In addition, from time to time Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company may be pending and not publicly disclosed, including but not limited to the gain or loss of a significant customer, entry into merger or asset purchase agreements, significant personnel changes, results of certain negotiations or interim earnings guidance. Prior to public disclosure of this Material Nonpublic Information, the Company may impose a special event blackout period during which Restricted Insiders, and any other individuals notified by the Company, will be prohibited from trading in Company Securities. These special event blackout periods will be announced orally, by email or by other appropriate communication. The existence of a special event blackout period will not be announced broadly within the Company rather, the announcement will be made only to those individuals who are aware of the Material Nonpublic information which requires the trading blackout. 
 The trading restrictions imposed in special event blackout periods do not apply to transactions made under an approved Rule 10b5-l Plan, although Rule 10b5-l Plans may not be adopted during a special event blackout period. 
 3. Administrative Blackout Periods 
 The Company s Restricted Insiders are prohibited from discretionary trading in Company Securities during administrative blackout periods under its 401(k) plan and other Company retirement plans that include Company Securities. Our General Counsel will advise you whenever an administrative blackout period is imposed with respect to the Company s 401(k) and other retirement plans. 
 Limited exceptions apply to administrative blackout periods, and Restricted Insiders should consult with our General Counsel prior to attempting to trade in Company Securities during any such period. Please be aware that any profit realized from a transaction during an administrative blackout period is recoverable by the Company without regard to intent. In addition, unlike Section 16 of the Exchange Act, no matching transaction is required in order to impose the disgorgement penalty. 
 4. Applicability to Family Members 
 The Company also requires Related Persons of Restricted Insiders to refrain from trading in Company Securities during blackout periods. While there is no violation of insider trading rules if it can be shown that a family member or other person associated with a Restricted Insider acted independently when trading and without knowledge of Material Nonpublic Information, a strong presumption may arise that Material Nonpublic Information has been shared with such person by the Restricted Insider. 
 B. Open Trading Windows 
 Upon receiving preclearance from the General Counsel or a member of the Company s securities law group (see Section III above), Restricted Insiders are permitted to trade in Company Securities when no blackout period is in effect. Generally, that means that Restricted Insiders may trade during the period beginning on the first day after a quarterly blackout period ends and ending on 
 Additional Policies and Procedures for Insiders Page 5 of 8 

the day that the next quarterly blackout period begins (see Section V.A.1 above). However, even during this trading window, a Restricted Insider who is in possession of any Material Nonpublic Information should not trade in Company Securities until (a) the information has been made publicly available or is no longer material and (b) the General Counsel or a member of the Securities Law group has approved preclearance pursuant to Section III above. In addition, the Company may close this trading window if a special blackout period under Section V.A.2 or V.A.3 is imposed and will re-open the trading window once the special blackout period has ended. 
 VI. REPORTING AND OTHER TRADING RESTRICTIONS UNDER SECTION 16 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT 
 A. Section 16(a) Reporting Requirements 
 Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s directors, Section 16 Officers and 10 beneficial owners (collectively Section 16 Persons to file beneficial ownership reports in connection with their purchases and sales of Company Securities. SEC rules require that all filings be made with the SEC electronically and posted on the Company s website. 
 The consequences for failure to file a Form 3, 4 or 5 or failure to file on a timely basis could result in civil penalties, including substantial monetary penalties and cease and desist orders prohibiting the Section 16 Person from trading in Company Securities for a certain period of time. Criminal penalties could be imposed for a willful failure to comply with reporting provisions. Further, the Company is required to disclose in its annual proxy statement the names of all Section 16 Persons who have failed to timely file all required Section 16(a) reports. 
 1. Form 3 
 A Section 16 Person must file a Form 3 (entitled Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities with the SEC to report that he or she is a Section 16 Person and his or her ownership interests in the Company. Anyone becoming a Section 16 Person must file a Form 3 within 10 days after becoming a Section 16 Person. 
 2. Forms 4 and 5 
 A Section 16 Person must file a Form 4 (entitled Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership with the SEC to report a transaction within two business days after the date of such transaction if it results in a change in his or her beneficial ownership of the Company s equity securities. Such transactions now include the disposition through a bona fide gift. There are three general exceptions to the two-business day reporting requirement. 
 First, the following types of transactions may be reported on a Form 4 within two business days following the date the Section 16 Person receives notice of the transaction (but in no event later than five business days following the transaction), rather than two business days following the date on which the transaction occurs 
 a transaction pursuant to a Rule 10b5-l plan under which the Section 16 Person does not select the date on which the purchases or sales take place and 
 Additional Policies and Procedures for Insiders Page 6 of 8 

a discretionary transaction (as defined in Rule 16b-3) pursuant to an employee benefit plan for which the Section 16 Person does not select the date on which transactions take place (such as transfers in or out of, or cash withdrawals from, a Company stock fund in a 401(k) plan or other employee benefit plan). 
 Second, certain transactions may, and in a few instances must, be reported on a year end Form 5. A Form 5 must be filed with the SEC within 45 days after the end of such fiscal year by each person who was a Section 16 Person for any part of a company s fiscal year (unless he or she has no transactions to report on the Form 5). Section 16 Persons also must report on a Form 5 all transactions that occurred during the fiscal year that should have been, but were not, reported earlier on Form 4. 
 Third, the following types of transactions do not trigger any Form 4 or Form 5 filing requirement 
 an acquisition under an employee stock purchase plan 
 a transaction (other than a discretionary transaction under certain employee benefit plans, such as pension plans, 40l(k) plans or related excess benefit plans 
 an acquisition through a stock split, stock dividend or other pro rata distribution to stockholders of the Company 
 an acquisition under certain dividend or interest reinvestment plans and 
 an acquisition or disposition as a result of a domestic relations orders (such as a divorce decree). 
 Although these transactions do not require the filing of a Form 4 or Form 5, the next Form 4 or Form 5 filed after the occurrence of one of these transactions should reflect the effects of these transactions in the column reporting post-transaction security ownership. 
 3. Preparation of Forms 3, 4 and 5 
 Although the responsibility for the timely filing of reports and compliance with trading restrictions rests with each individual required to report or comply, the Company will prepare and file Forms 3, 4 and 5 on behalf of Section 16 Persons. All Forms 3, 4 and 5 prepared on behalf of a Section 16 Person will be based on information provided by the Section 16 Person. Accordingly, all Section 16 Persons must proactively communicate with the securities law group regarding any transaction or proposed transaction in Company securities. 
 In order to enable the Company to prepare and file the Forms 3, 4 and 5 on a timely basis, we must have on file an executed power of attorney authorizing the designated individuals to sign and file Section 16 reports on your behalf. Execution of this power of attorney will not preclude you from preparing, filing and signing these Section 16 reports if you choose to do so. However, having the form on file with the Company will enable the designated individuals to sign and timely file the Section 16 reports on your behalf if you are not available, thus preventing a violation of the 
 Additional Policies and Procedures for Insiders Page 7 of 8 

securities laws. Please contact our email address to obtain a blank form of power of attorney if we do not already have an executed power of attorney on file for you. 
 B. Section 16(b) Short-Swing Profit Liability 
 Section16(b) of the Exchange Act allows a Company to recover any profit realized by one of its Section 16 Persons resulting from any combination of purchases and sales of the Company s equity securities within a period of less than six months. Such liability arises without regard to whether any such transactions occur outside of the blackout periods referred to above. Profits are determined for this purpose by matching the highest sales price during the period with the lowest purchase price and are to be recovered even if the Section 16 Person realized no actual profit for the period or he or she sustained a net loss. Although the purpose of the statute is to prevent trading on the basis of Material Nonpublic Information, the recovery provision operates without regard to the intent of the Section 16 Person or the actual possession of Material Nonpublic Information and may not be waived by the Company. 
 The restrictions on short-swing trading apply not only to trading in Company Securities but also to any derivative security. Thus, for example, a grant or exercise of options (other than grants or exercises made under a plan that is exempt from Section 16(b)) would be considered to be a purchase or sale of Company Securities under Section 16. Other transactions not necessarily thought to involve purchases, such as corporate mergers, also may be covered. The SEC has exempted certain transactions, such as purchases under employee benefit plans that have been approved by stockholders or the board of directors, from the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 (but not the reporting provisions). The Company s Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, Amended and Restated 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, Amended and Restated 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and 2002 Stock Incentive Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan have all been approved by the Company s Board of Directors and stockholders. Section 16 Persons remain subject to these Section 16 requirements and restrictions for a period of up to six months after terminating their positions with the Company. 
 VII. INTERPRETATION AND AMENDMENT 
 The Company s General Counsel and Corporate Secretary is authorized, empowered and directed to oversee the administration of the Insider Trading Policy, including rendering conclusive interpretations of the Insider Trading Policy and any modifications to the Insider Trading Policy that such officer deems necessary, appropriate and in the best interests of the Company (provided such modifications do not substantively change the Insider Trading Policy). 

Additional Policies and Procedures for Insiders Page 8 of 8 

EXHIBIT A 
 GUIDELINES FOR RULE 10b5-1 PLANS 
 I. INTRODUCTION 
 To avoid potential liability for insider trading, a Covered Person may wish to rely upon the affirmative defenses established by Rule 10b5-l under the Exchange Act. Rule 10b5-l is available to an individual or entity who purchases or sells a security under a binding contract, specific instruction or written plan that the person or entity put into place before becoming aware of Material Nonpublic Information. This is referred to as a Rule 10b5-l Plan. 
 Rule 10b5-1 provides a defense from insider trading liability. In order to be eligible to rely on this defense, a person must enter into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan that meets the conditions specified in Rule 10b5-1. Rule 10b5-1 presents an opportunity for Covered Persons to establish plans to sell or purchase Company Securities even when in possession of Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company. Rule 10b5-1 only provides an affirmative defense if there is an insider trading lawsuit. It does not prevent anyone from bringing a lawsuit, nor does it prevent the media from reporting on any transactions executed pursuant to a Rule 10b5-l Plan. 
 You have the ultimate and exclusive responsibility for adhering to these guidelines and the requirements set forth herein. Any action on the part of the Company, any member of the Company s legal department, or any other employee pursuant to these guidelines (or otherwise) does not in any way constitute legal advice or insulate you from liability under applicable securities laws. As such, if you violate these guidelines, the Company may take disciplinary action, including dismissal for cause. You must notify the General Counsel if you become aware of a breach of these guidelines, either by you or by another person subject to these guidelines. 
 II. CREATING A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN 
 Insiders who participate in a Company stock incentive plan have accounts maintained by broker . Covered Persons may also have accounts with other traditional brokers. Most traditional brokers offer a form of Rule 10b5-1 Plan that Covered Persons can use to establish arrangements to purchase or sell Company Securities. Insiders who wish to adopt such a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must submit the plan to the General Counsel for review and approval. The General Counsel may require that your broker modify its form of Rule 10b5-1 Plan to comply with these guidelines. Please direct your Rule 10b5-1 requests to email address . 
 To create a Rule 10b5-l Plan, you must enter into a written plan for trading securities that has the following attributes. The plan must 
 Be entered into in good faith at a time when you do not possess Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company . Your Rule 10b5-1 Plan may not be entered into as part of a plan or scheme to otherwise trade 
 Guidelines for 10b5-1 Plans EXHIBIT A Page 1 of 4 

on the basis of Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company. To comply with these requirements, all Insiders must complete the preclearance process prior to entering into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan. Restricted Insiders may not enter into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan during a blackout period. Additionally, Directors and Section 16 Officers must personally certify pursuant to a representation in a Rule 10b5-1 plan that (i) they are not aware of any Material Nonpublic Information about the security or issuer and (ii) they are adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of this section. You must act in good faith for the duration of the plan. For example, you should not improperly influence the timing of a corporate disclosure to benefit a trade scheduled to occur under your Rule 10b5-1 plan. 
 Be in writing and preapproved by the General Counsel . The General Counsel must approve your written Rule 10b5-1 Plan before you may enter into it. 
 Include appropriate trading instructions . You may either specify the price, number of shares and date of trades ahead of time or provide a formula or other instructions by which your broker can determine the price, amount and date of trades. Alternatively, you may simply authorize your broker to make purchase and sale decisions on your behalf without any control or influence by you. 
 Limitation on multiple plans. Generally, multiple overlapping plans are prohibited. You may maintain two, separate Rule 10b5-1 plans, so long as trading under the later plan is not authorized to begin until after all trades under the earlier plan are completed or expire without execution, and provided that the later plan observes an effective cooling-off period (i.e., the applicable cooling-off period that would apply if the later plan were deemed to be put in place the day the earlier plan was terminated and the applicable cooling-off period were then observed). 
 Prohibit you from exercising any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded, or the date of the trade . You may delegate discretionary authority to your broker, but in no event may you consult with your broker regarding executing transactions, or otherwise disclose information to your broker concerning the Company that might influence the execution of transactions, under your Rule 10b5-1 Plan after it commences. 
 Include a 30-day cooling off period between your adoption or modification of your Rule 10b5-1 Plan and the first possible transactions thereunder . 
 Guidelines for 10b5-1 Plans EXHIBIT A Page 2 of 4 

For Directors and Section 16 Officers, include a cooling off period between your adoption or modification of your Rule 10b5-1 Plan and the first possible transactions thereunder that lasts until the later of 
 o the 90th day following the plan adoption or modification, or 
 o two business days following the disclosure in Form 10-K or 10-Q of the Company s financial results for the first quarter in which the plan was adopted or modified, 
 but in no case is the cooling-off period required to exceed 120 days. 
 The cooling off period is designed to minimize the risk that a claim will be made that you were aware of Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company when you entered into the Rule 10b5-1 Plan and that the plan was not entered into in good faith. 
 Include an expiration date that is at least six months but not more than 18 months from the effective date of your Trading Plan . We will not approve plans with terms less than 6 months or in excess of 18 months. Shorter-term plans may be viewed as an attempt to make advantageous short-term trades, and longer-term plans are likely to have to be amended or terminated, which defeats the ultimate purpose of Rule 10b5-1 Plans. 
 III. TRADING OUTSIDE YOUR RULE 10B5-1 PLAN 
 You may only purchase or sell Company Securities outside of your Rule 10b5-1 Plan in accordance with the Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securities . In addition, you may not buy or sell Company Securities in an effort to use a hedging strategy to offset your plan trades while a plan is in effect. Any trading outside of your Rule 10b5-1 Plan will be subject to heightened scrutiny for potential hedging and, depending on the circumstances, it is generally advisable not to engage in any trading outside the plan. 
 IV. AMENDING, SUSPENDING OR TERMINATING YOUR RULE 10B5-1 PLAN 
 Amendments, including suspensions, and terminations will be viewed in hindsight and could call into question whether the Rule 10b5-1 Plan was entered into in good faith. As a result, amendments and terminations of Rule 10b5-1 Plans require preapproval of the General Counsel or a member of the Company s securities law group following a preclearance interview, which will inquire into the change in circumstances that has occurred since the inception of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan that is giving rise to the requested amendment or termination. Scheduled sales or purchases of Company Securities pursuant to your Rule 10b5-1 Plan will not be halted during the pendency of your amendment or termination request. The Company has the right at any time to require additional and or different requirements in connection with the amendment or termination of a trading plan in order to protect you and the Company from potential liability. Further, your Rule 10b5-1 Plan 
 Guidelines for 10b5-1 Plans EXHIBIT A Page 3 of 4 

may be terminated or suspended by the Company at any time and for any reason. In addition, you may voluntarily amend or terminate your Rule 10b5-1 Plan, subject to the following conditions 
 You may not amend or terminate your Rule 10b5-1 Plan while in possession of Material Nonpublic Information 
 You must sign a certificate in favor of the Company and your broker affirmatively stating you do not possess Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company at the time of the amendment or termination 
 Restricted Insiders may not amend or terminate Rule 10b5-1 Plans during blackout periods 
 Your amendment must include a cooling off period consistent with those required of a new plan as outlined above between your commitment to such amendment and any trades under the amended plan and 
 You will be limited to one amendment or suspension of your Rule 10b5-1 Plan during its term. 
 V. ADDITIONAL COMPANY GUIDELINES 
 None of the requirements or plan terms currently contemplated by these guidelines are exhaustive or limiting on the Company. The Company has the right to require the inclusion of additional provisions in your Rule 10b5-1 Plan designed to protect you and or the Company, whether before or after the Rule 10b5-1 Plan has been approved by the General Counsel, or to delete or amend existing provisions.
