ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Keemo
Fashion Group Limited, a Nevada corporation the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April
22, 2022. 

KEEMO
Fashion Group Limited is a company that operates in the apparel and garment trade industry through wholesaling men s and women s
apparel to retailers in Asian countries. At present, the Company has primarily focused its efforts on attracting small to medium apparel
and garment retailers by wholesaling low to mid-range apparel and garments. We do not maintain and operate any production and manufacturing
of apparel facility or machine and equipment. 

The
Company s executive office is located at 69, Wanke Boyu, Xili Liuxin 1 st Rd, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518052,
China.

Description
of Business 

Keemo
Fashion Group Limited, a Nevada corporation the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April
22, 2022. 

On
April 22, 2022 Ms. Liu Lu was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director. 

Primarily,
the products that we carry are targeted towards customers, both men and women, from 18 to 40 years of age. It is the company s
belief that the products we wholesale have an appealing presentation, cover a diverse range of clothing and garment types, are stylish
for any occasion (including casual, work, and dressy), and they are offered at accessible price points. We believe that this combination
of factors will assist our growth moving forward and that we have the opportunity to capture a significant portion of the growing apparel
and garment market in Asian countries specifically. 

At
present, the Company sells all of its products through word-of-mouth and utilization of our sole officer s business network and
various connections. Ms. Liu, our sole officer and director, has broad knowledge and experience in marketing strategies and promotional
activities. She is familiar with marketing execution and promotional marketing methodology, which she intends to utilize to assist the
Company to gain market awareness and locate potential distributors as precisely and efficiently as possible. 

Business
Model 

The
Company currently primarily sources mid-priced women s semi-formal apparel, which the company believes potentially has a higher
gross profit margin compared to low-priced apparel. Inventory is presently selected at the discretion of our sole officer and director,
and based upon recommendations from the suppliers regarding the latest fashion trends and styles, as well as what types of clothing are
currently the most sought after by consumers. The Company also performs internal analysis to compare the profit margins of various types
of clothing and, accordingly, seeks to primarily acquire inventory that has the greatest profit margin. 

At
present, when identifying potential customers, the Company targets small size apparel retailers, especially home-based e-commerce retailers.
In the opinion of the Company s sole officer and director, this market is easier to penetrate as our officer and director believes
that many small size apparel retailers are just side or part time businesses for the business owner. As such, the business owners might
face the problem of lack of capacity to arrange the logistics and filter the correct apparel in term of trend and quality. 

The
Company adopts what is commonly referred to as a virtual network business structure, as the Company only maintains internal procurement,
sales, marketing, operational, accounting and finance functions, whereby the Company relies on suppliers for other crucial function such
as production and packaging, storage, courier inward and outward, etc. However, in some instances the Company does take physical possession
of inventory. In most cases, the Company purchases inventory from the suppliers, and this inventory is then held at the supplier s
warehouse, although the product is owned by the Company at this time, and delivery from the warehouse is arranged by the Company through
a courier service. In some instances, the Company will take possession of the inventory and store apparel at the Company s office,
and from that point courier service to the purchaser is arranged. There is no formal method of determination as to what items will be
stored in the supplier s warehouse versus what items will be stored at the Company s office. 

Sales
and Marketing 

KEEMO
Fashion Group Limited plans to penetrate the marketplace and attract customers by building our brand image through print ads, and possibly
online paid advertisements, to create brand awareness. We have prepared our corporate website (https://keemofashiongroup.wixsite.com/keemo-fashion-group)
to market our Company and we utilize search engine marketing to improve the number of distributors who can find and view our website.
Finally, we also have yet unidentified plans to market our Company through social networking websites. All the above marketing plans
have not yet been determined in sufficient detail to outline at this time, nor do we have a definitive timeline for when our marketing
strategy will be completed, and as such all of our marketing endeavors remain under development. 

Employees
and Function 

Currently,
we have one employee which is our President and Sole Director, Ms. Liu Lu. Currently, Ms. Liu has the flexibility to work on our business
up to 30 hours per week but is prepared to devote more time if necessary. The Company intends to hire more employees who possess industry-related
experience to assist in the development and execution of our business operations. 

We
do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt
plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our employee, Officer and/or Director. 

5 

Competition 

KEEMO
Fashion Group Limited plans to operate in a mature and competitive industry. We consider our focus to be on distributors in China first.
Competition in the apparel and garment industry, with a focus on low to mid-range priced products, is very intense in China. We face
competition from various specialized and retail-based wholesalers, from different provinces and cities, which supply similar men s
and women s apparel and garment products to those that we offer. We also face competition from e-commerce-based wholesalers, many
of whom have exposure in various China whole websites and B2B platform, such as Alibaba, DHgate, AliExpress, and Global Sources. These
competitors generate significant traffic and have established brand recognition and financial resources manufacturing capacity, well
established business models and distribution channels and branding. 

Despite
intense competition, our director is confident in the Company s ability to develop and enlarge our market share in China through,
at present, the various relationships of the Company s sole Officer and Director. 

Enforcement
of Civil Liabilities under United States Federal Securities Laws 

We
are a Nevada corporation and most of our operations are and will be located outside of the United States and our sole officer and director
resides outside the United States. Moreover, a majority of our assets are located outside the United States. Since a majority of the
assets owned by us are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against us may not be collectible
within the United States. There is no treaty between the United States and China providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments in civil and commercial matters and a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in
the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the federal securities laws, would, therefore, not
be automatically enforceable in China. Under the PRC Civil Procedures Law, foreign shareholders may originate actions based on PRC law
against us in the PRC, if they can establish sufficient nexus to the PRC for a PRC court to have jurisdiction, and meet other procedural
requirements, including, among others, the plaintiff must have a direct interest in the case, and there must be a concrete claim, a factual
basis and a cause for the suit. 

There
is uncertainty as to whether the courts of China would (1) recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us
or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state
in the United States, or (2) entertain original actions brought in each respective jurisdiction against us or our directors or officers
predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. 

The
recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce
foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between China and the
country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other form
of reciprocity with the United States that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. In addition,
according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in China will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers
if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security or public interest. As a
result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States. Under
the PRC Civil Procedures Law, foreign shareholders may originate actions based on PRC law against us in the PRC, if they can establish
sufficient nexus to the PRC for a PRC court to have jurisdiction, and meet other procedural requirements, including, among others, the
plaintiff must have a direct interest in the case, and there must be a concrete claim, a factual basis and a cause for the suit. 

In
addition, it will be difficult for U.S. shareholders to originate actions against us in China in accordance with PRC laws because we
are incorporated under the laws of State of Nevada and it will be difficult for U.S. shareholders, holding our common stock, to establish
a connection to China for a PRC court to have jurisdiction as required under the PRC Civil Procedures Law.

Our
common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink under the trading symbol KMFG. 

Trading
in stocks quoted on the OTC Pink is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may
have little to do with a company s operations or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there will be any liquidity for
our common stock in the future.

The

and telephone number is +1 (503) 227-2950. 

Penny
Stock Regulations 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of 1,000,000, or annual
incomes exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

Forward
Stock Split 

On
July 25, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a ten-for-one (10:1) forward stock split (the Forward Split of the Company s
common stock, par value 0.001 per share. The Company filed a Certificate of Amendment and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the
 Certificate of Amendment to effect the forward stock split with the Secretary of State of Nevada on August 2, 2024. The
Forward Split became effective on August 8, 2024 and our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 9, 2024. Concurrently
with the effectiveness of the split, the issued and outstanding shares of common stock increased from 5,500,000 to 55,000,000, which
is proportional to the ratio of the split. Neither the split nor the increase in authorized shares affected any stockholder s ownership
percentage of our common stock, altered the par value of our common stock or modified any voting rights or other terms of the common
stock. 

Dividends 

Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our
board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no contractual obligations or restrictions to declare
or pay dividends on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our board of directors
currently intends to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The

Some of the information contained in this management s discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including

Overview 

We,
KEEMO Fashion Group Limited, a Nevada corporation the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada
on April 22, 2022. 

KEEMO
Fashion Group Limited is headquartered in Shenzhen, People Republic of China (herein referred as China ). We primarily
operate in men and women apparel and garment trading business, focusing on wholesaling to distributors mainly based in Asian countries,
sourcing directly from manufacturers in China. We do not maintain and operate any production and manufacturing of apparel facility or
machine and equipment. 

The
Company s executive office is located at 69, Wanke Boyu, Xili Liuxin 1 st Rd, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518052,
China. 

Our
cash and cash equivalents are 19,421 as of July 31, 2024. Our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations
for any period of time. In order to continue our current business plan and increase our current level of operations for the next twelve-month
period, we require further funding. 

For
the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 42,275 and used cash in operating activities of 9,322 and borrowed
 29,514 from our director. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s profit generating operations in the future and/or obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due.
These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company expects to finance its operations primarily through cash flow from revenue and continuing financial support from a shareholder.
In the event that we require additional funding to finance the growth of the Company s current and expected future operations as
well as to achieve our strategic objectives, the shareholder has indicated the intent and ability to provide additional financing. 

No
assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory
to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations,
in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures ,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), means
controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the
reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded as of July 31, 2024, that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority
of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in
the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk
assessment ; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines; and (4) lack of internal audit function due to the fact that the Company lacks qualified
resources to perform the internal audit functions properly and that the scope and effectiveness of the internal audit function are yet
to be developed. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the review
of our financial statements as of July 31, 2024. 

12 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However,
management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors
results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result
in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management s review and approval
of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the Company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being
 made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing
of the operational effectiveness of these controls. 

13 

Based
on this assessment, management has concluded that as of July 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses
and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

We
will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function. We will create a position to
segregate duties consistent with control objectives. And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors
who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the
establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made
by management when funds are available to us. 

We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2025. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting: 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered independent
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Chief
 Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director 

Liu
Lu Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director 

In
2017, Ms. Liu graduated from the Sichuan University, Undergraduate Program for Specialty in Computer Science and Technology. From July
2017 to present, Ms. Liu works in the promotional department at the Tencent Interactive Entertainment Group, which is a division of Tencent
Holdings that publishes and develops video games for multiple platforms. From July 2017 to August 2017, she was responsible for three
initiatives, which are event planning, content operation, and market promotional and platform collaboration for the project Deformers ,
a PC game. Regarding event planning, she handled event execution and post-event analysis. For content operation, she handled the official
website construction, content creation, and content planning. For market promotion and platform collaboration, she handled marketing
of the game, which involved collaboration with different online and media platforms. From August 2018 until present, Ms. Liu has been
mainly responsible for the project Rocket League , which is an online game. She mainly responsible on the resource allocation,
event planning and execution, post-event analysis and the user operation. Ms. Liu s position at Tencent Holdings is a full-time
job, to which she devotes approximately 45 hours per week. 

In
April 2022, Ms. Liu founded KEEMO Fashion Group Limited, and as a result of her promotional, organizational, and marketing experience,
it is the determination of the board that she serves as our Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director. 

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications
made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally
adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers and Directors as the Company
is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company review the Company s internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees
of the Board 

Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Director(s) believe that it is not necessary to have
such committees, at this time, because the Directors can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

15 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term
is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14)
of the FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because
management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that
retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our
Directors and our Officers have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 bankruptcy
 petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
 bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any
 conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
 offenses); 
 
 3. 
 being
 subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
 permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities
 or banking activities; or 
 
 4. 
 being
 found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have
 violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 
 
 5. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State
 securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended,
 or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated
 any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not
 been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not
 subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of: (i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities
 law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited
 to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist
 order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with
 any business entity; or 
 
 8. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory
 organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section
 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that
 has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence
of Directors 

We
are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such
time as we are required to do so. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our Sole Officer
and Director, Liu Lu, at the address appearing on the first page of this Registration Statement.

SECTION
16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10 of our common stock,
to file reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, our securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide
us with copies of those filings. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written representations by
our officers and directors regarding their compliance with applicable reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements for our executive officers, directors and 10 stockholders were met during the
year ended July 31, 2024.

Compensation
Discussion and Analysis 

Director
Compensation 

Our
Board of Directors does not currently receive any consideration for their services as members of the Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors reserves the right in the future to award the members of the Board of Directors cash or stock-based consideration for their
services to the Company, which awards, if granted shall be in the sole determination of the Board of Directors. 

Executive
Compensation Philosophy 

Our
Board of Directors determines the compensation given to our executive officers in their sole determination. Our Board of Directors reserves
the right to pay our executive or any future executives a salary, and/or issue them shares of common stock in consideration for services
rendered and/or to award incentive bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive officer s
performance. This package may also include long-term stock-based compensation to certain executives, which is intended to align the performance
of our executives with our long-term business strategies. Additionally, while our Board of Directors has not granted any performance
base stock options to date, the Board of Directors reserves the right to grant such options in the future, if the Board in its sole determination
believes such grants would be in the best interests of the Company. 

Incentive
Bonus 

The
Board of Directors may grant incentive bonuses to our executive officer and/or future executive officers in its sole discretion, if the
Board of Directors believes such bonuses are in the Company s best interest, after analyzing our current business objectives and
growth, if any, and the amount of revenue we are able to generate each month, which revenue is a direct result of the actions and ability
of such executives. 

Long-term,
Stock Based Compensation 

In
order to attract, retain and motivate executive talent necessary to support the Company s long-term business strategy we may award
our executive and any future executives with long-term, stock-based compensation in the future, at the sole discretion of our Board of
Directors, which we do not currently have any immediate plans to award.

On
August 8, 2024, a ten-for-one (10:1) forward stock split of the Company s common stock became effective, which increased the number
of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the beneficial owner increased from 3,600,000 to 36,000,000, consistent with the split
ratio. Neither the split nor the increase in authorized shares affected any stockholder s ownership percentage of our common stock. 

Beneficial
ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to
be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares).
In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon
exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership
of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition
rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect
the person s actual voting power at any particular date.

902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant to offshore transactions, and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States
by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing.

Review,
Approval and Ratification of Related Party Transactions 

Given
our small size and limited financial resources, we have not adopted formal policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification
of transactions, such as those described above, with our executive officer(s), Director(s) and significant stockholders. We intend to
establish formal policies and procedures in the future, once we have sufficient resources and have appointed additional Directors, so
that such transactions will be subject to the review, approval or ratification of our Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee
thereof. On a moving forward basis, our Directors will continue to approve any related party transaction.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, for the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company s losses from operations, accumulated deficit, net
current liabilities, and negative operating cash flows raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current year audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to those charged with governance that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there are no critical matters.

In
accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC, the Company s chief operating decision maker has been identified
as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing
performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements
to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers,
and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation
under Segment Reporting due to their similar customer base and similarities in economic characteristics; nature of products
and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes.
