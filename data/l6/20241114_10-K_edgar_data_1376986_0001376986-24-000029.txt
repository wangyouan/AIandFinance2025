 FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 contains forward-looking statements relating to future events and future performance. All statements other than those that are purely historical may be forward-looking statements. In certain cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "intend," "project," "plan," "predict," "assume," "forecast," "estimate," "objective," "possible," "probably," "likely," "potential," "speculate," "aim," "aspiration," "goal," "seek," "strategy," "target," the negative of such words, or other similar expressions. 
 
 Although the Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") believes that the assumptions underlying any forward-looking statements are reasonable, TVA does not guarantee the accuracy of these statements. Numerous factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things: 
 
 Significant additional costs for TVA to manage and operate its coal combustion residuals ("CCR") facilities; 
 The cost of complying with known, anticipated, or new environmental requirements, some of which could render continued operation of many of TVA's aging coal-fired generation units not cost-effective or result in their removal from service, perhaps permanently; 
 Federal legislation aimed specifically at curtailing TVA's activities, including legislation that may require the divestiture of TVA or the sale of certain of TVA's assets; restrict access to its U.S. Treasury account; eliminate its sole authority to set rates; restrict its authority to manage the Tennessee River system; lower the debt ceiling on bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness (collectively, "Bonds") specified in the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, as amended ("TVA Act"); or limit its ability to pay its Chief Executive Officer or other employees competitive salaries; 
 New, existing, or amended laws, regulations, executive orders ("EOs"), or administrative order or interpretations, including those related to climate change and other environmental matters, and the costs of complying with these laws, regulations, EOs, or administrative orders or interpretations; 
 Loss of TVA's protected service territory if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") were to limit the application of the anti-cherrypicking provision, or if Congress were to eliminate the anti-cherrypicking provision, without corresponding legislative modifications to the territorial limitations imposed by the fence; 
 Additional federal reliability standards set forth by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation ("NERC") and approved by FERC and the costs of complying with these new standards; 
 The failure of TVA's generation, transmission, navigation, flood control, and related assets and infrastructure, including CCR facilities, dams, and spent nuclear fuel storage facilities, to operate as anticipated, resulting in health, safety, or environmental problems, lost revenues, damages, or other costs that are not reflected in TVA's financial statements or projections, including due to aging, technological issues, or extreme weather conditions; 
 Significant delays and additional costs, and/or inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, licenses, or permits, for major projects, including for assets that TVA needs to serve its existing and future load and to meet its carbon reduction aspirations; 
 Risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities or other generation and related facilities, including CCR facilities and dams; 
 Events at a nuclear facility, whether or not operated by or licensed to TVA, which, among other things, could lead to increased regulation or restriction on the construction, ownership, operation, or decommissioning of nuclear facilities or on the storage of spent fuel, obligate TVA to pay retrospective insurance premiums, reduce the availability and affordability of insurance, increase the costs of operating TVA's existing nuclear units, or cause TVA to forego future construction at these or other facilities; 
 The inaccuracy of certain assumptions about the future, including economic forecasts, anticipated energy and commodity prices, cost estimates, construction schedules, power demand forecasts, potential regulatory environments, and the appropriate generation mix to meet demand; 
 Circumstances that cause TVA to change its determinations regarding the appropriate mix of generation assets; 
 Inability to continue to operate certain assets, especially nuclear facilities, including due to the inability to obtain, or loss of, regulatory approval for the operation of assets; 
 Physical attacks, threats, or other interference causing damage to TVA's facilities or interfering with TVA's operations; 
 Other unforeseeable occurrences negatively impacting TVA assets or their supporting infrastructure; 
 Events at TVA facilities, which, among other things, could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, damage to or loss of the facility, or damage to the property of others; 
 Events that negatively impact TVA's reliability, including problems at other utilities or at TVA facilities or the increase in intermittent sources of power; 
 Disruption of supplies of fuel, purchased power, or other critical items or services, which may result from, among other things, economic conditions, weather conditions, physical or cyber attacks, political developments, international trade restrictions or tariffs, legal actions, mine closures or reduced mine production, increases in fuel exports, environmental regulations affecting TVA's suppliers, transportation or delivery constraints, shortages of raw materials, supply chain difficulties, labor shortages, force majeure events, forced outages, intentional defaults, strikes, inflation, or similar events and which may, among other things, hinder TVA's ability to operate its assets, to complete projects on time and on budget, and meet its contractual obligations to deliver power; 
 Global conflicts, terrorist activities, or military actions by the United States ("U.S.") government and its allies; 
 6 

Table of Contents

 The failure of TVA's information technology systems; 
 Lower future demand for electricity than TVA currently expects or is financially planning for, which would lead to unexpected revenue constraints that could negatively impact TVA's ability to meet financial obligations, including those associated with financing of projects to meet the anticipated demand; 
 The need for significant future contributions associated with TVA's pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans, or health care plans; 
 Limitations on TVA's ability to borrow money, which may result from, among other things, TVA's approaching or substantially reaching the debt ceiling or TVA's losing access to the debt markets, and which may impact TVA's ability to make planned capital investments; 
 Downgrades of TVA's credit ratings or the United States' sovereign credit ratings which may negatively impact TVA and the owners of TVA securities; 
 Changes in technology, which, among other things, may affect relationships with customers and require TVA to change how it conducts its operations;

 Changes in the market price of commodities such as purchased power, coal, uranium, natural gas, fuel oil, crude oil, construction materials, reagents, or emission allowances; 
 A limitation on the market for TVA Bonds, which may be influenced by the fact that the payment of principal and interest on TVA securities is not guaranteed by the U.S. government; 
 Failure to attract or retain an appropriately qualified, diverse, and inclusive workforce; 
 Changes in the membership of the TVA Board of Directors ("TVA Board") or TVA senior management, which may impact how TVA operates; 
 Loss of quorum of the TVA Board, which may limit TVA's ability to adapt to meet changing business conditions; 
 Weather conditions, including changing weather patterns, extreme weather conditions, and other events such as flooding, droughts, wildfires, heat waves, and snow or ice storms that may result from climate change, which may hamper TVA's ability to supply power, cause customers' demand for power to exceed TVA's then-present power supply, pose health, safety, or environmental risks, or otherwise negatively impact TVA's operations or financial condition; 
 Events affecting the supply or quality of water from the Tennessee River system or Cumberland River system, or elsewhere, which could interfere with TVA's ability to generate power; 
 Catastrophic events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, solar events, electromagnetic pulses, geomagnetic disturbances, droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, polar vortexes, icing events, pipeline explosions, or other casualty events, wars, national emergencies, terrorist activities, pandemics, widespread public health crises, geopolitical events, or other similar destructive or disruptive events; 
 Ineffectiveness of TVA's financial control system to control issues and instances of fraud or to prevent or detect errors; 
 Inability to use regulatory accounting for certain costs; 
 Inability of TVA to implement its business strategy successfully, including due to the increased use in the public of distributed energy resources or energy-efficiency programs; 
 Inability of TVA to achieve or maintain its cost reduction goals, which may require TVA to increase rates and/or issue more debt than planned; 
 Failure of TVA s organizational structure to adequately support TVA s anticipated business needs or enable it to meet the needs of its current or potential customers; 
 Inability of TVA to adapt its business model to changes in the utility industry and customer preferences and to remain cost competitive;

TVA acquires personal property in the name of TVA. Accordingly, unless the context indicates the reference is to TVA's personal property, any statement in this Annual Report referring to TVA property shall be read as referring to the real property of the U.S. that has been entrusted to TVA as its agent. 
 
 Available Information 
 
 TVA files annual, quarterly, and current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under Section 37 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). TVA's SEC filings are available to the public at www.tva.com, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Information contained on or accessible through TVA's website shall not be deemed to be incorporated into, or to be a part of, this Annual Report or any other report or document that TVA files with the SEC.

 PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

The Corporation 
 
 General 
 
 The Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") is a corporate agency and instrumentality of the United States ("U.S.") that was created in 1933 by federal legislation in response to a proposal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. TVA was created to, among other things, improve navigation on the Tennessee River, reduce the damage from destructive flood waters within the Tennessee River system and downstream on the lower Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, further the economic development of TVA's service area in the southeastern U.S., and sell the electricity generated at the facilities TVA operates. Today, TVA operates the nation's largest public power system and supplies power to a population of approximately million people. 
 
 TVA also manages the Tennessee River, its tributaries, and certain shorelines to provide, among other things, year-round navigation, flood damage reduction, and affordable and reliable electricity. Consistent with these primary purposes, TVA also manages the river system and public lands to provide recreational opportunities, adequate water supply, improved water quality, cultural and natural resource protection, and economic development. TVA performs these management duties in cooperation with other federal and state agencies that have jurisdiction and authority over certain aspects of the river system. In addition, the TVA Board of Directors ("TVA Board") has established two councils the Regional Resource Stewardship Council and the Regional Energy Resource Council to advise TVA on its stewardship activities in the Tennessee Valley and its energy resource activities. 
 
 Initially, all TVA operations were funded by federal appropriations. Direct appropriations for the TVA power program ended in 1959, and appropriations for TVA's stewardship, economic development, and multipurpose activities ended in 1999. Since 1999, TVA has funded all of its operations almost entirely from the sale of electricity and power system financings. TVA's power system financings consist primarily of the sale of bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness (collectively, "Bonds") and secondarily of alternative forms of financing, such as lease arrangements. As a wholly-owned government corporation, TVA is not authorized to issue equity securities. 
 
 TVA's Mission of Service 
 
 TVA was built for the people, created by federal legislation, and charged with a unique mission - to improve the quality of life in a seven-state region through the integrated management of the region's resources. TVA's mission focuses on three key areas: 
 
 Energy Delivering reliable, low cost, clean energy; 
 
 Environment Caring for the region's natural resources; and 
 
 Economic Development Creating sustainable economic growth. 
 
 TVA's Strategic Priorities 
 
 While TVA's mission has not changed since it was established in 1933, the climate in which TVA operates continues to evolve. To continue to deliver its mission of service while evolving for future success, TVA must realize five strategic priorities: 
 
 People Advantage Amplifying the energy, passion, and creativity within each TVA employee; 
 
 Operational Excellence Building on TVA's best-in-class reputation for reliable service and competitively priced power; 
 
 Financial Strength Investing in the future, while keeping energy costs as low as possible; 
 
 Powerful Partnerships Promoting progress through the shared success of TVA's customers and stakeholders; and 
 
 Igniting Innovation Pursuing innovative solutions for TVA and its customers and communities.

 Service Area 
 
 TVA's service area, the area in which it sells power, is defined by the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, as amended ("TVA Act"). TVA supplies power in most of Tennessee, northern Alabama, northeastern Mississippi, and southwestern Kentucky, and in portions of northern Georgia, western North Carolina, and southwestern Virginia. Under the TVA Act, subject to certain minor exceptions, TVA may not, without the enactment of authorizing federal legislation, enter into contracts that would have the effect of making it, or the wholesale customers that distribute TVA power ("local power company customers" or "LPCs"), a source of power supply outside the area for which TVA or its LPCs were the primary source of power supply on July 1, 1957. This provision is referred to as the "fence" because it bounds TVA's sales activities, essentially limiting TVA to power sales within a defined service area. 

Note 
 (1) TVA Locations shown here are in service as of September 30, 2024 . 
 (2) In addition to the locations above, TVA owns approximately one megawatt ("MW") of nameplate capacity among nine operating solar installations across the Tennessee Valley region with six installations in Tennessee, two in Alabama, and one in Mississippi. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources for a description of all of TVA's power supply resources. 
 
 In addition, the Federal Power Act ("FPA") includes a provision that helps protect TVA's ability to sell power within its service area. This provision, called the "anti-cherrypicking" provision, prevents the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") from ordering TVA to provide access to its transmission lines to others to deliver power to customers within TVA's defined service area. As a result, the anti-cherrypicking provision reduces TVA's exposure to loss of its customers. However, there have been some efforts to circumvent the anti-cherrypicking provision, and the protection of the provision could be limited and perhaps eliminated by federal legislation at some time in the future. See Competition and Item 1A, Risk Factors Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks TVA could lose its protected service territory. 
 
 In 2024, the revenues generated from TVA's electricity sales were 12.1 billion and accounted for virtually all of TVA's revenues. See Note 17 Revenue for details regarding revenues by state for each of the last three years.

 Customers 
 
 TVA is primarily a wholesaler of power, selling power to LPCs that then resell power to their customers at retail rates. TVA's LPCs consist of (1) municipalities and other local government entities ("municipalities") and (2) customer-owned entities ("cooperatives"). These municipalities and cooperatives operate public power electric systems whose primary purpose is not to make a profit but to supply electricity to the general public or the cooperatives' members. TVA also sells power directly to certain end-use customers, primarily large commercial and industrial loads and federal agencies with loads larger than 5,000 kilowatts. Whether TVA or an LPC serves a new power customer is determined by the applicable TVA-LPC wholesale power contract. Each contract contains a formula that balances the size of the LPC and the amount of any TVA infrastructure investment to determine which party is entitled to serve the new customer. In addition, power in excess of the needs of the TVA system may, where consistent with the provisions of the TVA Act, be sold under exchange power arrangements with other specific electric systems. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Financial Results Operating Revenues and Note 17 Revenue for details regarding TVA's operating revenues. 
 
 Local Power Company Customers 
 
 Revenues from LPCs accounted for approximately 90 percent of TVA's total operating revenues for 2024. TVA had wholesale power contracts with 153 LPCs at September 30, 2024. Each of these contracts requires the LPC to purchase from TVA all of the electric power required for service to the LPC's customers; however, Power Supply Flexibility Agreements available to LPCs that have executed long-term Partnership Agreements with TVA allow LPCs to locally generate or purchase up to approximately five percent of their average total hourly energy sales over a certain time period in order to meet their individual customers' needs. Revised flexibility agreements were made available to LPCs in August 2023. These revised agreements permit projects to be located anywhere in TVA's service area, connected either to the LPC distribution system or to TVA's transmission system, and make it easier for LPCs to partner on projects. As of September 30, 2024, 102 LPCs had signed a Power Supply Flexibility Agreement. LPCs purchase power under contracts with terms of five or 20 years to terminate. 
 
 TVA's two largest LPCs Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division ("MLGW") and Nashville Electric Service ("NES") have contracts with a five-year and a 20-year termination notice period, respectively. Sales to MLGW and NES accounted for nine percent and eight percent, respectively, of TVA's total operating revenues for 2024. 
 
 TVA and LPCs continue to work together to meet the changing needs of consumers around the Tennessee Valley. TVA has a Partnership Agreement option that better aligns the length of LPC power contracts with TVA's long-term commitments. Under the partnership arrangement, the LPC power contracts automatically renew each year and have a 20-year termination notice. The partnership arrangements can be terminated under certain circumstances, including TVA's failure to limit rate increases to no more than 10 percent during any consecutive five-fiscal-year period, as more specifically described in the agreements. Participating LPCs receive benefits including a 3.1 percent wholesale bill credit in exchange for their long-term commitment, which enables TVA to recover its long-term financial commitments over a commensurate period. As of September 30, 2024, 148 LPCs had signed the Partnership Agreement with TVA. 
 
 The power contracts between TVA and LPCs provide for the purchase of power by LPCs at the wholesale rates established by the TVA Board. Under the TVA Act, the TVA Board is authorized to regulate LPCs to carry out the purposes of the TVA Act through contract terms and conditions as well as through rules and regulations. TVA regulates LPCs primarily through the provisions of TVA's wholesale power contracts. All of the power contracts between TVA and the LPCs require that power purchased from TVA be sold and distributed to the ultimate consumer without discrimination among consumers of the same class and prohibit direct or indirect discriminatory rates, rebates, or other special concessions. In addition, there are a number of wholesale power contract provisions through which TVA seeks to ensure that the electric system revenues of the LPCs are used only for electric system purposes. Furthermore, almost all of these contracts specify the resale rates and charges at which the LPC must resell TVA power to its customers. These rates are revised from time to time, subject to TVA approval, to reflect changes in costs, including changes in the wholesale cost of power. 
 
 TVA also regulates LPC policies for customer deposits, termination of service for non-payment, providing information to consumers, and billing through a service practice policy framework. TVA's regulatory framework provides for consistent regulatory policy for ratepayers across the Tennessee Valley, while recognizing local considerations. The regulatory provisions in TVA's wholesale power contracts are designed to carry out the objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective of providing for an adequate supply of power at the lowest feasible rates. See Rates Rate Methodology below. 
 
 Other Customers 
 
 Revenues from directly served industrial customers accounted for approximately seven percent of TVA's total operating revenues in 2024. Contracts with these customers are subject to termination by the customer or TVA upon a minimum notice period that varies according to a number of factors, including the customer's contract demand and the period of time service has been provided. TVA also serves seven federal customers, including U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") facilities and military installations, which accounted for approximately one percent of TVA's total operating revenues in 2024.

Table of Contents 

 Other Revenue 
 
 Other revenue consists primarily of wheeling and network transmission charges, sales of excess steam that is a by-product of power production, delivery point charges for interconnection points between TVA and the customer, Renewable Energy Certificate ("REC") sales, and certain other ancillary goods or services. Other revenue accounted for approximately two percent of TVA's total operating revenues in 2024. 

Rates 
 
 Rate Authority 
 
 The TVA Act gives the TVA Board sole responsibility for establishing the rates TVA charges for power. These rates are not subject to judicial review or to review or approval by any state or other federal regulatory body. Under the TVA Act, TVA is required to charge rates for power that will produce gross revenues sufficient to provide funds for: 
 
 Operation, maintenance, and administration of its power system; 
 Payments to states and counties in lieu of taxes ("tax equivalents"); 
 Debt service on outstanding indebtedness; 
 Payments to the United States Department of the Treasury ("U.S. Treasury") in repayment of and as a return on the government's appropriation investment in TVA's power facilities (the "Power Program Appropriation Investment"); and 
 Such additional margin as the TVA Board may consider desirable for investment in power system assets, retirement of outstanding Bonds in advance of their maturity, additional reduction of the Power Program Appropriation Investment, and other purposes connected with TVA's power business, having due regard for the primary objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective that power shall be sold at rates as low as are feasible. See Note 23 Related Parties . 
 
 TVA fulfilled its requirement to repay 1.0 billion of the Power Program Appropriation Investment in 2014; therefore, the 
 repayment of this amount is no longer a component of rate setting. 
 
 Rate Methodology 
 
 TVA uses a seasonal time of use wholesale rate structure comprised of base demand and energy rates, a fuel rate, and a grid access charge ("GAC") . In setting the base rates, TVA uses a debt-service coverage methodology to derive annual revenue requirements in a manner similar to that used by other public power entities that also use the debt-service coverage rate methodology. Under the debt-service coverage methodology, rates are calculated so that an entity will be able to cover its operating costs and to satisfy its obligations to pay principal and interest on debt, plus an additional margin. This ratemaking approach is particularly suitable for use by entities financed primarily, if not entirely, by debt, such as TVA, and helps ensure that TVA produces gross revenues sufficient to fund requirements specified in the TVA Act listed under Rate Authority above. TVA's rate structure includes a focus on TVA's long-term pricing by aligning rates with underlying cost drivers. 
 
 TVA recovers fuel costs and tax equivalent payments associated with fuel cost adjustments through a monthly rate reflecting the forecasted costs of fuel. Fuel costs are allocated to three groups of customers: (1) Standard Service (residential and small commercial customers), (2) large general service customers with contract demands greater than 5 MW, and (3) large manufacturing customers with contract demands greater than 5 MW. Fuel costs are allocated to these three classes of customers in relation to their hourly loads and TVA's hourly incremental dispatch cost. Total monthly fuel costs include costs for natural gas, fuel oil, coal, purchased power, emission allowances, nuclear fuel, and other fuel-related commodities as well as realized gains and losses on derivatives purchased to hedge the costs of such commodities. 

Power Supply and Load Management Resources 
 
 General 
 
 TVA seeks to balance production capabilities with power supply requirements by promoting the conservation and efficient use of electricity and, when necessary, buying, building, or leasing assets or entering into power purchase agreements ("PPAs"). TVA also seeks to employ a diverse mix of energy generating sources and works toward obtaining greater amounts of its power supply from clean (low or zero carbon-emitting) resources. Currently, TVA is working with stakeholders and the public on the 2025 Integrated Resource Plan ("IRP"), a comprehensive plan that will help shape TVA's energy system through 2050. The IRP is expected to be TVA s compass for power generation decisions as well as for long-term operational and financial planning. 
 
 TVA is making investments in its generating portfolio and infrastructure to both help meet the growing demand for electricity and modernize the fleet while also allowing TVA to maintain competitive rates and high reliability and work toward an increasingly clean power system. As TVA continues to evaluate the impact of retiring its coal-fired fleet by 2035 and works to accelerate the growth of renewables, it also continues to evaluate adding flexible lower carbon-emitting gas plants as a strategy 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 to maintain reliability. Commercial operations began on Paradise Combustion Turbine Units ("CTs") 5-7 on December 29, 2023. TVA also has ongoing natural gas projects at its Johnsonville, Cumberland, and Kingston sites and is evaluating natural gas projects for the replacement generation for the second unit at Cumberland, a new Caledonia CT plant on TVA land, and an aeroderivative CT project at TVA's Allen site. TVA is committed to investing in the future of nuclear with the evaluation of emerging advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors ("SMRs"), while also investing in its existing nuclear assets and working to renew its nuclear generation fleet licenses. TVA has been implementing the Hydro Life Extension Program with a focus on improving the availability and flexibility of the hydroelectric fleet and exploring new hydroelectric pumped-storage power to support the grid. It is also investing in research and development for technology around hydrogen fuel and carbon capture, utilization, and storage. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("Inflation Reduction Act") makes certain tax-exempt entities, including TVA, eligible for a direct-pay option for certain tax credits that encourage investment in clean energy, in some circumstances. TVA is currently exploring funding opportunities of various types, including opportunities involving pumped-storage, solar, carbon capture, hydrogen, energy efficiency, and transmission, among others; however, this exploration does not guarantee that TVA or its partners will receive funds. See Research and Development below, Item 1A, Risk Factors Operational Risks , and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio. 
 
 Power generating facilities operated by TVA at September 30, 2024, included three nuclear sites, 18 natural gas and/or oil-fired sites, four coal-fired sites, 29 conventional hydroelectric sites, one pumped-storage hydroelectric site, one diesel generator site, and nine operating solar installations. See Item 2, Properties Generating Properties Net Capability for a discussion of the units at these facilities. TVA also acquires power under PPAs of varying durations, including short-term contracts of less than 24-hours in duration. See Power Purchase and Other Agreements below. 
 
 The following table shows TVA's generation and purchased power by generating source as a percentage of all electric power generated and purchased (based on kilowatt hours ("kWh")) for the periods indicated: 
 
 Total Power Supply by Generating Source 
 For the years ended September 30

 Note 
 (1) TVA's non-hydro renewable resources from TVA facilities are less than one percent for all periods shown, and therefore are not represented on the table above. Purchased power contains the majority of non-hydro renewable energy supply. TVA acquires RECs in connection with certain purchased power transactions and sells some of these RECs to customers. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio Renewable Power Purchase Agreements. 
 
 While TVA continues down the path of lowering emissions, including GHG emissions, there will be fluctuations in usage due to electricity demands. Also, TVA continues to make operational decisions to keep the system reliable and to deliver low-cost energy . 
 
 Nuclear 
 
 At September 30, 2024, TVA had three nuclear sites consisting of seven units in operation. The units at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant ("Browns Ferry") are boiling water reactor units, and the units at Sequoyah Nuclear Plant ("Sequoyah") and Watts Bar Nuclear Plant ("Watts Bar") are pressurized water reactor units. Operating information for each of these units is included in the table below.

Table of Contents 

Nuclear Fleet License Extensions . TVA is seeking to renew all nuclear generation units' licenses for an additional 20 years. The first license renewal application was submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") in January 2024 for the three units at Browns Ferry. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio Nuclear Fleet License Extensions. 
 
 Other Nuclear Initiatives . TVA has an Early Site Permit to potentially construct and operate SMRs at TVA's Clinch River Nuclear Site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and in 2022, the TVA Board approved a programmatic approach to exploring advanced nuclear technology (the "New Nuclear Program"). See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio Small Modular Reactors . 
 
 Other Nuclear Matters. Operating nuclear facilities subjects TVA to waste disposal, decommissioning, and insurance requirements, as well as litigation risks. See Fuel Supply Nuclear Fuel below for a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and low-level radioactive waste and Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies for a discussion of TVA's nuclear decommissioning liabilities and the related trust and nuclear insurance, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference. TVA's Sequoyah Unit 2 tripped on July 30, 2024, due to failure of the main generator. As a result, the project to restack and rewind the main generator was pulled forward in the Nuclear Life Extension ("NLE") plan. The unit will remain offline until project completion, which is expected in spring 2025. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Unit 2 . 
 
 Natural Gas and/or Oil-Fired 
 
 At September 30, 2024, TVA's natural gas and oil-fired fleet consisted of 85 combustion turbine power blocks (68 simple-cycle units, one cogeneration unit, and 14 combined-cycle power units, accounting for 12,656 MW of summer net capability, and two idled units at Allen Combustion Turbine Facility: Units 17 and 18). In 2024, Allen CTs 1-16 and Johnsonville CTs 11-16 were retired. Fifty-three of the simple-cycle units are currently capable of quick-start response allowing full generation capability in approximately 10 minutes. The economic dispatch of natural gas-fired plants depends on both the day-to-day price of natural gas and the price of other available intermediate resources such as coal-fired plants. TVA uses simple-cycle units to meet peaking or backup power needs. As TVA evaluates the retirement of its coal-fired fleet and works to accelerate the growth of renewables, it also continues to evaluate adding flexible lower carbon-emitting gas plants as a strategy to maintain reliability. The natural gas-fired fleet supports renewable expansion by providing reliability across all hours, as well as the flexibility to help manage ramping and intermittency. Commercial operations began on Paradise CTs 5-7 on December 29, 2023. TVA also has ongoing natural gas projects at its Johnsonville, Cumberland, and Kingston sites and is evaluating natural gas projects for the replacement generation for the second unit at Cumberland, a new Caledonia CT plant on TVA land, and an aeroderivative CT project at TVA's Allen site. TVA may decide to make further strategic investments in natural gas-fired facilities in the future by purchase, construction, or lease, to help support portfolio diversification and system reliability. 
 
 See Item 2, Properties Generating Properties, Note 8 Leases, and Note 14 Debt and Other Obligations for a discussion of lease arrangements into which TVA has entered in connection with certain combined cycle facilities. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio Natural Gas-Fired Units for a discussion of ongoing projects at certain natural gas-fired facilities . 
 
 Coal-Fired 
 
 At September 30, 2024, TVA had four coal-fired plants consisting of 24 active units, accounting for 5,815 MW of summer net capability. TVA considers units to be in an active state when the unit is generating, available for service, or temporarily unavailable due to equipment failures, inspections, or repairs. 
 
 Coal-fired plants have been subject to increasingly stringent regulatory requirements over the last few decades, including those under the Clean Air Act ("CAA"), the Clean Water Act ("CWA"), and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"). TVA is pursuing a programmatic approach for the evaluation of its sites where coal combustion residuals ("CCR") are stored to meet all applicable state and federal regulations. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Coal Combustion Residuals Coal Combustion Residuals Facilities. 
 
 TVA continues to work toward a balanced generation plan with greater reliance on lower-cost and cleaner energy generation technologies. Since September 30, 2010, TVA has reduced its summer net capability of coal-fired units by 8,418 MW. TVA is evaluating the impact of retiring the balance of the coal-fired fleet by 2035, and that evaluation includes environmental review, public input, and TVA Board approval. In January 2023, TVA issued its Record of Decision to retire the two coal-fired units at Cumberland by the end of calendar year ("CY") 2026 and CY 2028. In April 2024, TVA issued its Record of Decision to retire the nine coal-fired units at Kingston by CY 2027. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio .

Table of Contents 

Diesel Generators 
 
 At September 30, 2024, TVA had one diesel generator plant consisting of five units, and this facility accounted for nine 
 MW of summer net capability. These units are not currently dispatched for generation to the transmission grid. 
 
 Hydroelectric Pumped-Storage 
 
 At September 30, 2024, TVA had four units at Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant ("Raccoon Mountain") with a total net summer capability of 1,715 MW. These units are utilized to balance the transmission system as well as generate power. TVA uses electricity generated by its fleet during periods of low demand to operate pumps that fill the reservoir at Raccoon Mountain. Then, during periods of high or peak demand, the water is released and the pumps reverse to work as power generating turbines. 
 
 New hydroelectric pumped-storage is one of several technologies that TVA is exploring to ensure the reliability and resiliency of the grid, particularly as intermittent renewables like solar continue to be added to the generation mix. In 2023, TVA announced sites for a potential future pumped-storage facility. After completing an Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS"), TVA will select a site based on a wide range of environmental, social, and technical factors. Exploratory drilling is occurring. 
 
 Renewable Energy Resources 
 
 As more consumers and businesses are seeking cleaner energy, the utility industry is evolving to meet those needs. As TVA also evolves, it will see impacts to the way it does business through the pricing of products, transmission of energy, and development of new products and services for its customers in support of changing customer preferences. Many companies are focusing on sustainability and requiring more energy efficiency and renewable energy options. In addition, TVA seeks to obtain greater amounts of its power supply from clean resources to work towards carbon emission reductions. As a result, TVA is working to increase its renewable energy portfolio by investing in existing hydroelectric assets through the Hydro Life Extension Program, securing renewable PPAs, and exploring Self-Directed Solar projects. TVA also encourages renewable power and offers renewable resources through various current programs and offerings, including the Green Invest Program, which matches customer demand with renewable supply and is designed to meet the needs of customers at scale. See Power Purchase and Other Agreements for information on TVA s PPAs, including renewable agreements, and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio Renewable Power Purchase Agreements for a discussion of TVA's RFPs. 
 
 Conventional Hydroelectric Dams. At September 30, 2024, TVA's hydroelectric fleet consisted of 29 conventional hydroelectric dams throughout the Tennessee River system with 109 conventional hydroelectric units (106 active units and three units in long-term outage and unavailable for service), that accounted for 3,757 MW of summer net capability. Wilbur Hydroelectric Facility Units 1-3 were in long-term outage and unavailable for service at September 30, 2024. The amount of electricity that TVA is able to generate from its hydroelectric plants depends on a number of factors, including the amount of precipitation and runoff, initial water levels, generating unit availability, and the need for water for competing water management objectives. When these factors are unfavorable, TVA must increase its reliance on higher cost generation plants and purchased power. In addition, TVA receives a portion of energy generated by eight of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("USACE") dams on the Cumberland River system, and electric generation from the USACE dams is dependent on the same factors that affect generation from the TVA-owned dams . See Dam Safety Assurance Program and Weather and Seasonality below. 
 
 Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2 has a unique reversible turbine/generator that acts as a pump and a turbine enhancing TVA's ability to balance baseload generation. At September 30, 2024, Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2 accounted for 86 MW of the conventional hydroelectric summer net capability. 
 
 TVA has a Hydro Life Extension Program which focuses on recovering and preserving TVA's extensive hydroelectric fleet, improving efficiency and flexibility, and ensuring long-term reliability of this vital clean energy asset. As part of this program, TVA is working to add additional carbon free capacity to some of its existing hydroelectric units. In a separate effort, TVA is working to improve transmission system reliability by upgrading or adding synchronous condensing capability to several of the conventional hydro units in the fleet. Hydroelectric generation is an important part of TVA's energy mix in the future. It plays a vital role in carbon reduction initiatives, the ability to integrate other renewables into the power portfolio, and TVA's ability to meet changing customer preferences for cleaner energy sources. 
 
 In 2023, TVA signed a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") with the DOE to enhance collaboration on hydropower technology development. Joint efforts are focusing on evaluating and demonstrating different approaches for operating hydropower plants to meet the electricity grid's changing needs. 
 
 Dam Safety Assurance Program. TVA has an established dam safety program, which includes procedures based on the Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety, with the objective of reducing the risk of a dam safety event. The program analyzes, evaluates, and manages risks through a systematic and thorough process that facilitates decision-making for the safety of a structure, identifying necessary actions to reduce risk, including remediation projects, and prioritization of actions for TVA's river 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 dams. Prioritization is driven by reducing risk to the public and asset preservation. TVA also continues to provide routine care of the dams as part of the dam safety program through inspections, monitoring, and maintenance, among other activities. 
 
 Self-Directed Solar. During 2019, the TVA Board approved the opportunity for TVA to explore being directly involved in the development of a utility-scale solar project, contingent on the successful completion of environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA") and other applicable laws. In 2021, TVA purchased land for this development, and in 2022, environmental reviews were completed. The challenges affecting the U.S. solar industry are also being seen in TVA's Self-Directed Solar project. The project has experienced delays and cost increases due to escalations from supply chain limitations. TVA has elected to pursue a competitive selection process with third parties for the development of the photovoltaic ("PV") solar facility to be located on the site. TVA plans to enter into a long-term PPA to purchase the energy generated by the facility. An RFP has been issued to this effect, and selection of the awardee is anticipated in early CY 2025. 
 
 In November 2022, the TVA Board approved the opportunity for TVA to explore the development of an additional utility-scale solar project, contingent on successfully completing environmental reviews under NEPA and other applicable laws and obtaining the necessary state permits. The project would utilize TVA land, deploying a solar cap system on the closed CCR facility at the TVA Shawnee Fossil Plant in Paducah, Kentucky. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio Self-Directed Solar . 
 
 Other Renewable Energy Resources. In addition to the hydroelectric units above, TVA owns nine operating solar installations that account for approximately one MW of nameplate capacity. Other renewable energy resources also include renewable energy purchases, a majority associated with TVA renewable programs. See Power Purchase and Other Agreements for information on renewable PPAs. TVA's current renewable programs and offerings include: 
 
 Small-scale Solutions . The Green Connect Program connects residential customers who are interested in on-site solar PV and/or battery storage systems with qualified solar and battery storage installers who agree to install to Green 
 Connect Program Standards. These qualified installers, who are members of TVA's Quality Contractor Network, are insured and 
 licensed and have also completed special training on TVA guidelines. Participants have access to objective information and the benefit of installation verifications with regard to whether their solar PV system has met the Green Connect Program Standards. 
 
 Utility-scale Solutions . The Green Invest Program matches customer demand with renewable supply through a Green Invest Agreement. The goal of the Green Invest Program is to meet the long-term sustainability needs of customers at scale. TVA procures the needed renewable supply through a diversified approach, which could include a competitive procurement process, strategic partnerships, or construction of renewable facilities to meet these needs. As of September 30, 2024, more than 1,950 MW of renewable PPAs have been matched to customers through the Green Invest Program. In addition, Generation Flexibility is a solution available to LPCs participating in TVA's Partnership Agreement and supports the deployment of up to 2,000 MW of distributed solar to provide clean, local generation. See Note 17 Revenue . 
 
 Other Renewable Solutions. The Green Switch Program allows customers to support solar renewable resources through purchasing renewable solar energy generated in the Tennessee Valley. The product is sold in blocks of 200 kWh or matches 100 percent of a customer's electricity usage (available through select LPCs). During the year ended September 30, 2024, participants purchased 67,122 MWh through the Green Switch Program. The Green Flex Program gives commercial and industrial customers the ability to meet sustainability goals and to make renewable energy claims through RECs from wind generation located outside TVA's service area. During the year ended September 30, 2024, participants purchased approximately 694,000 RECs through the Green Flex Program. 
 
 TVA tracks its renewable energy commitments and claims through the management of RECs. The RECs, which each represent one megawatt-hour ("MWh") of renewable energy generation, are principally associated with wind, solar, biomass, and low-impact hydroelectric. TVA continues to evaluate ways to adjust to customer preferences and requirements for cleaner and greener energy, including the acquisition of RECs from renewable purchased power that can be sold to customers to meet their needs. Overall, TVA will procure needed renewable supply through a diversified approach, which could include a competitive procurement process, strategic partnerships, or construction of renewable facilities to meet these needs.

Distributed Energy Resources 
 
 Consumer desire for energy choice, among other things, is driving the expectation for flexible options in the electric industry. TVA and LPCs are working together to leverage the strengths of the Tennessee Valley public power model to provide distributed energy solutions that are economical, sustainable, and flexible. TVA will focus on the safety and reliability impacts of these resources as they are interconnected to the grid and will aim to ensure that the pricing of electricity remains as low as feasible. Additional regulatory considerations and analysis may be required as the distributed energy resources ("DER") market, technologies, and programs evolve. 
 
 In 2017, the TVA Board authorized up to 300 million to be spent over the next 10 years, subject to annual budget availability and necessary environmental reviews, to build an enhanced fiber optic network that will better connect TVA's operational assets. Fiber is a vital part of TVA's modern communication infrastructure and is needed to help manage DER as they enter the market. The new fiber optic lines will also improve the reliability and resiliency of the generation and transmission system. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio Fiber Optic Network. 
 
 New energy management systems and energy storage technologies present opportunities for more sophisticated and integrated operation of the entire grid. The advent of electric vehicles and small-scale renewable generation has hastened the development of energy storage technologies that have the potential to mitigate the intermittent supply issues associated with many renewable generation options. Implementation of these technologies in conjunction with two-way communication to the site creates the potential for more efficient usage of other DER on the grid. 
 
 TVA is partnering with LPCs and others to support the electrification of transportation in the Tennessee Valley in a multi-year EV initiative. The initiative focuses on reducing or eliminating EV market barriers with EV policies, improving charging infrastructure availability, expanding EV availability and offerings, and spreading EV consumer awareness. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Electric Vehicles. 
 
 On-site energy management technologies and the proliferation of companies interested in providing services to support and aggregate the impacts of such systems provide another DER opportunity. Such systems can afford the consumer benefits through reduced consumption, increased comfort, detailed energy use data, and savings from time-sensitive rate structures. TVA and LPCs must consider the impacts of integration from changes in energy usage patterns resulting from the operation of such systems. 
 
 Demand response systems that take advantage of the increasing sophistication in communication to homes, businesses, and distribution system assets also afford the opportunity for more granular control of system demand. Technologies can manage individual customer systems to shift usage from peak to off-peak periods and create significant reductions in the need for peak generation output or curtail usage for short periods to balance system demand. More sophisticated distribution control systems can also lower peak demand through control of excess voltage on the grid on either a dispatchable or continuous basis. Some large industrial customers also have the capacity to respond within a designated notice period and can augment operational flexibility by providing ancillary services. See Community Energy Portfolio below . 
 
 Community Energy Portfolio 
 
 TVA continues to make investments in its community energy portfolio, consisting of energy efficiency, demand response, renewable, and resiliency programs, as part of its commitment to meet the Tennessee Valley s growing energy needs and to support a decarbonized and more resilient grid. TVA is expanding its portfolio and plans to invest more than 1.5 billion in its energy efficiency and demand response programs from 2024 2028. Over this five-year period, TVA anticipates approximately 2,200 gigawatt hours of net incremental energy efficiency savings and expects to have over 2,200 MW of demand response portfolio capacity in 2028. These amounts are forward-looking and subject to various uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Information and Item 1A, Risk Factors. In 2024, TVA invested 173 million in its energy efficiency and demand response programs. As of September 30, 2024, TVA has 1,444 MW of demand response peak season portfolio capacity and effectively reduced 2024 energy needs by approximately 205 gigawatt hours of net incremental energy efficiency savings. 
 
 TVA's community energy portfolio consists of programs aimed at balancing system needs by lowering costs, shaping energy usage, increasing capacity, and decarbonizing the grid, all through the participation of end-use consumers. These programs help end-use consumers save on their bills and reduce some of the need for new generation in the future and are offered to both end-use residential customers and businesses and industries. TVA also has energy programming focused on expanding partnerships, improving program access, and catalyzing investment in communities where all individuals can benefit from TVA's resources. TVA's Community Energy Efficiency Programs, a component of the community energy portfolio, include (1) the Home Uplift Program, which completes home evaluations and makes high-impact home energy upgrades for qualifying homeowners at no cost to the homeowners, (2) the School Uplift Program, which assists schools with adopting strategic energy management practices, and (3) the Small Business Uplift Program, which assists small businesses located within underserved communities with energy evaluations and energy improvement investments provided by TVA at no cost to the small business.

 TVA anticipates additional community energy programs to be developed over the coming years to grow the community energy portfolio. See Distributed Energy Resources above for further discussion on demand response systems. 
 
 Power Purchase and Other Agreements 
 
 TVA acquires power from a variety of power producers generally through long-term and short-term PPAs as well as through spot market purchases. During 2024, TVA acquired approximately 98 percent of the power that it purchased through the long-term PPAs described below, including agreements for long-term renewable generation resources, and approximately two percent on the spot market. During 2023, TVA acquired approximately 92 percent of the power that it purchased through long-term PPAs, approximately six percent through short-term PPAs, and approximately two percent on the spot market. 
 
 TVA's capability provided by PPAs is primarily provided under contracts that expire through 2044 and are described in the table below.

 Under federal law, TVA is required to purchase energy from qualifying facilities (cogenerators and small power producers) at TVA's avoided cost of either generating this energy itself or purchasing this energy from another source. TVA fulfills this requirement through the Dispersed Power Production Program. At September 30, 2024, there were 1,197 generation sources, with a combined qualifying capacity of 279 MW, whose power TVA purchases under this program. 

Fuel Supply 
 
 General 
 
 TVA's consumption of various types of fuel depends largely on the demand for electricity by TVA's customers, the availability of various generating units, and the availability and cost of fuel. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Financial Results Operating Expenses. 
 
 Nuclear Fuel 
 
 Current Fuel Supply . Converting uranium to nuclear fuel generally involves four stages: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas; the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and the fabrication of the enriched uranium hexafluoride into fuel assemblies. TVA plans to continue using contracts of various products, lengths, and terms as well as inventory to meet the projected nuclear fuel needs of its nuclear fleet. The net book value of TVA's nuclear fuel was 1.3 billion at both September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 On May 13, 2024, President Biden signed the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act into law. Further restrictions on 
 working with, and sanctions against, Russia or Russian entities may be forthcoming. TVA's currently contracted supply on 
 nuclear fuel will not be impacted by the new law or future sanctions or restrictions related to Russia. TVA's nuclear fuel is 
 supplied primarily by U.S., Canadian, Australian, and European Union sources, and TVA has existing physical inventories located 
 in the United States and Canada sufficient to fuel its reactors for many years. Further, existing federal law already prohibited 
 TVA from purchasing Russian or Chinese nuclear fuel. TVA is not contracted to purchase any Russian or Chinese origin nuclear 
 fuel, and has no Russian or Chinese origin nuclear fuel in inventory for use in its reactors. TVA could be impacted by higher market prices as a result of general market impacts resulting from the new law and other potential trade restrictions; however, at this time TVA's nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term contracts. 
 
 TVA, the DOE, and certain nuclear fuel contractors have entered into agreements, referred to as the Down-blend Offering for Tritium ("DBOT"), that provide for the production, processing, and storage of low-enriched uranium that is to be made using surplus DOE highly enriched uranium and other uranium. Low-enriched uranium can be fabricated into fuel for use in a nuclear power plant. Production of the low-enriched uranium began in 2019 and is contracted to continue through September 2027. Contract activity after that date will consist of storage and flag management. Flag management ensures that the uranium is unencumbered by policy restrictions, so that it can be used in connection with the production of tritium. Under the terms of the interagency agreement between the DOE and TVA, the DOE will reimburse TVA for a portion of the costs of converting the highly enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Down-blend Offering for Tritium for a more detailed discussion of the DBOT project. 
 
 Low-Level Radioactive Waste. Certain materials and supplies used in the normal operation of nuclear electrical generating units are potentially exposed to low levels of radiation. TVA sends shipments of low-level radioactive waste to burial facilities in Clive, Utah, and Andrews, Texas. TVA is capable of storing some low-level radioactive waste at its own facilities for an extended period of time, if necessary. 
 
 Spent Nuclear Fuel. All three nuclear sites have dry cask storage facilities. Sequoyah will need additional capacity by 2029. Browns Ferry will need additional capacity by 2037. Watts Bar will need additional capacity by 2039. To recover the cost of providing long-term, on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel, TVA filed a breach of contract suit against the U.S. in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in 2001. As a result of this lawsuit and related agreements, TVA has collected approximately 483 million through 2024. 
 
 Tritium-Related Services. TVA and the DOE are engaged in a long-term interagency agreement under which TVA will, at the DOE's request, irradiate tritium-producing burnable absorber rods ("TPBARs") to assist the DOE in producing tritium for 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 the Department of Defense ("DOD"). This agreement, which ends in 2040, requires the DOE to reimburse TVA for the costs that TVA incurs in connection with providing irradiation services and to pay TVA an irradiation services fee at a specified rate per TPBAR over the period when irradiation occurs. 
 
 In general, TPBARs are irradiated for one operating cycle, which lasts about 18 months. At the end of the cycle, TVA removes the irradiated rods and loads them into a shipping cask. The DOE then ships them to its tritium-extraction facility. TVA loads a fresh set of TPBARs into the reactor during each refueling outage. Irradiating the TPBARs does not affect TVA's ability to safely operate the reactors to produce electricity. 
 
 TVA has provided irradiation services using Watts Bar Unit 1 since 2003 and Watts Bar Unit 2 since 2021. TVA has increased its production to within currently licensed limits for Watts Bar Unit 1 and expects to be within licensed limits for Watts Bar Unit 2 in April 2025. The DOE notified TVA of future increased needs for tritium, and TVA submitted a License Amendment Request in 2023 to fulfill this request. This request was approved by the NRC in April 2024. The DOE's decision also allows for irradiation of TPBARs at Sequoyah in the future; however, TVA does not have plans to employ Sequoyah units for tritium production in the near term. 
 
 Natural Gas and Fuel Oil 
 
 During 2024, TVA purchased a significant amount of its natural gas requirements from a variety of suppliers under contracts with terms of up to five years and purchased substantially all of its fuel oil requirements on the spot market . The net book value of TVA's natural gas inventory was 23 million and 25 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net book value of TVA's fuel oil inventory was 72 million and 84 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, 61 of the combustion turbine assets were dual-fuel capable, and TVA has fuel oil stored on each of these sites as a backup to natural gas. 
 
 TVA purchases natural gas from multiple suppliers on a daily, monthly, seasonal, and term basis. TVA uses contracts of various lengths and terms to meet the projected natural gas needs of its natural gas fleet. During 2024, TVA arranged for the transportation of natural gas on eight separate pipelines, with approximately 69 percent being transported on two pipelines. During 2024, TVA maintained a total of approximately 1,887,883 million British thermal unit(s) ("mmBtu") per day of firm transportation capacity on eight major pipelines, with approximately 63 percent of total firm transportation capacity being maintained on two pipelines. 
 
 TVA utilizes natural gas storage services at eight facilities with a total capacity of 7.8 billion per cubic feet ("Bcf") of firm service and 7.3 Bcf of interruptible service to manage the daily balancing requirements of the eight pipelines used by TVA, with approximately 52 percent of the total storage capacity being maintained at two facilities. During 2024, storage levels were generally maintained at between 40 and 80 percent of the maximum contracted capacity at each facility. As TVA's natural gas requirements grow, it is anticipated that additional storage capacity may need to be acquired to meet the needs of the generating assets. In 2025, TVA expects to increase its storage portfolio by approximately three percent. 
 
 Coal 
 
 Coal consumption at TVA's coal-fired generating facilities during both 2024 and 2023 was approximately 12 million tons. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, TVA had 28 days and 21 days of system-wide coal supply at full burn rate, respectively, with net book values of 191 million and 204 million, respectively. 
 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 TVA utilizes both short-term and long-term coal contracts. During 2024, long-term contracts made up 94 percent of coal purchases, and short-term contracts accounted for the remaining six percent. TVA plans to continue using contracts of various lengths, terms, and coal quality to meet its expected consumption and inventory requirements. During 2024 and 2023, TVA purchased coal by basin as follows: 

The following charts present the proportion of each delivery method TVA utilizes for its coal supply for the periods indicated: 
 
 Coal inventory decreased at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023. Coal supply availability and transportation performance continued to improve in 2023 and 2024. Throughout 2024, TVA was able to meet burn and increase inventory stockpiles due to current market conditions reflecting an approximate balance between demand and available supply, weaker export markets, and stable natural gas prices. TVA also invested in additional multi-year coal supply contracts to help provide stability in coal supply availability. These investments are expected to support fuel resilience with TVA's overall coal supply. 

Transmission 
 
 The TVA transmission system is one of the largest high-voltage transmission systems in North America. TVA's transmission system has 69 interconnections with 13 neighboring electric systems and delivered approximately 163 billion kWh of electricity to TVA customers in 2024. In carrying out its responsibility for transmission grid reliability in the TVA service area, the TVA transmission grid has operated with 99.999 percent reliability since 2000. See Item 2, Properties Transmission Properties . 
 
 Pursuant to its Transmission Service Guidelines, TVA offers transmission services to eligible customers to transmit wholesale power in a manner that is comparable to TVA's own use of the transmission system. TVA has also adopted and operates in accordance with its published Transmission Standards of Conduct and separates its transmission function from its 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 power marketing function. As a Balancing Authority, Distribution Provider, Generator Owner, Generator Operator, Planning Coordinator, Reliability Coordinator, Resource Planner, Transmission Owner, Transmission Operator, Transmission Planner, and Transmission Service Provider, as those terms are defined for purposes of North American Electric Reliability Corporation ("NERC") regulations, TVA is also subject to federal reliability standards that are set forth by the NERC and approved by FERC. See Regulation . 
 
 Additional transmission upgrades may be required to maintain reliability. Upgrades may include enhancements to existing lines and substations or new installations as necessary to provide adequate power transmission capacity, maintain voltage support, and ensure generating plant and transmission system stability. In addition to upgrades to maintain reliability, TVA s Grid of Tomorrow initiative aims to increase grid flexibility to enable greater use of renewable resources such as solar, wind, and other forms of distributed generation and includes making data and communications upgrades as demonstrated by investments in the new system operations center, energy management system, and fiber optic network. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio. 
 
 In recognition of the challenges of integrating intermittent and inverter-based resources to the power system, TVA established the Future Grid Performance initiative. The primary goal is to maintain a stable and reliable grid while fostering the evolution of the energy system of the future, one of TVA's strategic elements of Operational Excellence. Secondary goals include improving processes to facilitate an evolving resource mix with new technologies, optimizing approaches and tools to ensure system stability and performance in the future grid, and evaluating and adopting new grid technologies. This initiative seeks to address grid needs to keep the grid reliable and stable as TVA transitions to an energy system that has a greater share of intermittent and inverter-based resources, such as renewables and battery storage, connected to the transmission system. 
 
 In addition, TVA is working on various projects with universities, Electric Power Research Institute ("EPRI"), and others to help enable a dynamic and multi-directional grid. TVA is also working in partnership with LPCs to modernize their distribution systems by developing a shared vision and roadmap for transforming the Tennessee Valley s transmission and distribution systems into an integrated regional grid. 
 
 These initiatives support TVA s decarbonization efforts while helping ensure TVA continues to achieve its mission to deliver reliable power at the lowest feasible rate. Investments in a modernized grid will help enable enhanced monitoring and control of TVA s transmission and generation portfolio. 

Weather and Seasonality 
 
 Weather affects both the demand for and the market prices of electricity. TVA's power system is generally a dual-peaking system in which the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. TVA uses degree days to measure the impact of weather on its power operations. Degree days measure the extent to which the TVA system 23-station average temperatures vary from 65 degrees Fahrenheit. See Item 1, Business Flood Control Activities , Item 1, Business Environmental Matters Climate Change Physical Impacts of Climate Change, Item 1A, Risk Factors Risks Related to the Environment and Catastrophic Events, and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Sales of Electricity. 

Competition 
 
 TVA provides electricity in a service area that is largely free of competition from other electric power providers. This service area is defined primarily by provisions of law and long-term contracts. The region in which TVA or LPCs that distribute TVA power may provide power is limited and is often referred to as the "fence." Under the FPA, the Anti-Cherrypicking Amendment ("ACPA") limits the ability of others to use the TVA transmission system for the purpose of serving customers within TVA's service area. State service territory laws limit unregulated third parties' ability to sell electricity to consumers. All TVA wholesale power contracts are all requirements contracts; however, Power Supply Flexibility Agreements available to LPCs that have executed long-term Partnership Agreements with TVA allow LPCs to locally generate or purchase up to approximately five percent of their average total hourly energy sales over a certain time period in order to meet their individual customers' needs. Revised flexibility agreements were made available to LPCs in August 2023. These revised agreements permit projects to be located anywhere in TVA's service area, connected either to the LPC distribution system or to TVA's transmission system, and make it easier for LPCs to partner on projects. In addition, other utilities may use their own transmission lines to serve customers within TVA's service area, and third parties are able to avoid the restrictions on serving end-use customers by selling or leasing generating assets to a customer rather than selling electricity. These threats underscore the need for TVA to design rates and strategically price its products and services to be competitive. There have also been some efforts to erode the ACPA, and the protection of the provision could be limited and perhaps eliminated by federal legislation at some time in the future. 
 
 TVA also faces competition in the form of emerging technologies. Improvements in energy efficiency technologies, smart technologies, and energy storage technologies may reduce the demand for centrally provided power. The growing interest by customers in generating their own power through DER has the potential to lead to a reduction in the load served by TVA as well as cause TVA to re-evaluate how it operates the overall grid system to continue to provide highly reliable power at affordable 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 rates. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio Fiber Optic Network. 
 
 Finally, TVA and other utility companies are facing an evolving marketplace of increased competition driven by customer choice and behavior. As technology develops, consumers' demands for access to diverse products and services may increase, and customers could choose another utility to meet some or all of their power needs where available, pursue self-generation to meet some or all of their power needs, or move their operations outside of TVA's service territory. 

Research and Development 
 
 Investments in TVA's research portfolio are supported through partnership and collaboration with LPCs, EPRI, the DOE, federal agencies, peer utilities, universities, and industry vendors and through participation in professional societies and other research consortiums. 
 
 Annual investments made in science and technological innovation help meet future business and operational challenges. Each year, TVA's annual research portfolio is updated based on a broad range of operational and industry drivers to assess key technology gaps, performance issues, or other significant issues, addressed through research and development. Core research activities directly support optimization of TVA's generation and transmission assets, air and water quality, energy utilization, and distributed/clean energy integration. TVA also provides research and development services on behalf of LPCs by helping optimize their distribution systems and helping minimize technology gaps in energy utilization and consumer technologies. 
 
 TVA places a high priority on providing innovation and research efforts to close gaps and develop the energy system of the future which are organized around its transformative innovation initiatives: advanced nuclear solutions, decarbonization options, storage integration, regional grid transformation, electric vehicles evolution, connected communities, and the newest - Future Grid Performance. TVA has placed an emphasis on research leading to the understanding and application of clean resources to support the reduction of carbon emissions from its power supply. This research supports both TVA and national strategic interests to reduce carbon emissions and is designed to both catalyze and support TVA s decarbonization initiative. 
 
 TVA is committed to investing in the future of nuclear and continues to evaluate the licensing and design of emerging nuclear technologies, such as advanced light water SMRs and advanced non-light water reactors, as part of technology innovation efforts aimed at developing the energy system of the future, one of TVA's strategic elements of Operational Excellence. In December 2019, TVA became the first utility in the nation to successfully obtain approval for an early site permit from the NRC to potentially construct and operate SMRs at its Clinch River Site. TVA has entered into memorandums of understanding and agreements that allow for mutual collaboration to explore advanced reactor designs as a next-generation nuclear technology while leveraging the expertise of federally funded research and development centers, utilities, vendors, and academic institutions. These contractual relationships are important steps in the early stages of evaluation as TVA considers the economic feasibility of advanced nuclear reactors. These contractual relationships are also intended to leverage innovations to improve advanced nuclear designs, streamline licensing pathways, find efficiencies in construction methods, and optimize operating expenses. For example, TVA has entered into a multi-party collaborative arrangement to advance the global development of the GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy BWRX-300 SMR. See Note 21 Collaborative Arrangement for additional information on the multi-party collaboration arrangement. TVA currently believes that this advanced nuclear reactor technology is most readily available for deployment with the fewest risks; as such, TVA is evaluating this technology in greater detail, while still considering other advanced reactor technologies. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio Small Modular Reactors for additional discussion and total costs related to SMR work. TVA is also partnering on the exploration of fusion technology. 
 
 TVA is a founding member of the Low Carbon Resources Initiative ("LCRI"), which is a coalition of utilities and researchers led by EPRI and the Gas Technology Institute. The LCRI's purpose is to engage, inform, support, and accelerate global low-carbon solutions creating pathways to advance carbon reducing technologies for large scale utility deployment. The initial five-year initiative from 2020 to 2024 will extend into 2027 and includes foundational technical research and demonstration projects support creating resource options, such as alternative fuels (hydrogen, ammonia, and methanized derivatives), carbon capture, electrification, and utilization of clean DER as part of the overall low-carbon resource mix. TVA plans to continue involvement with LCRI to support demonstrations of technologies itself and gain knowledge from other demonstrations which can support pathways to decarbonization. TVA has made progress understanding regional geology and carbon capture technologies and is evaluating both with an emphasis on the potential for carbon capture in TVA's future. To support this initiative, in 2023 TVA entered into an MOU to study the development, construction, and operation of carbon capture, utilization, transportation, and sequestration infrastructure at or near TVA s Ackerman and Paradise Combined Cycle Plants. 
 
 At the forefront of the energy storage initiative is deploying grid-scale battery energy storage technology to optimize the existing TVA generation assets and improve the resiliency of the transmission system. In 2020, TVA launched its first TVA-owned, grid scale, lithium-ion demonstration battery project, and in 2023, TVA began construction near Vonore, Tennessee. The 20 MW battery system was installed in the first quarter of 2024, and the site is progressing toward construction completion with the expectation to begin testing and commissioning by the first quarter of 2025. TVA is also evaluating a battery energy storage system utilizing grid-forming inverters. Additionally, TVA is contracting for several battery energy storage systems to be deployed in the region by third-party developers who will make their systems available for TVA dispatch as described in Part II, Item 7, 
 25

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Renewable Power Purchase Agreements. The system integration lessons learned from these projects will guide future application of battery storage as part of the evolving bulk power system in the region. TVA is studying the optimal siting and design for another pumped-storage plant as described in Power Supply and Load Management Resources Hydroelectric Pumped-Storage . TVA is also evaluating the potential of short duration battery alternatives to lithium-ion and long duration storage alternatives to pumped-storage. 
 
 TVA continues to develop potential electrification programs, in addition to the Fast Charge Network, that improve resource use and reduce environmental impacts in the transportation sector. TVA programs are based on previous assessments, which included a multi-stakeholder vision and roadmap effort aimed at identifying the path forward for electric vehicles in Tennessee. The approach provides for broad engagement from industry, government, and utilities that could be applied in other states in the TVA service territory. In addition, TVA is continuing its evaluation of potential electric vehicle adoption strategies through coordination of activities with EPRI and state and industry stakeholders related to operational fleet requirements.

 TVA has 23 Connected Communities pilot projects with many different stakeholders across four focus areas: Broadband and Digital Literacy, Economic Empowerment, Energy and Environmental Justice, and Enhanced Community Resiliency. Connected Communities pilot projects are aimed at addressing today s challenges with community-driven information and technology solutions for a modernized energy system. Connected Communities has ten community partnerships to provide consulting services to test a framework for engaging communities to help set goals, scope projects, and apply for funding. Research will continue to identify best practices, better understand challenges in the Tennessee Valley, and scale up learnings from the projects to broader applications throughout the Tennessee Valley. 
 
 TVA and LPCs are engaged in several initiatives related to regional grid transformation. Research includes technologies and applications advancement in intelligent distribution systems. Smart meter technology has the potential to shift usage patterns away from peak demand times which could change costs significantly. Additionally, intelligent transmission systems would give TVA the ability to nearly instantaneously diagnose problems, make corrections, and engage transmission and generation resources quickly so that power would keep flowing. This could promote reduced emissions, lower energy costs, and add greater flexibility to accommodate the new consumer-generated sources under TVA's renewable energy programs. TVA also worked with LPC partners to execute a survey of LPC technology capabilities and plans, and the results are helping shape a realistic path toward TVA's long-term goals. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources Distributed Energy Resources and Transmission . 
 
 Finally, in 2023, TVA began an initiative called Future Grid Performance. This initiative seeks to address grid needs to keep the grid reliable and stable as TVA transitions to an energy system that has a greater share of intermittent and inverter-based resources, such as renewables and battery storage, connected to the transmission system. See Transmission above for more information on this initiative. 

Flood Control Activities 
 
 The Tennessee River watershed has one of the highest annual rainfall totals of any watershed in the U.S., averaging 51 inches per year. During 2024, approximately 52 inches of rain fell in the Tennessee Valley. TVA manages the Tennessee River system in an integrated manner, which includes managing minimum river flows and minimum depths for navigation, reducing flood damage, generating low-cost hydroelectric power, maintaining flows that support habitat for fish and other aquatic species, maintaining water supply, and providing recreational opportunities for the Tennessee Valley. In addition, having cool water available helps TVA to meet thermal compliance and support normal operation of TVA's nuclear and fossil-fueled plants, while oxygenating water helps fish species remain healthy. TVA spills or releases excess water through its dams in order to reduce flood damage to the Tennessee Valley. TVA typically spills only when all available hydroelectric generating turbines are operating at full capacity and additional water still needs to be moved downstream. 
 
 The Tennessee Valley experienced just above normal rainfall at 104 percent of normal and runoff at 81 percent of normal during 2024. Although runoff for 2024 was below normal due to fewer significant rain events, the winter and spring timing of above normal rainfall during the period supported TVA's objective to generate low-cost hydroelectric power while also meeting its river system commitments, including flood mitigation, which is estimated to have prevented damages across the Tennessee Valley of approximately 406 million in 2024 and 10.1 billion over TVA's recorded history. 

Environmental Stewardship Activities 
 
 TVA's mission includes managing the Tennessee River, its tributaries, and federal lands along the shoreline to provide, among other things, year-round navigation, flood damage reduction, affordable and reliable electricity, recreational opportunities, adequate water supply, improved water quality, and natural resource protection. There are 49 dams that comprise TVA's integrated reservoir system. Each dam may also have ancillary structures used to support or assist the main dam's function. The reservoir system provides approximately 800 miles of commercially navigable waterways and also provides significant flood reduction benefits both within the Tennessee River system and downstream on the lower Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 reservoir system also provides a water supply for residential and industrial customers, as well as cooling water for TVA's coal-fired plants, combined cycle plants, and nuclear power plants. TVA's Environmental Policy provides objectives for an integrated approach related to providing reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy; engaging in proactive stewardship of the Tennessee River system and public lands; and supporting sustainable economic growth. The Environmental Policy also provides additional direction in several environmental stewardship areas related to reducing environmental impacts on the Tennessee Valley's natural resources, including reducing carbon intensity and air emissions; minimizing waste; and protecting water resources and cultural resources. TVA's Biodiversity Policy further builds on the TVA record of environmental stewardship by acknowledging the critical role of natural systems in achieving its mission of improving the quality of life in the region. The policy commits to seeking conservation opportunities within capital projects and improving current operational practices to help minimize impacts, reduce costs, and enhance biodiversity. 
 
 TVA serves the people of the TVA region through the integrated management of the Tennessee River system and public lands, which include approximately 11,000 miles of shoreline; 650,000 surface acres of reservoir water; and 293,000 acres of reservoir lands. TVA accomplishes this mission and supports the objectives of the TVA Environmental Policy through implementation of its natural resources stewardship strategy. Within this strategy, TVA confirms a desire to remain agile, balance competing demands, and be a catalyst for collaboration in order to protect and enhance biological, cultural, and water resources as well as create and sustain destinations for recreation and opportunities for learning and research. As part of the strategy, TVA intends to assist water-based community development with the issuance of permits, technical support, and land agreements using planning, clear regulations, meaningful guidelines, and consistent enforcement. Additional guidance for carrying out many of TVA's essential stewardship responsibilities is provided in TVA's Natural Resource Plan . The plan aligns TVA's mission with the stewardship strategy and includes ten focus areas that provide a comprehensive view of resource stewardship efforts.

 Economic Development Activities 
 
 Economic development, along with energy production and environmental stewardship, is one of the primary statutory purposes of TVA. Economic development programs developed by TVA support all communities, including rural and economically distressed communities, across the Tennessee Valley . Through its economic development activities, TVA endeavors to recruit and retain companies in targeted business sectors, foster capital investment and job growth, and assist communities in the Tennessee Valley with economic growth opportunities. 
 
 TVA seeks to achieve these goals through a combination of initiatives and partnerships with LPCs, regional, state, and local agencies, and communities by providing financial incentives, technical services, industry expertise, and site-selection assistance to new and existing businesses in the Tennessee Valley. TVA's economic development incentive programs offer competitive incentives to new and existing power customers in certain business sectors that make multi-year commitments to invest in the Tennessee Valley. See Note 17 Revenue Contract Balances Economic Development Incentives for total incentives recorded. 
 
 In 2024, TVA's economic development efforts and programs helped attract or expand 175 companies into the TVA service area. These companies announced the following economic performance measures: 
 
 Economic Performance Measure At September 30, 2024 (1) 
 Projected capital investments 8.9 billion Jobs expected to be created (#) (2) 
 10,368 Jobs expected to be retained (#) (3) 
 42,393 
 Notes 
 (1) These amounts are forward-looking and are subject to various uncertainties. Amounts may differ materially based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, economic downturns or recessions. See Forward-Looking Information and Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 (2) "New jobs" in the TVA fiscal year are newly created, paid positions at a facility of a TVA customer. Positions are calculated by adding (1) the number of full-time, on-site employees and/or independent contractors at the facility, (2) the total number of full-time work-from-home employees and independent contractors who reside in the TVA service territory and who spend 100 of their work time on facility-related matters, and (3) the total hours worked on facility-related matters by (a) full-time and part-time on-site employees at the facility and (b) full-time and part-time work-from-home employees who reside in the TVA service territory and who spend less than 100 of their work time on facility-related matters, divided by the number of work hours of such employees based on a 40 hour work week. A TVA customer means an entity that purchases power from TVA or a distributor of TVA power. New jobs reported by TVA may include positions created during the current TVA fiscal year and certified projections of anticipated positions to be created within a five-year time frame. New job numbers reported by TVA are certified and provided to TVA by TVA customers. 
 (3) "Retained jobs" are paid positions at a facility of a TVA customer that were created prior to the current TVA fiscal year and that continue to be filled in the current TVA fiscal year. Positions are calculated by adding (1) the number of full-time, on-site employees and/or independent contractors at the facility, (2) the total number of full-time work-from-home employees and independent contractors who reside in the TVA service territory and who spend 100 of their work time on facility-related matters, and (3) the total hours worked on facility-related matters by (a) full-time and part-time on-site employees at the facility and (b) full-time and part-time work-from-home employees who reside in the TVA service territory and who spend less than 100 of their work time on facility-related matters, divided by the number of work hours of such employees based on a 40 hour work week. A TVA customer means an entity that purchases power from TVA or a distributor of TVA power. Retained job numbers reported by TVA are certified and provided to TVA by TVA customers. 

Regulation 
 
 TVA is required to comply with comprehensive and complex laws, regulations, and orders. The costs of complying with these laws, regulations, and orders are expected to be substantial, and costs could be significantly more than TVA anticipates. 
 
 Congress 
 
 TVA exists pursuant to the TVA Act as enacted by Congress and carries on its operations in accordance with this legislation. Congress can enact legislation expanding or reducing TVA's activities, change TVA's structure, and even eliminate TVA. Congress can also enact legislation requiring the sale of some or all of the assets TVA operates or reduce the U.S.'s ownership in TVA. To allow TVA to operate more flexibly than a traditional government agency, Congress exempted TVA from all or parts of certain general federal laws that govern other agencies, such as federal labor relations laws and the laws related to the hiring of federal employees, the procurement of supplies and services, and the acquisition of land. Other federal laws enacted since the creation of TVA that are applicable to other agencies have been made applicable to TVA, including those related to paying employees overtime and protecting the environment, cultural resources, and civil rights. 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission 
 
 Section 37 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") requires TVA to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") such periodic, current, and supplementary information, documents, and reports as would be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act if TVA were an issuer of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Section 37 of the Exchange Act exempts TVA from complying with Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act, which requires each member of a listed issuer's audit committee to be an independent member of the board of directors of the issuer. Since TVA is an agency and instrumentality of the U.S., securities issued or guaranteed by TVA are "exempted securities" under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and may be offered and sold without registration under the Securities Act. In addition, securities issued or guaranteed by TVA are "exempted securities" and "government 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 securities" under the Exchange Act. TVA is also exempt from Sections 14(a)-(d) and 14(f)-(h) of the Exchange Act (which address proxy solicitations) insofar as those sections relate to securities issued by TVA, and transactions in TVA securities are exempt from rules governing tender offers under Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act. Also, since TVA securities are exempted securities under the Securities Act, TVA is exempt from the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 insofar as it relates to securities issued by TVA, and no independent trustee is required for these securities. 
 
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
 
 Under the FPA, TVA is not a "public utility," a term which primarily refers to investor-owned utilities. Therefore, TVA is not subject to the full jurisdiction that FERC exercises over public utilities under the FPA. TVA is, however, an "electric utility" and a "transmitting utility" as defined in the FPA and, thus, is directly subject to certain aspects of FERC's jurisdiction. Under the FPA, for example, TVA (1) must comply with certain standards designed to maintain transmission system reliability; (2) can be ordered to interconnect its transmission facilities with the electrical facilities of independent generators and of other electric utilities that meet certain requirements; (3) can be ordered to transmit wholesale power provided that the order (a) does not impair the reliability of the TVA or surrounding systems, (b) meets the applicable requirements concerning terms, conditions, and rates for service, and (c) does not implicate the ACPA; (4) could be subject to FERC review of the transmission rates and the terms and conditions of service that TVA provides; and (5) is prohibited from (a) reporting false information on the price of electricity sold at wholesale or the availability of transmission capacity to a federal agency with intent to fraudulently affect the data being compiled by the agency and (b) using manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances in connection with the purchase or sale of power or transmission services subject to FERC's jurisdiction. 
 
 In addition, the FPA provides FERC with authority (1) to order refunds of excessive prices on short-term sales (transactions lasting 31 days or less) by all market participants, including TVA, in price gouging situations if such sales are through an independent system operator or regional transmission organization under a FERC-approved tariff; (2) to issue regulations requiring the reporting, on a timely basis, of information about the availability and prices of wholesale power and transmission service by all market participants, including TVA; (3) to investigate electric industry practices, including TVA's operations that are subject to FERC's jurisdiction; and (4) to impose civil penalties of up to 1 million per day for each violation of the provisions of the FPA discussed in the prior paragraph that are applicable to TVA. Criminal penalties may also result from such violations. 
 
 Furthermore, while not required to do so, TVA has elected to implement various FERC orders and regulations pertaining to public utilities on a voluntary basis to the extent that they are consistent with TVA's obligations under the TVA Act. 
 
 Finally, on July 28, 2023, FERC issued Order No. 2023. The order updates the procedures for interconnecting generating facilities and is intended to address interconnection queue backlogs, improve certainty in the interconnection process, and encourage the evaluation of alternative transmission technologies. TVA has revised its generation interconnection procedures and agreements to align with Order No. 2023, effective November 1, 2024. 
 
 NERC Compliance 
 
 TVA is subject to federal reliability standards that are set forth by NERC and approved by FERC. These standards are designed to maintain the reliability of the bulk electric system, including TVA's generation and transmission system, and include areas such as maintenance, training, operations, planning, modeling, critical infrastructure, physical and cyber security, vegetation management, and facility ratings. TVA recognizes that reliability standards and expectations continue to become more complex and stringent for transmission systems. 
 
 Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
 
 TVA operates its nuclear facilities in a highly regulated environment and is subject to the oversight of the NRC, an independent federal agency that sets the rules that users of radioactive materials must follow. The NRC has broad authority to impose requirements relating to the licensing, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear generating facilities. In addition, if TVA fails to comply with requirements promulgated by the NRC, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down units, or modify, suspend, or revoke TVA's operating licenses. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Operational Challenges. 
 
 Environmental Protection Agency 
 
 TVA is subject to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") in a variety of areas, including air quality control, water quality control, management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and greenhouse gas ("GHG") reductions to address climate change. See Environmental Matters below and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges. 
 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 States 
 
 The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states, without federal legislative consent, from regulating the manner in which the federal government conducts its activities. As a federal agency, TVA is exempt from regulation, control, and taxation by states except in certain areas where Congress has clearly made TVA subject to state regulation. See Environmental Matters below. 
 
 Other Federal Entities 
 
 TVA's activities and records are also subject to review to varying degrees by other federal entities, including the Government Accountability Office and the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB"). There is also an Office of the Inspector General which reviews TVA's activities and records. 

Taxation and Tax Equivalents 
 
 TVA is not subject to federal income taxation. In addition, neither TVA nor its property, franchises, or income is subject to taxation by states or their subdivisions. The TVA Act, however, does require TVA to make tax equivalent payments to states and counties in which TVA conducts power operations or in which TVA has acquired properties previously subject to state and local taxation. The total amount of these payments is five percent of gross revenues from the sale of power during the preceding year excluding sales or deliveries to other federal agencies and off-system sales with other utilities, with a provision for minimum payments under certain circumstances. Except for certain direct payments TVA is required to make to counties, distribution of tax equivalent payments within a state is determined by individual state legislation. 

Environmental Matters 
 
 TVA's activities, particularly its power generation activities, are subject to comprehensive regulation under environmental laws and regulations relating to air pollution, water pollution, and management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, among other matters. The environmental laws and regulations that have the largest impact on TVA's operations and financial condition are discussed below. 
 
 Clean Air Act Programs and Regulations 
 
 National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The CAA requires EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") for certain air pollutants. EPA has set NAAQS for ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide ("SO 2 "), nitrogen oxides ("NO x "), carbon monoxide, and lead. Over the years, EPA has made the NAAQS more stringent. Each state must develop a plan to be approved by EPA for achieving and maintaining NAAQS within its borders. These plans impose limits on emissions from pollution sources, which are applicable to certain TVA generating units, including fossil fuel-fired plants. Areas meeting a NAAQS are designated as attainment areas. Areas not meeting a NAAQS are designated as non-attainment areas, and more stringent requirements apply in those areas, including stricter controls on industrial facilities and more complicated and public permitting processes. TVA fossil fuel-fired plants can be impacted by these requirements. Currently, all TVA generating units are located in areas designated as attainment areas. On March 6, 2024, however, EPA finalized more stringent NAAQS for particulate matter that may increase the likelihood of certain areas in TVA s service territory being designated as non-attainment areas. TVA could incur significant costs associated with upgrades to facilities if such facilities are in areas that are redesignated as being in non-attainment. The more stringent NAAQS are currently subject to a legal challenge seeking to overturn the standards. 
 
 Revised Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. TVA power plants are subject to EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR"). CSAPR addresses air pollution from upwind states in the U.S. that affect air quality in downwind states and is focused on NO x and SO 2 . To comply with CSAPR, TVA power plants must obtain one NO x allowance for every ton of NO x emitted during the ozone season. Under a revised version of CSAPR (the "Revised CSAPR Update Rule"), the Shawnee Fossil Plant ("Shawnee") facility is subject to reduced ozone-season NO x allowances and has been required to use most of its allowance inventory. In 2024, TVA monitored forecasted needs and utilized purchased allowances for the Shawnee facility. A longer-term compliance strategy for the facility is being developed that may include installing NO x control upgrades, incorporating operational changes, and continuing to purchase allowances. When completed, this strategy will help TVA comply with both the Revised CSAPR Update Rule and the Federal Implementation Plan Addressing Regional Ozone Transport for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. TVA has obtained approval from the State of Kentucky for construction of seven selective catalytic reduction systems ("SCRs") at the Shawnee facility. In 2024, TVA constructed an SCR on Shawnee Unit 7 and is constructing SCRs at three additional Shawnee Units by the end of 2025. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 189 million and expects to spend an additional 51 million. TVA is evaluating plans for the remaining units. 
 
 Federal Implementation Plan Addressing Regional Ozone Transport for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. On March 15, 2023, EPA issued final regulations known as the "Good Neighbor Plan" to reduce NO x emissions from power plants and certain industrial facilities. With the Good Neighbor Plan, EPA issued its Federal Implementation Plan ("FIP") that covers 23 states, including Alabama, Kentucky, and Mississippi, to reduce the interstate transport of NO x . Under the rule, beginning with the 2023 ozone season, power plants in 22 states, including Alabama, Kentucky, and Mississippi, are required to participate in a NO x 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 trading program. Over time, the emission budgets will decline based on the level of reductions achievable through phased installation of emissions controls at power plants starting in 2024. The rule also establishes daily emission rates for coal steam electric generating units greater than or equal to 100 MW in the covered states beginning with the 2024 ozone season. To help comply with these regulations, TVA is developing a longer-term compliance strategy for its Shawnee facility that may include installing NO x control upgrades, incorporating operational changes, and continuing to purchase allowances. See Revised Cross-State Air Pollution Rule above. During 2023, EPA issued interim rules to stay the effectiveness of the 2023 FIP requirements for emission sources in several states, including Kentucky, Mississippi, and Alabama. The Good Neighbor Plan itself has been challenged in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("D.C. Circuit"), and applications were filed with the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the plan while its merits are being litigated. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the Good Neighbor Plan. The stay prevents EPA from applying the Good Neighbor Plan in 23 affected states, including Alabama, Kentucky, and Mississippi, pending the disposition of the petition for review. TVA cannot predict the outcome of the litigation or how it may impact its operations. 
 
 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Electric Utility Units . On May 7, 2024, EPA published a final rule that strengthens and updates the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards MATS for electric generating units ("EGUs") to reflect recent developments in control technologies. The rule lowers the emission standard for filterable particulate matter ("PM") from 0.030 lbs/MMBtu to 0.010 lbs/MMBtu, with compliance to be demonstrated solely through the use of PM Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems. The rule is subject to legal challenges. If the challenges are not successful, the rule could require TVA to refurbish existing pollution control equipment at some of its coal-fired units, and the cost of such refurbishments could be substantial. 
 
 Environmental Agreements. In 2011, TVA entered into two substantively similar agreements, one with EPA and the other with Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and three environmental advocacy groups (collectively, the "Environmental Agreements"). To resolve alleged New Source Review claims, TVA committed under the Environmental Agreements to, among other things, take now-completed actions regarding coal-fired units and invest 290 million in certain TVA environmental projects. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings Environmental Agreements , which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Acid Rain Program. EPA's Acid Rain Program is intended to help reduce emissions of SO 2 and NO x , which are the primary pollutants implicated in the formation of acid rain. The program includes a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO 2 emissions from power plants. TVA continues to reduce SO 2 and NO x emissions from its coal-fired plants, and the SO 2 allowances allocated to TVA under the Acid Rain Program are sufficient to cover the operation of its coal-fired plants. In the TVA service area, the limitations imposed on SO 2 and NO x emissions by the CSAPR program are more stringent than the Acid Rain Program. Therefore, TVA does not anticipate that the Acid Rain Program will impose any additional material requirements on TVA. 
 
 Regional Haze Program . EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule, which required certain older sources to install best available retrofit technology. No additional controls or lower operating limits are required for any TVA units to meet best available retrofit technology requirements. In 2017, EPA published the final rule that changed some of the requirements for Regional Haze State Implementation Plans ("SIPs"). Specific impacts on TVA cannot be determined until future Regional Haze SIPs are developed for the next decennial review under the visibility haze provisions of the CAA. States were required to submit their Regional Haze SIPs to EPA by July 31, 2021. In response to requests from state air pollution control agencies in Tennessee and Kentucky, TVA submitted regional haze analyses for its Cumberland and Shawnee facilities, respectively, to those state agencies. The reports evaluate SO 2 emission reduction options for these facilities and will be considered by these state agencies in preparing their Regional Haze SIPs. On August 25, 2022, EPA issued a final action stating that 15 states, including Kentucky, failed to submit a complete SIP, which triggered a two-year deadline for EPA to promulgate a FIP for the state unless Kentucky submits, and EPA approves, a SIP satisfying the visibility protection requirements of the CAA. TVA negotiated with Kentucky and agreed to accept a federal limit for SO 2 emissions starting January 1, 2028. In August 2023, TVA submitted a Title V permit application to the Kentucky Division of Air Quality that incorporates this limit. TVA anticipates that it could meet this limit by installing control technologies for the seven uncontrolled Shawnee units. On June 4, 2024, the Kentucky Division of Air Quality made Kentucky's Regional Haze SIP available for public comments and expects to submit the final SIP to EPA after consideration of those public comments. See Revised Cross-State Air Pollution Rule above for additional information regarding TVA s plans to control the Shawnee units. 
 
 Start Up, Shutdown, and Malfunctions. Opacity, or visible emissions, measures the denseness or color of power plant plumes and has traditionally been used by states as a means of monitoring good maintenance and operation of particulate control equipment. Under some conditions, retrofitting a unit with additional equipment to better control SO 2 and NO x emissions can adversely affect opacity emissions, and TVA and other utilities have addressed this issue. The evaluation of utilities' compliance with opacity requirements is coming under increased scrutiny, especially during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction ("SSM"). Historically, SIPs developed under the CAA typically excluded periods of SSM, but in June 2015, EPA finalized a rule to eliminate such exclusions ("2015 Rule"). Environmental petitioners and several states filed petitions for judicial review of the 2015 Rule before the D.C. Circuit. On March 1, 2024, the D.C. Circuit determined that EPA exceeded its authority in removing the SSM exemptions from SIPs without showing the exemptions impede compliance with the CAA. TVA cannot predict the outcome of future SIP submittals in responding to the March 2024 decision of the D.C Circuit.

 New York Petition to Address Impacts from Upwind High Emitting Sources . In 2018, the State of New York filed a petition with EPA under Section 126(b) of the CAA to address ozone impacts on New York from the NO x emissions from sources emitting at least 400 tons of NO x in CY 2017 from nine states including Kentucky. The New York petition requests that EPA require daily NO x limits for several Kentucky utility units including the Shawnee units. Kentucky utility unit NO x emissions are already limited under CSAPR and are declining, and current EPA modeling projects that no additional requirements to reduce Kentucky NO x emissions are necessary. In 2019, EPA finalized its denial of New York's petition. The State of New York filed a petition in the D.C. Circuit for judicial review of EPA's denial of the petition, and in July 2020, the D.C. Circuit vacated EPA's denial of the petition and remanded the petition to EPA for reconsideration. Specific impacts to TVA cannot be determined until EPA takes further action on the petition. 
 
 GHG Emissions. On May 9, 2024, EPA published a final rule that (1) repeals the Affordable Clean Energy Rule addressing GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generation units EGUs ), (2) establishes guidelines for GHG emissions from existing fossil-fuel fired steam generating EGUs, (3) finalizes revisions to the New Source Performance Standards NSPS for GHG emissions from new and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbine EGUs, and (4) finalizes revisions to the NSPS for GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired steam generating EGUs that undertake a large modification. The degree of GHG emission reduction would depend on the EGU s retirement date, and the cost of such reductions would likely be substantial. TVA is still evaluating the potential impact of the rule on its new natural gas-fired EGUs, but the impact would also likely be substantial. Provisions of the rule addressing GHG emissions from base load natural gas-fired EGUs would apply to new combined cycle ("CC") gas plants at which construction commenced after May 23, 2023. Base load CC gas plants subject to the rule would be required by January 1, 2032, to control 90 percent of the GHG emissions, most likely through carbon capture and storage. EPA did not finalize guidelines for GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbine EGUs in this rulemaking. The rule is subject to legal challenges. Under the new rule, TVA would be required to reduce GHG emissions from any coal-fired units that it continues to operate beyond January 1, 2032. 
 
 Climate Change 
 
 Emissions. Though many of TVA's facilities continue to emit air pollutants, emissions from all TVA-owned and operated units (including small CTs of less than 25 MW) have been reduced from historic peaks. Emissions of NO x and SO 2 began being regulated in 1995 and 1977, respectively. Emissions of NO x and SO 2 have been reduced by 97 percent and 99 percent, respectively, since their initial year of regulation.

 Notes 
 (1) Intensity rates are calculated based on generation from TVA's most recent fiscal year for years indicated and emissions data from the most recent CYs. 
 (2) Emissions data is consistent with Edison Electric Institute Environmental, Social, Governance, and Sustainability Report standards, which are based on metric tons ("MTs"), whereas overall CO 2 emission rates and baseline reductions from historical levels are based on short tons. 
 
 For CY 2023, TVA's emissions of carbon dioxide ("CO 2 ") from its owned and operated units, including purchased power and REC retirement adjustments which reduce the reportable CO 2 emissions, were 49 million tons, resulting in a TVA system average, as delivered, CO 2 emission rate of 625 lbs/MWh. This represents a 58 percent and 53 percent reduction in mass carbon emissions and TVA's carbon emission rate, respectively, from 2005 levels. 
 
 While TVA continues down the path of lowering emissions, including GHG emissions, there will be fluctuations in TVA's emission numbers as a result of various factors, including electricity usage in the Tennessee Valley and changes in the power supply mix, as TVA continues to make operational decisions to keep the system reliable and deliver low-cost energy. The achievement of TVA's carbon reduction efforts, and its ability to maintain system reliability during the transition to cleaner forms of energy, is subject to numerous risks. See Forward-Looking Information , and Item 1A, Risk Factors Operational Risks TVA may not be able to meet its carbon reduction aspirations, which may result in additional capital expenditures or higher operating expense. 
 
 Report on Climate-Related Risks . On December 30, 2022, the Government Accountability Office ("GAO") publicly released a report entitled Tennessee Valley Authority: Additional Steps Are Needed to Better Manage Climate-Related Risks . This report examines climate-related risks to TVA's operations and steps TVA has taken to manage climate-related risks as well 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 as additional steps needed. In the report, GAO made recommendations, including that TVA conduct an inventory of assets and operations vulnerable to climate change and develop a resilience plan that identifies and prioritizes resilience measures. 
 
 TVA provided a response to GAO in June 2023 outlining completed and planned TVA actions to address the recommendations. To strengthen TVA s climate resiliency, TVA has established new priority actions in TVA s Climate Adaptation Plan. Based on the information provided and the release of the 2024 Climate Adaptation Plan, GAO agreed to close all the recommendations on August 14, 2024. 
 
 Executive Actions. President Biden has taken several executive actions relating to climate change. 
 
 On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued EO 13990, "Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science To Tackle the Climate Crisis." EO 13990 directs federal agencies to review and revise regulations consistent with broad policy goals to improve public health and the environment, reduce GHG emissions, and prioritize environmental justice. In addition, EO 13990 re-established an Interagency Working Group and tasked it with identifying areas and other key decisions where agencies should consider the social cost of GHG, which is a modeled metric used to estimate damages that GHG causes across society. On September 21, 2023, President Biden announced that he approved recommendations from the Interagency Working Group on the expanded use of the social costs of GHG for budgeting, procurement, and other agency decisions, including reaffirming its use for environmental reviews where appropriate. 
 
 On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued EO 14008, "Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad." EO 14008 seeks to promote safe global temperatures, increase climate resilience, and support low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development by, among other things, (1) using federal procurement authorities to achieve or facilitate (a) a carbon pollution-free electricity sector no later than 2035 and (b) clean and zero-emission vehicles for federal, state, local, and tribal government fleets, (2) putting the U.S. on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050, and (3) establishing the Justice40 Initiative, instructing federal agencies to direct 40 percent of the benefit from eligible projects toward disadvantaged communities. 
 
 On May 20, 2021, President Biden issued EO 14030, Climate-Related Financial Risk, which calls for a governmental-wide strategy on the disclosure of climate-related financial risk that includes, among other things, the measurement, assessment, mitigation, and disclosure of climate-related financial risk to federal government programs, assets, and liabilities in order to increase the long-term stability of federal operations. 
 
 On December 8, 2021, President Biden issued EO 14057, "Executive Order on Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability," which details the administration s policy to take a whole-of-government approach to lead by example to achieve a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050. Implementing Instructions for EO 14057 issued in August 2022 provided instructions to federal agencies regarding agency planning, reporting requirements, and accountability. Agencies must issue or revise existing agency policies, directives, and guidance, as appropriate, including employee training, to ensure alignment with the goals and requirements of EO 14057. 
 
 On September 12, 2022, President Biden issued EO 14082, Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. EO 14082 provides that in implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, federal agencies shall, as appropriate and to the extent consistent with law, prioritize, among other things, (1) driving progress to achieve the climate goals of the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030, achieve a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035, and achieve net-zero emissions by no later than 2050, (2) advancing environmental and climate justice through an all-of-government approach, including through the Justice40 Initiative set forth in EO 14008, and (3) promoting construction of clean energy generation, storage, transmission, and enabling technologies through efficient, effective mechanisms that incorporate community engagement. 
 
 On April 21, 2023, President Biden issued EO 14096, Revitalizing Our Nation's Commitment to Environmental Justice for All. EO 14096, among other things, details the administration s policy to take a whole-of-government approach to environmental justice and to advance environmental justice by implementing and enforcing the nation s environmental and civil rights laws, preventing pollution, addressing climate change and its effects, and working to clean up legacy pollution that is harming human health and the environment. In addition, EO 14096 directs each federal agency to make achieving environmental justice part of its mission and to submit an environmental justice strategic plan to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality within 18 months of the date of the order and every four years thereafter. 
 TVA is voluntarily pursuing multiple policies and programs in the Tennessee Valley that support the goals and policies of these executive actions. See Actions Taken by TVA to Reduce GHG Emissions below. TVA must consider executive actions within the context of statutory requirements imposed by Congress when carrying out its mission such as the TVA Act, which requires power to be sold at rates as low as feasible, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which requires the use of least-cost resource planning. TVA performs long-term least-cost resource planning through its Integrated Resource Plan process.

 Paris Agreement . The U.S. is currently part of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement tracks emissions targets through nationally determined contributions ("NDCs"). Each nation that is a party to the Paris Agreement is asked to prepare five-year, successive NDCs that it plans to achieve. In April 2021, the Biden Administration announced its GHG NDCs for 2030 under the Paris Agreement, and these NDCs establish a new target for the U.S. to achieve a 50 to 52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG pollution in 2030. TVA's own operations have achieved GHG reductions from 2005 levels that are in excess of 50 to 52 percent. 
 
 Litigation . Climate change issues have been the subject of a number of lawsuits, including lawsuits against TVA, and TVA may be subject to additional lawsuits in the future. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings for additional information. 
 
 Indirect Consequences of Regulation or Business Trends . Legal, technological, political, and scientific developments regarding climate change may create new opportunities and risks. The potential indirect consequences could include an increase or decrease in electricity demand, increased demand for clean generation from alternative energy sources, and subsequent impacts to business reputation and public opinion. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources . 
 
 Physical Impacts of Climate Change. Physical impacts of climate change may include, but not be limited to, changing weather patterns, extreme weather conditions, and other events such as flooding, droughts, wildfires, heat waves, and snow or ice storms, and these events can impact TVA's system in terms of system operability, customer demand, and the health of regional economies. TVA updated its Climate Adaptation Plan in 2024. The goal of the action planning process is to ensure TVA continues to achieve its mission and program goals and to operate in a secure, effective, and efficient manner in a changing climate by integrating climate change adaptation efforts in coordination with state and local partners, tribal governments, and private stakeholders. TVA manages the risks proposed by climate change on its mission, programs, and operations within its environmental management processes, though such risks cannot be completely eliminated. 
 
 Actions Taken by TVA to Reduce GHG Emissions . TVA has reduced GHG emissions from both its generation facilities and its other operations. TVA Board actions have focused on further reducing GHG emissions from its generation fleet by evaluating the potential retirement of its coal-fired fleet, increasing its nuclear capacity, modernizing its hydroelectric generation system, increasing natural gas-fired generation to enable greater integration of renewables on the grid, increasing its purchases of renewable energy, building solar facilities, and investing in energy efficiency initiatives to reduce energy use in the Tennessee Valley. Additionally, TVA continues to invest in energy efficiency in its operations and offer renewable energy programs. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources Renewable Energy Resources . These changes support the broad electrification and carbon emission reduction efforts in other sectors of the economy. Also, TVA has partnered with the University of Tennessee Baker School for Public Policy and Public Affairs and with diverse stakeholders from across the Tennessee Valley to conduct a Valley Pathways Study, which is focused on building a competitive and clean economy for the Tennessee Valley. This study examines potential scenarios for all economic sectors across the Tennessee Valley that will support sustainable growth and a viable and preferred decarbonization pathway. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio . 
 
 There are inherent challenges each year in both operations and asset changes. TVA will not sacrifice reliability at any time, which means that TVA must make certain operational decisions at times to keep the system reliable, possibly impacting annual performance on carbon emissions. Therefore, while TVA continues to strive to lower GHG emissions, there will be fluctuations in TVA s emission numbers resulting from changes in the power supply mix, weather impacts, economic conditions, and generating unit performance. As TVA evolves its generation portfolio, and after appropriate environmental review under NEPA, the TVA Board could make decisions about the timing, retirement, and replacement of aging fossil units or other expiring capacity, which may further TVA s CO 2 and other emissions reductions. The Environmental Policy also provides additional direction in several environmental stewardship areas related to reducing environmental impacts on the Tennessee Valley's natural resources, including reducing carbon intensity and air emissions. In addition, TVA's decarbonization initiative is aimed at understanding and applying clean resources to support the reduction of carbon emissions from its power supply, and TVA is exploring several technologies as part of these efforts. See Research and Development above. 
 
 Renewable/Clean Energy Standards 
 
 Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have established enforceable or mandatory requirements for electric 
 utilities to generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources or have established a renewable goal. In 18 of those 
 states and the District of Columbia, the requirement is for a 100 clean electricity standard or goal by 2050 or earlier. One state within the TVA service area, North Carolina, has a mandatory renewable and clean energy goal that, while not applying directly to TVA, does apply to TVA's LPCs serving retail customers in that state. TVA's policy is to provide compliance assistance to any distributor of TVA power, and TVA is providing assistance to the covered LPCs that sell TVA power in North Carolina. In 2020, Virginia signed into law the Clean Economy Act. This act establishes a mandatory requirement for utilities to generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources. At this time, TVA is not impacted by the legislation due to the relatively small amount of electricity that TVA provides in Virginia compared to other utilities. Likewise, the Mississippi Public Service Commission adopted an energy efficiency rule applying to electric and natural gas providers in the state, and TVA is supplying information on participation in TVA's energy efficiency programs to support the covered Mississippi LPCs.

Water Quality Control Developments 
 
 Waters of the United States . On May 25, 2023, the Supreme Court in Sackett v. EPA narrowed the interpretation of the scope of waters of the United States under the CWA. Specifically, the Court ruled that CWA jurisdiction extends only to wetlands that have continuous surface connection with relatively permanent bodies of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters. In reaching its decision, the Court rejected the significant nexus standard for determining the jurisdiction of the CWA that was articulated by Justice Kennedy in the Court s Rapanos decision. The result of this decision is that fewer waters will be subject to CWA permitting or other restrictions. In response to the Sackett v. EPA decision, EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers ACE published a final rule in the Federal Register in September 2023 that reestablishes, for the third time, the definition of waters of the United States. The new definition encompasses fewer water bodies than the previous definition. As such, ACE permits will no longer be required for some streams and wetlands that would have been included based on the previous significant nexus standard. 
 
 Cooling Water Intake Structures. In 2014, EPA released a final rule under Section 316(b) of the CWA relating to cooling water intake structures ("CWIS") for existing power generating facilities. The rule requires changes in CWIS used to cool the vast majority of coal, gas, and nuclear steam-electric generating plants and a wide range of manufacturing and industrial facilities in the U.S. The final rule requires CWIS to reflect the best technology available ("BTA") for minimizing adverse environmental impacts, primarily by reducing the amount of fish and shellfish that are impinged or entrained at a CWIS. These new requirements will potentially affect a number of TVA's fossil-fueled and nuclear-fueled facilities and will likely require capital upgrades to ensure compliance. Most TVA facilities are projected to require retrofit of CWIS with "fish-friendly" screens and fish return systems to achieve compliance with the new rule. The rule is being implemented through permits issued under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") in Section 402 of the CWA. State agencies administer the NPDES permit program in most states including those in which TVA's facilities are located. In addition, the responsible state agencies must provide all permit applications to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for a 60-day review prior to public notice and an opportunity to comment during the public notice. As a result, the permit may include requirements for additional studies of threatened and endangered species arising from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service comments and may require additional measures to be taken to protect threatened and endangered species and critical habitats directly or indirectly related to the plant cooling water intake. TVA's review of the final rule indicates that the rule offers adequate flexibility for cost-effective compliance. The required compliance timeframe is linked to plant-specific NPDES permit renewal cycles (i.e., technology retrofits), and compliance activities have begun and are expected to continue through the 2028 - 2030 timeframe. These compliance activities include the requirement to conduct and submit studies on entrainment mortality, and these studies will be submitted as part of the permit renewal process. Using these studies, the state permitting agency will determine if the existing technology exhibits best technology or if alternative technology is required to achieve BTA. To address impingement mortality, a facility has 180 days after its reissued NPDES permit becomes effective to select impingement compliance options and submit a compliance schedule for implementation. A waiver from having to implement its impingement compliance requirements can be obtained if the facility will be retiring in the next five-year permit cycle. 
 
 EPA has never previously applied the requirements under Section 316(b) to hydroelectric facilities. However, in September 2021, EPA Region 10, which covers an area outside TVA s service area, issued NPDES permits to four hydroelectric plants that include Section 316(b) requirements. In determining the BTA to minimize adverse impacts on the environment using best professional judgment, Region 10 analyzed the existing controls that the hydroelectric facilities were already implementing and concluded that those controls constitute BTA. It is not clear whether this approach will be adopted nationwide or how the BTA standard would be applied to TVA's hydroelectric facilities; accordingly, the specific impacts to TVA from the Region 10 permits cannot be determined at this time. 
 
 Hydrothermal Discharges. EPA and many states continue to focus regulatory attention on potential effects of hydrothermal discharges. Many TVA plants have variances from thermal standards under Section 316(a) of the CWA that are subject to review as NPDES permits are renewed. Specific data requirements in the future will be determined based on negotiations between TVA and state regulators. If plant thermal limits are made more stringent, TVA may have to install cooling towers at some of its plants and operate installed cooling towers more often. This could result in a substantial cost to TVA. 
 
 Steam-Electric Effluent Guidelines . In October 2020, EPA issued final revised electric effluent limitations guidelines ("ELGs") for bottom ash transport water and FGD wastewater. The primary impact for TVA is on the operation of existing coal-fired generation facilities. The revision also includes a subcategory for which Cumberland would qualify that provides TVA greater flexibility in meeting the ELGs. The revision includes two additional subcategories for low utilization units and units that cease coal combustion by the end of CY 2028. In October 2021, TVA filed notices of planned participation preserving the option for TVA's Bull Run, Cumberland, and Kingston plants to participate in the subcategory for units that cease coal combustion by the end of CY 2028. 
 
 On May 9, 2024, EPA issued final steam ELGs. This rule is expected to significantly impact wastewater treatment options at coal combustion facilities with waste streams that operate past 2028. This rule establishes more stringent technology-based effluent limitations for four waste streams: flue gas desulfurization FGD wastewater, bottom ash transport water BATW ), combustion residual leachate CRL ), and legacy wastewater. The rule also establishes a new subcategory for CRL called unmanaged CRL, which includes discharges of CRL that the permitting authority determines are the functional equivalent 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 of direct discharges of CRL or groundwater that meets the definition of CRL that is pumped to the surface and discharged to the waters of the United States. The 2024 ELGs are based on performance of specific technologies applied to these wastewaters. The rule establishes a general applicability category and a 2034 retirement subcategory for existing coal generation and retains the 2028 retirement subcategory and voluntary incentives program from the 2020 rule. The 2024 rule is likely to affect TVA s operating fossil sites, including Kingston, Cumberland, Gallatin, and Shawnee, and imposes additional reporting requirements for Bull Run. Additionally, this rule could impact any sites with CRL that have repowered or in the future could repower with steam electric generation. TVA is evaluating the applicability of this rule on all facilities as appropriate. Currently, the rule is subject to legal challenges. If the challenges are not successful, TVA could incur substantial costs to comply with the rule. 
 
 In 2021, TVA submitted requests to state regulatory authorities to modify NPDES permits for Kingston, Cumberland, Bull Run, Shawnee, and Gallatin Fossil Plant ("Gallatin") to incorporate into the permits limitations in EPA's 2020 rule. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation ("TDEC") issued a final permit for Cumberland in the first quarter of 2024. In addition, consistent with the 2024 rule, on August 6, 2024, TVA submitted requests to state regulatory authorities to modify NPDES permits for Kingston, Cumberland, Shawnee, and Gallatin to incorporate into the permits limitations in EPA's 2024 rule. 
 
 Other Water Quality Control Requirements . As is the case in other industrial sectors, TVA and other utilities are also facing more stringent requirements related to drinking water standards, including new limits and requirements for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, the protection of wetlands, reductions in storm water impacts from construction activities, new water quality criteria for nutrients and other pollutants, new wastewater analytical methods, and changes in regulation of pesticide application. 
 
 Cleanup of Solid and Hazardous Wastes 
 
 TVA Sites. Historical operations by TVA and other entities at certain facilities have resulted in releases of contaminants that TVA is addressing, including at TVA's Environmental Research Center at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. TVA has completed several removal, remedial, and characterization actions at the site, as required by a RCRA permit issued by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management ("ADEM"). On September 30, 2024, TVA's estimated liability for required cleanup and similar environmental work for those sites for which sufficient information was available to develop a cost estimate was approximately 15 million and was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ADEM issued a renewed permit to TVA in July 2023, with a 10-year term. The new permit will not have any adverse impacts on TVA. In addition, the Environmental Research Center has an active groundwater monitoring program as part of a permitted corrective action plan. 
 
 Non-TVA Sites. TVA is aware of alleged hazardous-substance releases at certain non-TVA areas for which it may have some liability. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Environmental Matters . 
 
 Coal Combustion Residuals. EPA published its final rule governing CCR in 2015. The rule regulates CCR as nonhazardous waste under Subtitle D of RCRA and establishes standards for landfill and surface impoundment placement, design, operation, and closure; groundwater monitoring; corrective action; and post-closure care. The initial version of the rule provided for self-implementation by utilities and allowed enforcement through citizen suits in federal court. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act subsequently allowed state or federal-based permitting to implement EPA's CCR rule ("CCR Rule") instead of self-implementation. In 2020, EPA issued the final Part A revision to its CCR Rule. Among other things, the final Part A rule requires unlined CCR surface impoundments to stop receiving CCR and non-CCR wastestreams and to initiate closure or retrofit by no later than April 11, 2021. TVA ceased sending CCR and non-CCR wastestreams to, and initiated closure of, unlined CCR surface impoundments by the specified deadline. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Coal Combustion Residuals Coal Combustion Residuals Facilities for a discussion of the impact on TVA's operations, including the cost and timing estimates of related projects. 
 
 On May 8, 2024, EPA published its final legacy CCR Rule ("Legacy CCR Rule"), which expands the scope of the existing regulatory requirements of the 2015 CCR Rule to include two additional classes of CCR units: Legacy Surface Impoundments Legacy SIs and Coal Combustion Residual Management Units CCRMUs ). Legacy SIs include inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities that were exempt from the 2015 CCR Rule. CCRMUs are a newly defined category that includes previously unregulated areas at CCR facilities where CCR was beneficially reused in an unencapsulated manner, disposed, placed, or managed on land outside of CCR units regulated by the 2015 CCR Rule. TVA completed applicability reports for multiple Legacy SIs by the November 8, 2024 deadline and as authorized by regulation is still evaluating whether other CCR units might constitute Legacy SIs. For CCRMUs, TVA must complete the initial round of facility evaluation reports by February 8, 2026, and the subsequent round by February 8, 2027. During 2024, TVA recorded additional estimated AROs of 3.1 billion as a result of EPA's Legacy CCR Rule and recorded a corresponding regulatory asset of 3.1 billion due to these AROs being associated with closed sites and asset retirement costs having been fully depreciated. These amounts are forward-looking and are subject to various uncertainties, and actual amounts may differ materially based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the outcome of legal challenges to the Legacy CCR Rule, ongoing evaluations of the number and scope of newly regulated units, and determinations on final closure requirements and performance standards. See Forward-Looking Information and Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of additional factors. Revisions to the additional estimated non- 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 nuclear AROs from the Legacy CCR Rule will be made whenever factors indicate that the timing or amounts of estimated cash flows have changed. See also Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligations . In addition, EPA has recently interpreted its CCR Rule in a way that could challenge TVA's predominant closure methodology for many units, thereby potentially creating significant additional costs with implementing closure. 
 
 In August 2015, TDEC issued an order that includes an iterative process through which TVA and TDEC will investigate, assess, and remediate any unacceptable risks resulting from CCR management and disposal at TVA CCR units in the State of Tennessee. As part of this process, TVA has submitted environmental assessment reports EARs to TDEC, and after the EARs are approved, TVA will submit Corrective Action/Risk Assessment CARA Plans that will identify the unacceptable risks and TVA's proposed remediation. TDEC will review the CARA Plans and provide comments, and TVA will make revisions to address TDEC's comments until TDEC approves a final CARA Plan for each site. The public also will have an opportunity to review and comment on each CARA Plan prior to TDEC's approval of the final plan. During 2024, TDEC approved EARs for John Sevier, Cumberland, Kingston, Allen, and Watts Bar, and TVA submitted initial drafts of the CARA Plans for John Sevier, Cumberland, Allen, Watts Bar, and Kingston. TVA also submitted an initial draft of the Gallatin Ash Pond Complex CARA Plan to TDEC in January 2024 pursuant to a consent order and agreement. See Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Coal Combustion Residuals Coal Combustion Residual Facilities for a discussion of the Gallatin Ash Pond Complex. As discussed above, revisions of these initial draft CARA Plans will continue through the iterative process until the final plans are approved. 
 
 In October 2019, TDEC released amendments to its regulations which govern solid waste disposal facilities, including TVA's active CCR facilities covered by a solid waste disposal permit and those which closed pursuant to a TDEC-approved closure plan. Such facilities are generally subject to a 30-year post-closure care period during which the owner or operator must undertake certain activities, including monitoring and maintaining the facility. The amendments, among other things, add an additional 50-year period after the end of the post-closure care period, require TVA to submit recommendations as to what activities must be performed during this 50-year period to protect human health and the environment, and require TVA to submit revised closure plans every 10 years. 
 Groundwater Impacts Associated with CCR Management Activities . There is increased attention among EPA, environmental groups, and state regulatory agencies on impacts to groundwater associated with CCR management activities. As a result, TVA may be required to change how it manages CCR at some of its plants, potentially resulting in higher costs. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Coal Combustion Residuals Coal Combustion Residuals Facilities and Allen Groundwater Investigation and Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligations. 
 Environmental Investments 
 From 1970 to 2024, TVA spent approximately 6.8 billion on controls to reduce emissions from its coal-fired power plants, including 28 million, 25 million, and 16 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, on clean air controls. In addition, TVA has reduced emissions by idling or retiring coal-fired units and relying more on cleaner energy resources including natural gas and nuclear generation and renewable sources. 
 TVA currently anticipates spending significant amounts on environmental projects in the future, including investments in new clean energy generation including renewables to reduce TVA's overall environmental footprint. TVA environmental project expenditures could also result from coal-fired plant decommissioning and from effective ash management modernization. Based on TVA's decisions regarding certain coal-fired units, the amount and timing of expenditures could change. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources Coal-Fired above and Estimated Required Environmental Expenditures below. 
 SO 2 Emissions and NO x Emissions. To reduce SO 2 emissions, TVA operates scrubbers on 17 of its coal-fired units and switched to lower-sulfur coal at certain coal-fired units. To reduce NO x emissions, TVA operates SCRs on 18 coal-fired units, operates low-NO x burners or low-NO x combustion systems on 20 units, optimized combustion on all 24 units, and operates NO x control equipment year round when units are operating (except during start-up, shutdown, and maintenance periods). TVA has also retired 35 of 59 coal-fired units. In 2024, TVA constructed an SCR on Shawnee Unit 7 and is constructing SCRs at three additional Shawnee Units by the end of 2025. TVA is evaluating plans for the remaining units. Except for six units at Shawnee, the remaining coal-fired units in the TVA fleet have scrubbers and SCRs. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources Coal-Fired above. 
 
 Particulate Emissions. To reduce particulate emissions of air pollutants, TVA has equipped all of its coal-fired units with scrubbers, mechanical collectors, electrostatic precipitators, and/or bag houses. 
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions . Various federal agencies, including EPA and the Department of Commerce, may issue regulations establishing more stringent air and waste requirements, as well as GHG accounting requirements, and these requirements could result in significant changes in the structure of the U.S. power industry, especially in the eastern half of the country. There could be additional material costs if further reductions of GHGs, including CO 2 , are mandated by legislative, executive, regulatory, or judicial actions and if more stringent emission reduction requirements for conventional pollutants are established. These costs cannot reasonably be predicted at this time because of the uncertainty of these actions.

Human Capital Management 
 
 People Strategy and TVA's Values 
 
 The employees of TVA continued to advance TVA s unique mission and business goals to create an environment that supports and responds to the changing needs of its workforce, using People Advantage and four other Strategic Priorities (Operational Excellence, Financial Strength, Powerful Partnerships, and Igniting Innovation) to help create a culture that lives up to its values. 
 
 Paramount to TVA's focus on human capital and its People Advantage priority are three specific pillars: (1) Inclusion with Diversity ("IwD"), (2) Talent, and (3) Engagement, all of which are briefly highlighted below. To help shape an inclusive work environment that values all voices, TVA has intensified its efforts over the past few years to integrate IwD into its culture and make its efforts and progress sustainable and a part of TVA's daily operations. 
 
 Inclusion with Diversity 
 
 TVA recognizes inclusion as a journey, not a destination, and has continued to make significant strides throughout 2024 by acknowledging that its people bring more to the workplace than simply skills. Looking ahead, TVA and its industry will face challenging new technologies, customer expectations, and environmental requirements. 
 
 TVA further illustrates its commitment to employees and communities by championing Employee Resource Groups and various diversity councils across TVA. Diversity Impact Awards also reflect the effectiveness of TVA s diversity efforts, which extend outside of TVA. 
 
 Talent 
 
 Attracting and Retaining Talent. The strength of TVA lies in the collective power from the diverse knowledge, experiences, and perspectives that its employees bring from a variety of backgrounds. TVA recruits talent primarily from across the Tennessee Valley region and utilizes a talent framework to deliver enterprise workforce needs supporting attraction, selection, development, engagement, and performance. TVA actively engages with key community and university partners to recruit talent in craft, engineering, information technology, and professional positions, and continues to improve employment opportunities and the talent pool within TVA s workforce through early career apprenticeships and internships. TVA's top majors for its intern population are engineering, computer science, data analytics, and business/finance. 
 
 Healthy Attrition. TVA s voluntary attrition rates continue to fall well below the national, utility, and government benchmarks, with the majority of TVA's attrition note d as healthy attrition (e.g., retirements). TVA believes this stability is critical to TVA s success in a complex and competitive work environment and among a highly skilled workforce. 
 
 Competitive Total Rewards. TVA s total rewards package is a significant factor in attracting and retaining top talent. TVA provides market-based and competitive compensation and benefits, which includes an annual incentive plan (extended to all eligible employees, including TVA's represented employee population). Additionally, in support of its cultural commitment to IwD, 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 TVA periodically reviews and monitors compensation pay practices to promote fairness and equity and continues to provide leaders with tools to assist in making equitable pay decisions. 
 
 Development and Training. As TVA continues to adapt to the evolving demands of the industry, it seeks to motivate people to do their best work by aligning employee development, skills, and capabilities with what TVA needs to succeed now and in the future. TVA provides individual and team training opportunities as well as development opportunities for all employee levels. In-person and online learning events are offered and encouraged, and TVA also provides tuition reimbursement opportunities for academic programs aligned with TVA s business and workforce development needs. 
 
 Leadership Development and Succession Planning. TVA encourages and motivates employees to seek development and leadership opportunities. With the assistance of TVA s talent review and succession planning program, 91 percent of director and executive level roles have at least one succession candidate identified and at least one ready-now succession candidate. A continuous focus on and support of leadership development has helped TVA meet or exceed established goals for female and people of color representation in leadership. TVA believes that its strength lies in the collective power from the diverse knowledge, experiences, and perspectives that its employees bring. To inspire the best from its people, TVA utilizes a talent management framework to deliver enterprise workforce needs supporting talent attraction, selection, development, engagement, and performance. 
 
 Engagement 
 
 Strong engagement levels impact all TVA strategic priorities. TVA s employee engagement survey is administered a minimum of annually to all employees and measures overall engagement and drivers of engagement. Results from the surveys are shared with employees and used by TVA leadership and business units to improve and monitor progress against People Advantage objectives. 
 
 Safety and Employee Health. Safety is one of TVA s core values. TVA's safety program is based on the fundamentals of a safety management system, which includes management commitment, employee engagement, hazard recognition and control, worksite analysis, contractor safety management, training, review, and continuous improvement. Further, management illustrates its commitment to human capital by including a safety metric in its incentive compensation metrics that tracks the serious injury incident rate and applies to all eligible participants in TVA s annual program. A keen focus on safety helps TVA maintain top quartile ranking in workforce engagement, top quartile serious injury performance, and a clear link to other key areas such as IwD. 
 
 Partnerships with Unions. TVA has a long-standing policy of acknowledging and working with recognized representatives of its employees, and that policy is reflected in long-term agreements to recognize the unions (or their successors) that represent TVA employees. 
 
 TVA s labor strategy is critical to the achievement of its strategic priorities as it prepares the workforce for the future. Its employees are represented by six collective bargaining agreements and nine labor unions. This reflects 57 percent of TVA's internal workforce, or approximately 6,000 employees. With the addition of collective bargaining agreements and labor unions for TVA's contractors, there are a total of nine collective bargaining agreements and 17 labor unions. TVA s partnerships with these unions go back more than 80 years and form the backbone of TVA and its ability to serve the people of the Tennessee Valley. 
 
 Ethics 
 
 Ethics and integrity have been highly valued and essential elements of TVA's culture since TVA's establishment in 1933. TVA's Ethics Compliance ("E C") office aims to help employees make the right decisions when the right decisions may not be clear. TVA requires all employees and certain contractors to take annual ethics training and attest to a code of conduct, which sets forth standards for adhering to core values and conducting its affairs with openness, honesty, and integrity every day. In response to these efforts and a review by Ethisphere , TVA became the first federal agency to receive the Compliance Leader Verification TM ("CLV") certification, applicable for 2022-2023. In December 2023, TVA received its second consecutive certification from Ethisphere , applicable for 2024-2025, and remains the only federal agency to have received the CLV certification at this time. 
 
 Key Metrics 
 
 TVA actively monitors internal metrics to remain aware of human capital trends and to strive to ensure that it is making measurable progress on its People Advantage objectives. Through monitoring sources such as data and performance dashboards, one-on-one engagements between leaders and employees, and engagement surveys, TVA obtains information that helps it understand its performance and make adjustments, as needed.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 The risk factors described below, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 (the "Annual Report"), should be carefully considered. Risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors could cause future results of TVA operations to differ materially from historical results as well as from the results anticipated in forward-looking statements. Although the risk factors described below are the ones that TVA considers material, additional risk factors that are not presently known to TVA or that TVA presently does not consider material may also impact TVA's business operations. See Forward Looking Information above for a description of some matters that could affect the below risks or generate new risks. The occurrence of any of the following could have a material adverse effect on TVA's cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 
 For ease of reference, the risk factors are presented in eight categories: (1) regulatory, legislative, and legal risks; (2) operational risks; (3) cybersecurity and information technology risks; (4) financial, economic, and market risks; (5) human capital and management risks; (6) risks related to the environment and catastrophic events; (7) accounting and financial reporting risks; and (8) general risk factors. 
 
 REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE, AND LEGAL RISKS 
 
 TVA may become subject to additional environmental regulations or may be required to expend significant funds in the future to comply with current regulations. 
 
 Laws, regulations, orders, and their interpretation pose a threat of substantially increasing TVA's cost of operations, including through prompting the early retirement of generation facilities, requiring significant capital expenditures to reduce carbon emissions, or causing TVA to change its anticipated methodology for closing CCR facilities. Possible areas of future laws or regulations include, but are not limited to, CCR, GHGs, ELGs, water quality, air quality, renewable energy portfolio standards, and natural gas production and transmission. See Item 1, Business Environmental Matters Clean Air Act Programs and Regulations for a discussion of EPA's new greenhouse gas emission standards and guidelines and new Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, Item 1, Business Environmental Matters Water Quality Control Developments for a discussion of EPA's new effluent limitation guidelines, Item 1, Business Environmental Matters Cleanup of Solid and Hazardous Wastes Coal Combustion Residuals for a discussion of recent revisions to EPA's CCR Rule, and Item 1, Business Environmental Matters Climate Change Executive Actions for a discussion of recent executive actions regarding climate change. Litigation may affect the timing and requirements of new regulatory proposals or may indirectly affect TVA, potentially even when TVA is not involved. Failure to comply with environmental requirements can result in enforcement actions and litigation, which can lead to the imposition of significant civil liability, including fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, and/or temporary or permanent closure of non-compliant facilities. 
 
 New environmental laws, regulations, or orders may become applicable to TVA or the facilities it operates, and existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised, enforced, or reinterpreted in a way that adversely affects TVA. EPA's recent regulations relating to closure of CCR facilities and EPA's revised interpretation of CCR regulations are pertinent examples. These rules will likely require TVA to incur significant additional costs with implementing closure, subject to the completion of any required environmental investigations or studies and any required approval of appropriate state regulators. TVA expects that these costs will substantially increase constraints related to TVA s debt ceiling and increase risks related to, among other things, (1) maintaining TVA s desired mix of generation assets, (2) meeting TVA s carbon-reduction aspirations, and (3) operating TVA's assets or their supporting infrastructure in a manner TVA considers most efficient, each of which is discussed below in these Risk Factors. 
 
 Complicating these matters further, over the last several decades, U.S. Administrations have increasingly relied on regulations and executive orders to implement environmental policies and objectives in the absence of Congressional agreement regarding new legislation. This condition, which creates instability and unpredictability of environmental regulations, seems likely to persist and could increase due to apparent polarization between the two main political parties. As a result, TVA often must comply with and otherwise adapt to environmental regulations without assurance of their continued effect. TVA often does not have the ability to anticipate, or prepare in advance for, changes in regulatory approaches that may be implemented following a change in Administration. 
 
 The Supreme Court s recent decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo overturned the Court s longstanding deferral to the applicable agency s interpretation of regulations. TVA is unable to predict whether, or to what extent, this decision will alter the outcome of judicial reviews of current or future regulations. TVA does not know whether risks related to current and future regulations affecting TVA will be significantly mitigated by the decision in Loper Bright . 
 
 New, existing, or amended laws, regulations, and administrative or executive orders, or congressional actions or inactions, create certain risks due to unique aspects of TVA s structure and business. 
 
 TVA is subject to significant laws, regulations, and orders under federal law, including some that do not apply to private electric companies. The cost of complying with these laws, regulations, and orders is substantial, and costs could be 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 significantly more than TVA anticipates, especially concerning environmental and nuclear compliance. In addition, TVA is required to obtain numerous regulatory permits and approvals from governmental agencies, and a failure to timely obtain desired approvals or to comply with any law, regulation, or order may cause TVA to change how it operates certain assets or pay fines for continuing to operate the assets. Moreover, since states are sometimes authorized to implement environmental programs so long as they implement the minimum federal standards in compliance, performance, and enforcement, TVA is often required to work with state agencies and officials in numerous jurisdictions to ensure compliance. Amendments to existing laws or future additional laws, regulations, and administrative or executive orders present additional risks, the occurrence of which is likely increased due to the potential for stakeholder activism. Further, federal administrative or executive orders could induce TVA to change the way it conducts its business. See Item 1, Business Environmental Matters Climate Change Executive Actions for a discussion of recent executive actions regarding climate change. Furthermore, Congress could act or fail to act on various issues that may impact TVA, including but not limited to action or inaction related to the national debt ceiling or automatic spending cuts in government programs. 
 
 In addition, Congress may pass laws in the future specifically applicable to TVA. These may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 A divestment or forced sale of TVA assets, which could trigger change of control provisions in certain material contracts, in addition to other costs and potential business disruptions; 
 A revocation of the TVA Board s sole authority to set electricity rates under the TVA Act, which could result in material adverse impacts on TVA s ability to meet financial obligations; 
 A restriction on TVA accessing or controlling its funds that are on deposit in its U.S. Treasury account; 
 A lowering of TVA s debt ceiling from the 30.0 billion outstanding provided for in the TVA Act, which could inhibit TVA s ability to raise capital necessary for essential business functions or for investing in carbon free technologies; 
 A restriction on TVA s authority to manage the Tennessee River system with power system operations, which could negatively impact TVA s operations of certain electric generation facilities; and 
 A limitation on TVA s ability to pay its CEO or other employees competitive wages, which could negatively impact TVA s ability to hire and retain talent needed to effectively fulfill TVA s mission. 
 
 Although it is difficult to predict new laws, regulations, or administrative or executive orders, or congressional action or inaction, or how such laws, regulations, orders, actions, or inactions may impact TVA, any resulting change could require TVA to make substantial additional capital expenditures or abandon certain projects, which could negatively affect TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 TVA's governmental status may interfere with its ability to quickly respond to the needs of its current or potential customers or to act solely in the interest of its ratepayers. 
 
 As a governmental entity, TVA has certain legal requirements that prevent it from responding as quickly to potential changes in the market or requests from current or potential customers as might be desired or in comparison to other utilities. For example, TVA is required to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"), which requires environmental reviews to be completed before TVA decides to pursue certain projects. The delay in responding to requests could damage relationships with current customers, deter potential customers from moving into TVA's service territory, or damage TVA's reputation. 
 
 TVA's nature as a governmental entity imposes additional pressures that most companies do not face, including most significantly the requirements to support economic development, simultaneously manage a river system for commerce, recreation, flood control, and power generation, and promote recreational opportunities within its service territory. 
 
 TVA funds these operations almost entirely from the sale of electricity. In addition, TVA must balance these obligations with the objective to provide power at the lowest feasible rates. If TVA does not adequately communicate how it fulfills its various missions and the value it provides, its reputation may be harmed, which may result in political pressure to change its nature or operations as well as in the loss of public support. 
 
 TVA is involved in various legal and administrative proceedings, the outcomes of which may affect TVA's finances and operations. 
 TVA is involved in a wide range of legal and administrative proceedings and is likely to become involved in future additional proceedings in the ordinary course of business or as a result of, among other things, catastrophic events or environmental conditions arising from TVA property or areas where TVA has disposed of materials or property. For a discussion of certain current material legal proceedings, see Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings . The additional proceedings could involve, among other things, challenges to TVA s CCR facilities, challenges to TVA's natural gas-fired plants and related pipelines, suits asserting nuisance claims under state law related to coal-fired plants, challenges to the anti-cherrypicking provision, challenges under NEPA, challenges under the Freedom of Information Act, and challenges to TVA s authority to set rates and enter into contracts. Although TVA cannot predict the outcome of the individual matters in which TVA is involved or will become involved, the resolution of 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 these matters could require TVA to make expenditures in excess of established reserves and in substantial amounts. Similarly, resolution of any such proceedings may require TVA to change its business practices or procedures, incur additional capital or operational expense, change how it operates its fossil-fueled units, cease construction of new natural gas-fired plants, reduce emissions to a greater extent or at a faster pace than TVA had planned, close existing CCR facilities sooner than planned, close existing CCR facilities using a different methodology than planned, build new CCR facilities sooner than planned, build new CCR facilities that were not planned, cease operation of some coal-fired units, adjust its rates, or terminate or modify contracts. These events individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on TVA s cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 TVA could lose its protected service territory. 
 
 TVA s service area is defined primarily by provisions of law and long-term contracts. The fence limits the region in which TVA or LPCs that distribute TVA power may provide power. The anti-cherrypicking provision precludes FERC from ordering TVA to transmit power for others if that power would be consumed within the TVA service area. State service territory laws limit unregulated third parties ability to sell electricity to consumers. From time to time, there have been efforts to circumvent the protection of the anti-cherrypicking provision. In addition, the protections afforded by the anti-cherrypicking provision conceivably could be affected by future federal legislation. If FERC were to limit the application of the anti-cherrypicking provision or if federal legislation were to eliminate or limit the application of the anti-cherrypicking provision without corresponding legislative modifications to the territorial limitations imposed by the fence, TVA could face increased competition and may lose some of its customers. 
 
 TVA may become subject to additional NERC requirements. 
 
 TVA is subject to federal reliability standards set forth by NERC and approved by FERC. TVA recognizes that reliability standards and expectations continue to become more complex and stringent for transmission systems. If TVA fails to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, TVA could be subject to increased compliance obligations, sanctions or both. Complying with these or additional requirements set forth by NERC may require significant capital expenditures and may negatively affect TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 OPERATIONAL RISKS 
 
 TVA's management and operation of CCR facilities expose it to additional costs and risks. 
 
 TVA operates coal-fired units that produce CCR as byproducts of the power production process. TVA manages CCR in dedicated, protective facilities operated by TVA. TVA has closed some of these facilities and is in the process of closing others. Many of these facilities do not have liners, as they were constructed prior to the requirement that such facilities be built with liners. TVA has been ordered by TDEC to undertake investigations at all CCR facilities in Tennessee. TVA has also been involved in litigation related to certain CCR facilities, and to resolve one such lawsuit, TVA agreed to remove or beneficially reuse significant amounts of CCR material at Gallatin Fossil Plant ("Gallatin"). TVA could be subject to similar litigation or orders in the future and could be required to restrict or stop the use of some or all CCR facilities that were not required to be closed by the CCR Rule or relocate CCR material to lined facilities. Further, TVA has decided to move all CCR material at Allen Fossil Plant rather than closing the CCR facilities in place as originally planned, which subjects TVA to additional costs and transportation-related risks. Moreover, EPA's new CCR rule will likely require TVA to incur significant additional costs with implementing closure, and EPA has recently interpreted its CCR rule in a way that could challenge TVA's predominant closure methodology for many units, thereby potentially creating significant additional costs with implementing closure. The ultimate resolution of matters relating to CCR obligations could have a material adverse effect on TVA's cash flows, results of operation, and financial condition. 
 
 TVA relies on certain assumptions about the future that may prove inaccurate, including when determining the appropriate mix of generation assets. 
 
 TVA uses certain assumptions that are presently justifiable to develop its future plans. Such assumptions include economic forecasts, anticipated energy and commodity prices, cost estimates, construction schedules, power demand forecasts, potential regulatory environments, and the appropriate generation mix to meet demand. Should these assumptions be inaccurate, or be superseded by subsequent events, TVA's plans may not be effective in achieving the intended results. In determining TVA s power generation assets should consist of a mix of nuclear, coal-fired, natural gas-fired, and renewable power sources, including hydroelectric, TVA considered various factors, including the anticipated availability of its nuclear units, the availability of non-nuclear facilities, the forecasted cost of natural gas and coal, the forecasted demand for electricity, its carbon reduction aspirations, and environmental compliance including the expense of adding air pollution controls to its coal-fired units. If any of these assumptions materially change or are impacted by subsequent events, TVA's generation mix may not address its operational needs in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. Additionally, reallocating the mix of power generation assets from the planned mix may result in additional capital and operational expense. Furthermore, achieving TVA's carbon reduction aspirations may require TVA to make significant capital investments, including investments in new technologies, and take a long time. TVA may retire coal-fired and natural-gas fired generation facilities sooner than planned to meet carbon reduction aspirations, which also may require significant capital expenditures or additional power purchases, potentially causing an adverse 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 effect on TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as TVA's ability to meet electricity demand. 
 
 TVA may not be able to meet its carbon reduction aspirations, which may result in additional capital expenditures or higher operating expense. 
 
 The achievement of TVA's carbon reduction aspirations, and its ability to maintain system reliability during the transition to cleaner forms of energy, is subject to numerous risks beyond TVA's control that are difficult to predict and may prevent TVA from timely achieving such aspirations. New federal laws could impose carbon reduction aspirations that are more aggressive and time-sensitive than TVA's plans. Occurrences that may prevent TVA from achieving its carbon reduction aspirations in a timely manner include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 Federal law or policy could restrict TVA's ability to use natural gas or nuclear power, which are each essential for TVA to reduce its carbon emissions. 
 TVA may not receive timely approval from federal and state regulators for construction and operation of new natural gas assets and attendant infrastructure (e.g., pipelines). 
 TVA may have difficulty obtaining resources or labor needed to complete projects on time and within budget. 
 Legal challenges may slow or restrict TVA's ability to replace coal generation with cleaner forms of energy. These challenges may, for instance, come in the form of direct legal challenges to TVA projects or through challenges to TVA's environmental reviews or the attempts of TVA or third parties to obtain necessary licenses and permits. 
 Potential delays in projects, along with now-anticipated load growth, may force TVA to rely on coal-fired generation more heavily, or longer, than it had previously projected. 
 As to TVA's longer term carbon reduction aspirations, the development of new technologies necessary to meet these aspirations may not occur as quickly, feasibly, or cost-effectively as necessary. 
 TVA's unique federal least-cost planning obligations may prevent TVA from moving forward with carbon-free generation as quickly as utilities that do not have the same requirements. 
 
 TVA may experience delays and incur additional costs in its major projects or may be unable to obtain necessary regulatory approval for them. 
 
 Among other projects, TVA is building new natural gas-fired generation facilities, seeking to improve the reliability and resiliency of its transmission system, undertaking repairs at certain hydroelectric facilities and dams, and closing some coal-fired plants and their supporting infrastructure. These activities involve risks of overruns in the cost of labor and materials, as well as potential delays, in beginning or completing these repairs, closures, or other projects. Further cancellation or delay of projects related to these activities may adversely affect TVA's cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. Such cancellation or delays may result from, among other things, changes in market conditions, changes in laws or regulations, unanticipatedly high environmental remediation costs, lack of productivity, human error, supply chain challenges, regional health emergencies, the failure to schedule activities properly, TVA's inability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or licenses, TVA's decision to cancel construction of a facility or cancel another type of project, including due to delays, cost overruns, changes in customer preferences, or changes in requirements applicable to how TVA conducts construction, repair, or closure activities. Further, if projects are not completed according to specifications, TVA may suffer, among other things, delays in receiving licenses, reduced plant efficiency, reduced transmission system integrity and reliability, and higher operating costs. 
 
 TVA faces certain risks arising solely from its operation of nuclear units. 
 
 TVA has seven operating nuclear units. Unique risks associated with these units include the following: 
 
 Hazard Risks . Hazards exist with the use of radioactive material in energy production, including management, handling, storage, and disposal. Further, a nuclear incident at one of TVA's facilities could have significant consequences including loss of life, damage to the environment, damage to or loss of the facility, and damage to non-TVA property. Although TVA carries certain types of nuclear insurance, the amount that TVA is required to pay in connection with a nuclear incident could significantly exceed the amount of coverage provided by insurance. The licensee of each nuclear reactor has a contingent obligation to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary level, regardless of proximity to the incident of fault, up to a maximum of approximately 166 million per reactor, per incident. With TVA's seven reactors, the maximum total contingent obligation per incident is 1.2 billion. This retrospective premium is payable at a maximum rate currently set at approximately 25 million per year, per incident, per reactor. In addition, following an incident TVA may have to pay retrospective insurance premiums, and may experience a reduction in the availability of nuclear insurance, an increase in the cost of nuclear insurance, an increase in the costs of operating nuclear units, or increased regulation or restrictions on the construction, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. Moreover, federal legislation could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims exceeding the limit for a single incident under the Price-Anderson Act. Further, the availability or price of insurance may be impacted by TVA's acts or omissions, such as a failure to properly maintain a facility, or events outside of TVA's control, such 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 as an equipment manufacturer's inability to meet a guideline, specification, or requirement. 
 
 Decommissioning Costs . TVA maintains a Nuclear Decommissioning Trust ("NDT") for the purpose of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The NDT is invested in securities generally designed to achieve a return in line with overall equity and debt market performance. TVA might have to make unplanned contributions to the NDT if, among other things: 
 
 The value of the investments in the NDT declines significantly or the investments fail to achieve the assumed real rate of return; 
 The decommissioning funding requirements are changed by law or regulation; 
 The assumed real rate of return on plan assets, which is currently five percent, is lowered by the TVA Board or the actual real rate of return does not achieve the assumed rate; 
 The actual costs of decommissioning are more than planned, including as a result of inflation; 
 Changes in technology and experience related to decommissioning cause decommissioning cost estimates to increase significantly; 
 TVA is required to decommission a nuclear plant sooner than it anticipates; or 
 The NRC guidelines for calculating the minimum amount of funds necessary for decommissioning activities are materially changed. 
 
 If TVA were to have to make additional contributions to the NDT, the contributions may negatively affect TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Regulatory Risks . The NRC has broad authority to adopt regulations related to the licensing, operating, and decommissioning of nuclear generation facilities and may adopt regulations as a result of events that occur at nuclear facilities in the U.S. or throughout the world. These regulations can result in significant restrictions or requirements on TVA. To comply with existing, new, or modified regulations, TVA may be required to make substantial capital expenditures at its nuclear plants or make substantial contributions to the NDT. In addition, if TVA were to fail to comply with requirements promulgated by the NRC, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down units, or modify, suspend, or revoke TVA's operating licenses. Moreover, the NRC may not approve future requests from TVA to extend the operating licenses for its nuclear units. 
 
 Waste Disposal. TVA's nuclear operations produce various types of nuclear waste materials, including spent fuel. TVA has been storing the spent fuel in accordance with NRC regulations in anticipation that a final storage site for all such waste will be developed and put in operation by the U.S. government. If no such site is forthcoming or if no alternative disposal or reuse plan is developed, TVA might be required to arrange for the safe and permanent disposal of the spent fuel itself. Such a requirement would cause TVA to incur substantial expense, including substantial capital expenditures, and could cause TVA to change how it operates its nuclear plants. 
 
 Availability of Components. Nuclear facilities require specialized components and access to intellectual property for operation. As the number of reliable suppliers of such components decreases and access to intellectual property is reduced, the availability of the components and access to the intellectual property also will likely decrease. If TVA were unable to secure either the original components, intellectual property, or replacements approved for use by the NRC, TVA might have to change how it conducts its operations, which may result in substantial expense. Further, limitations on global trade resulting from future and past pandemics and global conflicts, or other limitations on global shipping, such as international trade restrictions or sanctions, could materially decrease the availability or increase the cost of necessary or desired equipment. 
 
 Cost of Nuclear Fuel. The relatively low cost of nuclear fuel per megawatt of production is a primary justification for the relatively high costs of developing and constructing nuclear facilities. Future constraints on the availability of nuclear fuel could cause the cost of operating these facilities to be materially higher than expected. Such constraints could arise from, among other things, increased demand from greater adoption of nuclear power by TVA and other domestic and global electric suppliers, global conflicts, and/or limitations on global trade and global shipping. 
 
 TVA may not be able to operate one or more of its nuclear power units. 
 
 If operating issues were to develop with TVA nuclear power units that were not correctable, TVA may choose to shut down one or more units or be ordered to do so by the NRC. Returning the unit(s) to operation could be a lengthy and expensive process, or might not be feasible depending on circumstances. In either case, TVA's cash flows, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation may be negatively affected. The inability to operate all of TVA's nuclear units may cause TVA to rely more on forms of generation that produce more carbon, thus making it more difficult for TVA to meet its carbon reduction aspirations or meet reliability goals.

Physical attacks, threats, or other interference could damage or interfere with TVA's facilities and operations. 
 
 TVA has an extensive generation and transmission system and supporting infrastructure that includes, among other things, TVA's generation facilities and transmission infrastructure such as substations, towers, and control centers. Some of TVA's hydroelectric facilities include navigation locks for commerce along the Tennessee River system. TVA also operates flood control dams and supporting infrastructure. Because of TVA's status as a government corporation and TVA's role as the primary power provider for its service territory, individuals, groups, or nation states may target TVA with physical attacks or threats of such attacks. Events such as war, armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, or similar disruptive events may increase the risks of these attacks targeting critical physical infrastructure in the U.S. 
 
 Although TVA's operations are protected by automated monitoring systems, TVA Police and Emergency Management, TVA employees, local law enforcement, or a combination thereof, it may not be possible to effectively deter or prevent such attacks. These attacks could pose health and safety risks, significantly disable or destroy TVA assets, interfere with TVA's operations, result in additional regulatory or security requirements or litigation, increase the costs of nuclear licensing or compliance, and otherwise negatively affect TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, following a physical attack or threat, TVA may incur increased costs for added security measures, including additional physical plant security and security personnel, increased capability, or other necessary measures. 
 
 TVA's assets or their supporting infrastructure may not operate as planned. 
 
 Many of TVA's assets, including generation, transmission, navigation, and flood control assets, have been operating for several decades and have been in nearly constant service since they were completed. As such, they require regular maintenance, repair, and replacement in order to continue uninterrupted operation. Additionally, certain of TVA's newer assets utilize advanced technology that could experience technical or operating issues. The failure of TVA's assets or supporting infrastructure, including information technology systems, to perform as planned may cause health, safety, or environmental problems and may even result in events such as the failure of a dam, the inability to maintain a reservoir at the normal or expected level, or an incident at a coal-fired, gas-fired, or nuclear plant or a CCR facility. If these assets or their supporting infrastructure were to fail to operate as planned, if necessary repairs or upgrades were delayed or could not be completed as quickly as anticipated, or if necessary spare parts were unavailable, TVA: 
 
 May have to invest a significant amount of resources to repair or replace the assets or the supporting infrastructure; 
 May have to remediate collateral damage caused by a failure of the assets or the supporting infrastructure; 
 May not be able to maintain the integrity or reliability of the generation or transmission system at normal levels; 
 May have to operate less economical sources of power; 
 May have to purchase replacement power on the open market at prices greater than its generation costs; 
 May be required to invest substantially to meet more stringent reliability standards; 
 May be unable to maintain insurance on affected facilities, may be required to pay higher premiums for coverage, or may have to make certain repairs or upgrades to maintain insurance or to avoid higher premiums; 
 May be unable to operate the assets for a significant period of time or in the same manner as previously operated; and/or 
 May not be able to meet its contractual obligations to deliver power. 
 
 Any of these potential outcomes, among other things, may negatively affect TVA's cash flows, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. 
 
 TVA's operations present significant safety risks that are not able to be completely eliminated. 
 
 TVA's safety program, no matter how well designed and operated, may not completely prevent accidents. In addition to the potential human cost of accidents, which could include injury to employees or members of the public, significant accidents could impact TVA's ability to carry out operations, cause it to shut down facilities, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose it to litigation, damage its reputation, interfere with its ability to attract or retain a skilled workforce, or harm its financial condition. The aging of TVA's physical infrastructures and systems may increase the risk of accidents, especially if not properly maintained. 
 
 TVA's service reliability could be affected by problems at other utilities or at TVA facilities, or by the increase in intermittent sources of power. 
 
 TVA's transmission facilities are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of neighboring utilities and are thus part of the larger interstate power transmission grid. Certain of TVA's generation and transmission assets are critical to maintaining reliability of the transmission system. Additionally, TVA uses assets that belong to third parties to transmit power and maintain reliability. Accordingly, problems at other utilities as well as at TVA's facilities, including disruptions or black-outs caused by an event such as a severe storm, generator or transmission facility outage on a neighboring system, or the actions of a neighboring utility, may cause interruptions in TVA's service to its customers, 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 increase congestion on the transmission grid, or reduce service reliability. The increasing installation of intermittent sources of power, such as wind and solar, as well as the retirement of coal-fired plants, may place additional strain on TVA's and neighboring systems, and additional transmission upgrades may be required to maintain reliability. Upgrades may include enhancements to existing lines and substations or new installations as necessary to provide adequate power transmission capacity, maintain voltage support, and ensure generating plant and transmission system stability. 
 
 TVA's supplies of fuel, purchased power, or other critical items may be disrupted or obtained at a higher cost than planned. 
 
 TVA purchases coal, uranium, natural gas, fuel oil, and electricity from a number of suppliers. TVA contracts for conversion of uranium into nuclear fuel and purchases other items, such as anhydrous ammonia, liquid oxygen, or replacement parts that are critical to the operation of certain generation assets. TVA also purchases power from other power producers when the purchase of such power is appropriate due to economic opportunities or operational concerns. TVA's reliance on purchased power may increase if the demand for power increases in TVA's service territory, and purchased power may become more costly, or perhaps be unavailable, if the demand for power also increases in surrounding service territories. Examples of circumstances that may disrupt, or materially increase the cost of, the future delivery of fuel, purchased power, contracted services, or other critical supplies include but are not limited to cyber attacks; war or physical attacks, including the wars in Ukraine and Israel; political developments, international trade restrictions or tariffs, or legal actions; mine closures or reduced mine production; increase in demand for power by other power systems which reduces the amount of power that is available for purchase by TVA; increases in fuel exports; environmental regulations affecting TVA's suppliers; transportation or delivery constraints; the failure of suppliers to timely deliver the services or supplies to TVA at budgeted costs due to force majeure events, forced outages not caused by force majeure events, opportunistic non-performance or intentional defaults by suppliers; shortages of raw materials; supply chain difficulties; increased cost of components and labor; strikes or work stoppages; inflation; availability of personnel being impacted by regional health emergencies; or similar events. 
 
 If one of TVA's suppliers were to fail to perform under the terms of its contract with TVA, TVA might have to purchase replacement fuel, power, or other critical supplies, perhaps at a significantly higher price than TVA is entitled to pay under the contract. TVA may not be able to recover this difference from the original supplier. In addition, any disruption of TVA's supplies could require TVA to operate higher cost generation assets, thereby negatively affecting TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, if TVA were unable to acquire enough replacement fuel, power, or supplies, or were to have insufficient reserves to offset the loss, TVA may not be able to operate certain assets in the manner TVA determines is in its best interests or provide enough power to meet demand or provide power on a basis TVA considers most reliable. As a result, power curtailments, brownouts, or even blackouts could occur. 
 
 Global conflicts, terrorist activities, or military actions could adversely affect TVA s business. 
 
 Global conflicts and terrorism, as well as any retaliatory military action by the United States and its allies, may have an adverse effect on TVA through increased political, economic, and financial market instability and volatility in the prices for natural gas and oil. Future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in fuel and energy transportation and distribution, which may adversely affect TVA s ability to do business. TVA may experience increased costs to implement increased security, including additional plant security and security personnel. This situation could extend not only to fuel and minor components but could materially increase costs or decrease availability of large components needed for TVA s capital projects. 
 
 CYBERSECURITY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISKS 
 
 TVA s facilities and information infrastructure may not operate as planned due to cyber threats to TVA s assets and operations. 
 
 TVA s operations are heavily computerized and include assets such as information technology and networking systems. As with all industries, the reliance on computerization and networking makes TVA a target for cyber attacks, and the risk of such attacks may increase as individual devices and equipment become accessible via the internet. TVA has been targeted by cyber attacks in the past and anticipates that it will be targeted in the future. These attacks may have been carried out, or in the future could be carried out, by individuals, groups, or nation states. TVA employs extensive cyber safeguards and works with industry specialists and relevant governmental authorities to deter, stop, or mitigate cyber attacks. Despite implementation of these security measures, TVA's facilities and information infrastructure may be subject to or vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access. Furthermore, as technology becomes more prevalent in energy infrastructure, TVA's infrastructure may be subject to increased cyber vulnerability in the future. Cyber attacks could come through one or more of a number of means, such as computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, or ransomware. Cyber attacks may result in security breaches that may be detrimental to TVA's operations, including third parties' improperly accessing TVA's system and demanding ransom based on threats to expose sensitive data, including data from employees, customers, and financial parties, to gain operational control, or to expose security vulnerabilities specific to TVA s facilities. In such a case, a cyber attack could compromise sensitive data, significantly disrupt operations, require additional expenditures for 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 cybersecurity, negatively affect TVA s cash flows, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation, and pose health and safety risks to TVA personnel and the customers and communities that TVA serves. 
 
 Because the investigation of any cybersecurity breach is inherently unpredictable and would require substantial time to complete, TVA may not be able to quickly remediate the consequences of any breach, which may increase the costs and enhance the negative consequences associated with a breach. Additionally, the theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive data may subject TVA to penalties and claims from third parties or increased governmental oversight. 
 
 Cyber attacks on third parties or the failure of their technology infrastructure could interfere with or harm TVA. 
 
 Many third parties on which TVA relies for services, including for transferring funds to non-TVA entities or receiving delivery of products in the ordinary course of business, are heavily computerized and use assets such as information technology and networking systems. These providers' systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches and outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical attack, and similar events. If any of these third parties were to experience interference from cyber attacks or significant system failures or outages, which events have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future, the services they provide TVA could be disrupted. This disruption could interfere with TVA s ability to perform its obligations to others, transfer funds, obtain fuel or critical parts, supplies, or services, or make payments, which in turn could negatively affect TVA s cash flows, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. Additionally, the theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive data held by these third parties may subject TVA to further harm. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges Safeguarding Assets Cybersecurity for a discussion of recent cyber attacks on third parties. 
 
 The failure of TVA s information technology systems could have adverse consequences to TVA. 
 
 TVA s operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including the information technology systems that support TVA s underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of TVA s operations. TVA relies on information technology systems, including the internet and cloud systems, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data. Some of TVA s information technology systems may be dependent upon cloud service providers. These providers systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches and outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, security violations, and similar events. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or outages could materially affect the results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows of TVA. 
 
 The emergence of artificial intelligence technology could create challenges for TVA, and TVA may not be able to adopt the use of technology in step with private utilities. 
 
 TVA s sensitive information may be subject to improper disclosure or fabrication by artificial intelligence AI and machine learning technologies on systems external to TVA, leading to compromises in cybersecurity. AI and machine learning technology may also be flawed, and data sets used in generative AI may be insufficient or contain biased, incorrect, or incomplete information. Additionally, inconsistent application of AI regulations and guidance in the industry may make the intellectual property ownership and license rights to certain information unclear. TVA could suffer reputational damage or face operational challenges because of any inconsistencies or flaws in the application of AI or machine learning technology. TVA could also face costs in complying with any new regulations concerning AI. The cost of implementing new AI regulations or the consequences of not complying with any future regulations could harm TVA s financial condition. Moreover, AI may be used to enhance malicious cyber attacks. 
 
 FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET RISKS 
 
 Demand for electricity could be higher or lower in the future than TVA currently expects or is financially planning for. 
 
 TVA s current asset strategy and capital financing approach are based on assumptions drawn from recent trends suggesting increased demand for TVA electricity over the next several decades. This demand has arisen from, and seems likely to continue to arise from, among other things, increasing population in TVA s service territory, utilization of AI that uses significantly more power than traditional data processing, cryptocurrency mining, greater usage and adoption of electric vehicles, and economic development, including new or expanded data centers. Some factors that could unexpectedly lead to lower demand than TVA has planned for include one or more of the following: extended or severe economic downturns or recessions, loss of customer demand due to higher-than-expected adoption of TVA flexibility options that allow customers to produce a certain percent of their own power needs, unexpectedly high utilization of DER, increased energy efficiency and conservation, and loss of customers, including through loss of TVA s restricted service territory. Because TVA is investing heavily in developing its energy portfolio to meet increasing loads, lower-than-anticipated demand could lead to a reduction in planned revenue streams, which may constrain TVA s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 If future demand were to be higher than TVA can address through execution of its current asset strategy, TVA may have to purchase additional generation or capacity at rates much higher than TVA can produce electricity itself. The higher that demand is at such time nationally, the more expensive such additional generation or capacity is likely to be. In addition, if capacity were not available elsewhere, TVA may have to take emergency measures to curtail load, including requiring rolling blackouts. On the programmatic side, TVA may be forced to raise rates or waitlist prospective industrial or commercial customers. These outcomes would likely have a material adverse effect on TVA s financial condition and results of operations, including through negative impacts to TVA s reputation. 
 
 TVA could have to make significant future contributions to fund its qualified pension plan, and the increasing costs of the plan and employee benefits could adversely affect TVA's results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, TVA's qualified pension plan had assets of approximately 8.7 billion compared to liabilities of approximately 11.0 billion. The plan is mature with approximately 21,000 retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits of approximately 750 million per year. The costs of providing benefits depend upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, provisions of the plan; changing experience and assumptions related to terminations, retirements, and mortality; rates of increase in compensation levels; rates of return on plan assets; discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations and required funding levels; optional forms of benefit payments selected; future government regulation; and levels of contributions made to the plan. 
 
 The pension plan covers substantially all of TVA's full-time annual employees hired prior to July 1, 2014. Although the plan has been frozen to new participants since July 1, 2014, TVA's payment obligation under the pension plan is substantial, and changes in any one or more of these factors could cause TVA's benefit expenditures under the plan to increase and significantly exceed TVA's planned contributions. Unfavorable financial market conditions, including those arising from inflation and changes in interest rates, may cause lower-than-expected rates of return on plan assets, loss in value of the investments, and lower discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations. These changes would negatively impact the funded status of the plan and may require TVA to make contributions in excess of the amounts planned. In addition to the costs of the plan, the costs of providing health care benefits to TVA's employees and retirees have increased in recent years. Additional contributions to the plan and absorption of additional costs for the pension plan, health care plans, and other employee benefits would negatively affect TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 TVA s reliance on debt markets may make TVA more vulnerable to being unable to meet cash requirements than private utilities that can issue equity securities. 
 
 TVA uses cash provided by operations together with proceeds from power system financings to fund its current cash requirements. TVA's power system financings consist primarily of the sale of Bonds and secondarily of alternative forms of financing, such as lease arrangements. It is critical that TVA continue to have access to the debt markets to meet its cash requirements. The importance of having access to the debt markets is enhanced by the fact that TVA, unlike most utilities, relies almost entirely on debt capital, since as a governmental instrumentality, TVA cannot issue equity securities. TVA s access to the debt markets could be negatively impacted by market disruptions, including disruptions that result from systemic risks to the banking system and the financial markets. Moreover, rapid increases in interest rates beyond planning levels, especially as financing needs are increasing, or disruptions in the market due to rapid changes in interest rates, could impact TVA's cost of funds or ability to raise funds to meet cash needs. 
 
 TVA's debt ceiling may limit TVA's ability to carry out its business in the event that TVA were to approach or reach it. 
 
 Approaching or reaching the debt ceiling may negatively affect TVA's business by limiting TVA's ability to access capital markets and by increasing the amount of debt TVA must service without new debt capital. This occurrence may restrict TVA's ability to raise debt capital to acquire new power program assets or maintain existing ones, to carry out upgrades or improvements to existing assets or build new ones, to purchase power under long-term PPAs, or to meet regulatory requirements. A single generating facility could cost hundreds of millions of dollars or even billions depending on the fuel type, and TVA's ability to use new debt to fund strategic capital investments will decrease as TVA's debt increases and as the cost of projects increases. In addition, approaching or reaching the debt ceiling may lead to increased legislative or regulatory oversight of TVA's activities and could lead to negative rating actions by credit rating agencies. Operating at higher balances of Bonds subject to the 30.0 billion debt limit reduces TVA's financial flexibility for using financing to handle emergencies or other rapid cash funding needs and increases operational risks in management of the portfolio of Bonds subject to the debt limit. 
 
 TVA, together with owners of TVA securities, may be impacted by downgrades of TVA's credit ratings. 
 
 TVA s current credit ratings are not based solely on its underlying business or financial condition but are based to a large extent on TVA's status as a wholly-owned government corporation and the legislation that defines TVA s business structure. Key characteristics of TVA s business defined by legislation include (1) the TVA Board's ratemaking authority; (2) the current competitive environment, which is defined by the fence and the anti-cherrypicking provision; and (3) TVA s status as a corporate agency and instrumentality of the United States. If Congress takes any action that 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 effectively alters any of these characteristics, TVA's credit ratings could be downgraded. Although TVA Bonds are not obligations of the United States, TVA, as a corporate agency and instrumentality of the United States, may be impacted by a downgrade of the United States sovereign credit ratings. Such a downgrade has and could again in the future, among other things, lead to a downgrade of TVA s credit rating. Additionally, future events that may negatively impact TVA s financial condition or reputation, including those discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors, may lead to downgrades of TVA s credit ratings, and the criteria used by the credit rating agencies to assign ratings could be changed at any time, which could result in changes to TVA s ratings. 
 
 Downgrades of TVA s credit ratings, particularly downgrades related to TVA-specific factors, may have material adverse effects on TVA s cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on investors in TVA securities. Among other things, a downgrade could increase TVA s interest expense by increasing the interest rates that TVA pays on new debt securities that it issues. Such an increase may reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes, which may require TVA to borrow more, to reduce other expenses or capital investments, or to increase power rates. A downgrade may also result in TVA s having to post collateral under certain physical and financial contracts that contain ratings triggers. A downgrade below a contractual threshold may specifically prevent TVA from borrowing under four credit facilities totaling 2.7 billion or posting letters of credit as collateral under these facilities. As of September 30, 2024, there were 566 million of letters of credit outstanding under these facilities. If TVA were no longer able to post letters of credit as collateral, TVA would likely have to post cash as collateral, which would negatively affect TVA s liquidity. 
 
 Further, a downgrade may lower the price of TVA securities in the secondary market, thereby negatively impacting investors who sell TVA securities after the downgrade and diminishing the attractiveness and marketability of TVA securities in the secondary market as well as new TVA debt securities. 
 
 Changes in technology could affect relationships with customers, require TVA to change how it conducts its operations, or impact TVA's financial condition. 
 
 TVA's primary business is to sell power it produces, for the most part, from large facilities such as nuclear power plants, hydroelectric facilities, natural gas-fired facilities, and coal-fired units. TVA sells power to LPCs and directly served customers. Research and development activities are ongoing to improve existing and alternative technologies to produce or store electricity, including large-scale energy storage, gas or wind turbines, fuel cells, microturbines, solar cells, and distributed energy or storage resources. Advances in these or other alternative technologies could reduce the costs of such production methods to a level that will enable these technologies to compete effectively with traditional power plants such as those used by TVA. These technologies could be more appealing to customers and could lead them to pressure TVA to modify power contracts to allow customers to generate some of their own power requirements or purchase power from other suppliers. Other customers might also cease purchasing power from TVA altogether. To the extent that sales to such customers are reduced or eliminated, TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected. TVA could also be required to modify how it operates its traditional plants or further modify its generation mix to reduce reliance on these facilities. Additionally, demand could change in terms of amount or timing as more devices and equipment become connected to the internet, allowing for real-time adjustments in consumption of power. Such increased control over power consumption could, among other things, affect how TVA operates its facilities or dispatches power, or require TVA to change its pricing structure or rates. 
 
 TVA could lose its competitive edge if it fails to keep up with changes in technology. 
 
 TVA s competitive position could be impacted if TVA is unable to deploy new technology in a cost-effective and competitive manner. This process of enhancing or replacing TVA s technology infrastructure involves significant development and implementation costs to keep pace with changing technologies and customer demand. If TVA fails to successfully implement critical technology infrastructure, or if it does not provide the anticipated benefits or meet customer demands, such failure could negatively affect TVA s business strategy as well as impact its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Additionally, TVA may fail to fully capitalize on new technology, including AI, due to cybersecurity risk aversion or unique regulations applicable to TVA, leading to a loss in competitive edge or inability to efficiently solve future problems. 
 
 TVA is subject to a variety of market risks that may negatively affect TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 TVA is subject to a variety of market risks, including but not limited to the following: 
 
 Commodity Price Risk . TVA's rates may increase if prices of commodities critical to operations, including coal, uranium, natural gas, fuel oil, crude oil, construction materials, or emission allowances, were to increase. An increase in rates may reduce demand and negatively impact TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 Investment Price Risk . TVA is exposed to investment price risk in its NDT, Asset Retirement Trust ("ART"), pension plan, Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"), Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP"), and Restoration Plan ("RP"). If the value of the investments held in the NDT or the pension fund were to either decrease or fail to increase in accordance with assumed rates of return, TVA may be required to make substantial contributions to these funds. In addition, although TVA is not required to make contributions to the ART, it may choose to do so, particularly if TVA's estimates of its non-nuclear asset retirement obligation liabilities were to increase. TVA may also choose to make contributions to the SERP, DCP, and RP from time to time. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk . Changes in interest rates may, variably, increase the amount of interest that TVA pays on new Bonds that it issues, decrease the return that TVA receives on short-term investments, decrease the value of the investments in the NDT, ART, pension fund, SERP, DCP, and RP, increase the amount of collateral that TVA is required to post in connection with certain of its derivative transactions, increase the losses on the mark-to-market valuation of certain derivative transactions into which TVA has entered, or some combination of these. 
 
 Counterparty Credit and Performance Risk . TVA is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will not be able to perform their contractual obligations. If TVA's counterparties were to fail to perform their obligations, TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, the failure of a counterparty to perform may make it difficult for TVA to perform its obligations, particularly if the counterparty were a supplier of electricity or fuel. 
 
 Currency Exchange Rate Risk . Over the next several years, TVA expects to spend a significant amount of capital on various projects. A portion of this amount may be spent on contracts that are denominated in one or more foreign currencies. TVA's two issues of Bonds denominated in British pounds sterling are hedged by currency swap agreements. The value of the U.S. dollar compared with other currencies has fluctuated widely in recent years, including as a result of changes in political and economic conditions. If not effectively managed, foreign currency exposure could negatively impact TVA's counterparty risk, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 The market for TVA Bonds might be limited. 
 
 Although many TVA Bonds are listed on stock exchanges, there can be no assurances that any market will develop or continue to exist for any Bonds. Additionally, no assurances can be made as to the ability of the holders to sell their Bonds or as to the price at which holders will be able to sell their Bonds. Future trading prices of Bonds will depend on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, the then-current ratings assigned to the Bonds, the amount of Bonds outstanding, the time remaining until the maturity of the Bonds, the redemption features of the Bonds, the market for similar securities, and the level, direction, and volatility of interest rates generally, as well as the liquidity of the markets for those securities. 
 
 When a particular series of Bonds is offered through underwriters, those underwriters may attempt to make a market in the Bonds. Dealers other than underwriters may also make a market in TVA Bonds. However, the underwriters and dealers are not obligated to make a market in any TVA Bonds and may terminate any market-making activities at any time without notice. 
 
 Further, certain investors and underwriters use the environmental impact or sustainability of a company or industry as a criterion for deciding whether to invest in that company or industry. TVA's use of fossil fuels, among other things, could lead such investors or underwriters to not purchase TVA Bonds or reduce the attractiveness of TVA Bonds as compared to other investments, thereby limiting the market for TVA Bonds. Moreover, some investors may no longer be able to hold TVA securities after specified dates if TVA's performance on certain metrics fails to meet investor requirements on metrics such as the carbon intensity, carbon emissions, or operation of thermal coal-fired or natural gas-fired assets. 
 
 In addition, legal limitations may affect the ability of banks and others to invest in Bonds. For example, national banks may purchase TVA Bonds for their own accounts in an amount not to exceed 10 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus. Also, TVA Bonds are "obligations of a corporation which is an instrumentality of the United States" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(19)(C)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code for purposes of the 60 percent of assets limitation applicable to U.S. building and loan associations. These limitations on TVA Bond investors also may limit the market for TVA Bonds. 
 
 Payment of principal and interest on TVA securities is not guaranteed by the U.S government. 
 
 Although TVA Bonds are not obligations of the United States, TVA, as a corporate agency and instrumentality of the United States, may be impacted by a downgrade of the United States' sovereign credit ratings. Principal and interest on TVA securities are payable solely from TVA's net power proceeds. Net power proceeds are the remainder of TVA's gross power revenues after deducting the costs of operating, maintaining, and administering its power properties and payments to states and counties in lieu of taxes, but before deducting depreciation accruals or other charges representing the amortization of capital expenditures, plus the net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 power facility or interest therein. If TVA were to experience extreme financial difficulty and were unable to make payments of principal or interest on its Bonds, the federal government would not be legally obligated to prevent TVA from defaulting on its obligations. An inability to pay some or all of the principal or interest owed on a TVA security would likely have a negative impact on the market for TVA Bonds generally and TVA's financial condition, reputation, and relationship with the investment community, and could result in cross-defaults in other financial arrangements. 
 
 HUMAN CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT RISKS 
 
 Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified, diverse, and inclusive workforce may negatively affect TVA's results of operations. 
 
 TVA's business depends on its ability to recruit and retain key executive officers as well as skilled professional and technical employees. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond TVA's control, including the highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, inflation, regional health emergencies, and workforce participation rates. The inability to attract and retain an appropriately qualified, diverse, and inclusive workforce could adversely affect TVA's ability to, among other things, operate and maintain generation and transmission facilities, complete large construction projects, and successfully implement its continuous improvement initiatives. 
 
 Changes in the membership of the TVA Board and TVA senior management could impact how TVA operates. 
 
 The TVA Board is comprised of up to nine part-time members serving staggered, five-year terms. One to two Board members' terms typically expire each year. In addition, there is always the possibility that one or more members of TVA's senior management may retire or otherwise leave TVA. The individuals filling either the TVA Board or senior management positions may wish to change how TVA operates in whole or in part. If the changes were not successful or TVA were unable to adapt properly to such changes, TVA's financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and relationship with customers could be negatively affected. 
 
 Loss of a quorum of the TVA Board could limit TVA's ability to adapt to changing business conditions. 
 
 Under the TVA Act, a quorum of the TVA Board is five members. Becoming a member of the TVA Board requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate following appointment by the President. This process has been and could again in the future be subject to extended delays. The President may remove TVA Board members, and the TVA Board members may resign or otherwise leave office before a successor is commissioned. As a result, a delay in the appointment or confirmation of directors, or the removal of directors by the President, can threaten the TVA Board's quorum. The TVA Board is responsible for, among other things, establishing the rates TVA charges for power as well as TVA's long-term objectives, policies, and plans. Accordingly, the loss of a quorum for an extended period of time would impair TVA's ability to change rates and to modify these objectives, policies, and plans. Such an impairment would likely have a negative impact on TVA's ability to respond to significant changes in technology, the regulatory environment, or the industry overall and, in turn, negatively affect TVA's cash flows, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. The TVA Board currently has eight members. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND CATASTROPHIC EVENTS 
 
 Weather conditions may hamper TVA's ability to supply power or negatively impact net revenue, and weather conditions may cause customers' demand for power to exceed TVA's then-present power supply capabilities. 
 
 Weather may have a material adverse effect on TVA s cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition, including through the following non-exclusive foreseeable scenarios: 
 
 Extreme temperatures may increase the demand for power and require TVA to purchase power at high prices to meet customer demand, whereas unusually mild weather may result in decreased demand for power and lead to reduced electricity sales. 
 Periods of either high or low levels of rainfall may impede river traffic, impacting barge deliveries of critical items such as coal and equipment for power facilities. 
 High river water temperatures in the summer may limit TVA's ability to use water from the Tennessee or Cumberland River systems for cooling at certain of TVA's generating facilities, thereby limiting its ability to operate these generating facilities. This situation would be aggravated during periods of reduced rainfall or drought. 
 Changes in the climate may make, or may be making, such shifts in weather more common or extreme. Climate change may cause catastrophic events like droughts, floods, wildfires, heat waves, and snow or ice storms to occur more frequently in the Tennessee Valley region. In response, TVA may be required to, among other things, change its generation mix or change how it conducts its operations. 
 Extreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms or other catastrophic events could stress TVA's transmission and distribution systems, communication systems, and technology, including information technology, resulting in increased restoration, maintenance, and capital costs and reduced reliability, and may 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 even result in events such as the failure of a dam or an incident at a coal-fired, gas-fired, or nuclear plant or a CCR facility. 
 
 Events that affect the supply or quality of water from the Tennessee River system and Cumberland River system, or elsewhere, may interfere with TVA's ability to generate power. 
 
 An inadequate supply of water in the Tennessee River system and Cumberland River system could negatively impact TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition, including potentially reducing generation at TVA's hydroelectric plants, which may require TVA to increase reliance on more expensive generation sources or purchase more energy in the market likely at higher costs; negatively affecting generation at coal-fired and nuclear plants, which depend on water from the river systems near which they are located for cooling and for use in boilers where water is converted into steam to drive turbines; or negatively affecting generation at TVA's gas-fired facilities not located near a river, which nonetheless require alternative sources of water, such as from wells or local utility companies. 
 
 Further, the water for these purposes must be of a particular quality for use in TVA's equipment. When the available water is not of sufficient quality for TVA's use, TVA must either treat the water or obtain alternate sources. An inadequate supply of quality water could result, among other things, from periods of low rainfall or drought, the withdrawal of water from the river systems by governmental entities or others, incidents affecting bodies of water not managed by TVA, supply issues that affect water providers, or intrusive aquatic plants and animals such as eel grass, algae, and mussels that block cooling water intake pipes or otherwise interfere with the operation of TVA's generation facilities. While TVA manages the Tennessee River and a large portion of its tributary system to provide much of the water necessary for the operation of its power plants, the USACE operates and manages other bodies of water upon which some of TVA's facilities rely. Events at these bodies of water or their associated hydroelectric facilities may interfere with the flow of water and may result in TVA's having insufficient water quality to meet the needs of some of its generating plants. If TVA were to have insufficient water supply of the quality necessary to meet the needs of its plants, TVA may be required to reduce generation at its affected facilities to levels compatible with the available supply of quality water, or take additional steps that change how TVA conducts its operations or that otherwise cause TVA to incur additional expense. 
 
 Catastrophic events are an ever present risk of financial loss and disruption to TVA's business. 
 
 TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected, either directly or indirectly, by catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, solar events, electromagnetic pulses, geomagnetic disturbances, droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, polar vortexes, icing events, pipeline explosions, or other casualty events, wars, national emergencies, terrorist activities, pandemics or epidemics, widespread public health crises, geopolitical conflicts, or other similar destructive or disruptive events. These events, the frequency and severity of which are unpredictable, may, among other things, cause health, safety, or environmental problems; limit or disrupt TVA's ability to generate and transmit power; lead to legislative or regulatory changes that affect the construction, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear units and the storage of spent fuel; limit or disrupt TVA's ability to provide flood control and river management; reduce the demand for power; disrupt fuel or other supplies; require TVA to produce additional tritium; cause or exacerbate an economic downturn; require TVA to make substantial capital investments for repairs, improvements, or modifications; negatively affect the cost or availability of insurance; or cause or exacerbate instability in the financial markets. Additionally, some studies have predicted that climate change may cause catastrophic events, such as heat waves, droughts, and floods, to occur more frequently or with greater intensity in the Tennessee Valley region, which could adversely impact TVA. 
 
 These destructive or disruptive events may present special risks to TVA s nuclear plants. If public opposition to nuclear power were to make operating nuclear plants less feasible because of any of these events, TVA may be forced to shut down its nuclear plants. This would make it substantially more difficult for TVA to obtain greater amounts of its power supply from low or zero carbon emitting resources and to replace its generation capacity when faced with retiring or idling certain coal-fired units. 
 
 ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS 
 
 TVA's financial control system cannot guarantee that all control issues and instances of fraud or errors will be prevented or detected. 
 
 No financial control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met, and no evaluation of financial controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or errors can or will be prevented or detected. The design of any system of financial controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.

TVA may be unable to use regulatory accounting for some or all costs. 
 
 TVA uses regulatory accounting to defer certain costs. To qualify for regulatory accounting, costs must meet certain accounting criteria and be approved for regulatory accounting treatment by the TVA Board in its capacity as TVA's regulator. When costs do not meet, or cease to meet, these criteria, or if the TVA Board were to disallow the treatment or were to cease to be TVA's sole regulator in such areas, TVA may not be able to defer those costs. Such an inability to defer costs would likely have a substantial impact on TVA's financial condition and results of operations and could impact the timing and amounts of TVA's rate recovery. For a discussion of regulatory accounting, see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates . 
 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 
 TVA may not be able to implement its business strategy successfully. 
 
 TVA's financial condition and results of operations are largely dependent on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully. TVA's strategy includes maintaining low rates, aligning operations and maintenance costs with revenues, being responsible stewards, living within its means, meeting reliability expectations, and providing a balanced portfolio, in light of TVA's strategic priorities. The strategic priorities are Powerful Partnerships, People Advantage, Operational Excellence, Igniting Innovation, and Financial Strength. This strategy is subject to business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond TVA s control. Such uncertainties include customer energy-efficiency programs that are designed to reduce energy demand; energy-efficiency efforts by customers not related to TVA s energy-efficiency programs; increased customer use of DER, such as solar panels and other technologies, as well as the use of energy storage technologies; and macroeconomic factors impacting economic growth or contraction within TVA s service territory, which could affect energy demand. If TVA is unable to successfully implement its business strategy, TVA s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected. See Item 1, Business Environmental Matters and Human Capital Management , Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Initiatives and Challenges , and Part III, Item 11, Executive Compensation C ompensation Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding TVA's strategic objectives. 
 
 TVA's cost reduction efforts may not be successful. 
 
 TVA is undertaking a cost optimization project to partially offset cost increases expected for the years 2024 through 2026, and achieving this goal may prove challenging, particularly if inflation rates remain high. The failure to achieve or maintain cost reduction targets could adversely affect TVA's rates, reputation, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, if TVA fails to limit rate increases as provided in the long-term Partnership Agreements, participating LPCs have a right to renegotiate or terminate the Partnership Agreements. 
 
 TVA's organizational structure may not adequately support TVA's anticipated business needs or enable it to meet the needs of its current or potential customers. 
 
 TVA has been modifying its organizational structure to better adapt to the forecasted economic environment. If TVA's assumptions about either its forecasts or the proper internal structure of the company to meet the expected environment are inaccurate or if this structure does not adequately support TVA's needs, TVA could face operational or financial challenges that could adversely affect its cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition as well as TVA's ability to attract or retain a skilled workforce and to meet the needs of its current or potential customers. 
 
 TVA may have difficulty adapting its business model to changes in the utility industry and customer preferences. 
 
 The traditional business model for power production, selling power from centrally located plants, is facing pressure from a variety of sources, including the potential for self-generation by current or potential customers, new technologies such as energy storage, and increased energy efficiency. These pressures may reduce the demand for TVA power. If TVA does not or cannot adapt to this pressure by adequately changing its business model, TVA's financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected. 
 
 TVA's reputation may be negatively impacted. 
 
 As with any company, TVA's reputation is a vital element of its ability to effectively conduct its business. TVA's reputation could be harmed by a variety of factors, including failure of a generating asset or supporting infrastructure; failure to effectively manage land and other natural resources entrusted to TVA; real or perceived violations of environmental regulations, including those related to climate change; real or perceived issues with TVA's safety culture or work environment; inability to meet its human capital management goals; inability to meet its carbon reduction

Table of Contents 

 aspirations; inability to keep its electricity rates stable; involvement in a class-action or other high-profile lawsuit; significant delays in construction projects; occurrence of or responses to cyber attacks or security vulnerabilities; acts or omissions of TVA management or acts or omissions of a contractor or other third-party working with or for TVA, which actually or perceivably reflect negatively on TVA; measures taken to offset reductions in demand or to supply rising demand; or a significant dispute with one of TVA's customers. 
 
 Any deterioration in TVA's reputation may harm TVA's relationships with its customers and stakeholders, may increase its cost of doing business, may interfere with its ability to attract and retain a qualified, inclusive, and diverse workforce, may impact TVA's ability to raise debt capital, and may potentially lead to the enactment of new laws and regulations, or the modification of existing laws and regulations, that negatively affect the way TVA conducts its business.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 
 Risk Management 
 
 TVA s cybersecurity risk management programs and processes exist under a written cybersecurity policy, which provides the foundation for TVA s information security programs. Under the policy, TVA engages assessors, consultants, auditors, and other third parties. All TVA employees, contractors, grantees, other federal agencies, state and local governments, industry partners, and others who possess TVA information or who operate, use, or have access to TVA's information systems are made responsible for complying with TVA's cybersecurity policy and information security-related communications, plans, practices, procedures, and standards issued as part of the information security programs. 
 
 TVA s cybersecurity risk management framework provides the structure for protecting against cybersecurity threats, including through promoting risk management efforts, situational awareness, and cyber risk modeling and simulations. Within this framework, TVA operates numerous programs under internal written policies and procedures, which are aimed at helping protect TVA s information resources. These include a vulnerability management program to help address cybersecurity threats to TVA digital assets; a patch and remediation management program to help computer systems remain current with software patches or software updates; an offensive threat management program to emulate threat actor activities; a cybersecurity training program to help educate employees and contractors, including by providing scenarios designed to train the workforce on responding to cybersecurity incidents; implementation of standard terms and conditions where appropriate in TVA s supply chain contracts to help mitigate TVA s cybersecurity risk, including through requiring timely notice of vendor cybersecurity incidents and data impacts and compliance with laws, regulations, and TVA s policies on cybersecurity; and a program to accomplish cybersecurity event detection alerting. These programs are based on principles from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and certain regulatory standards that are designed to protect against cybersecurity incidents, including the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards and Nuclear Regulatory Commission cybersecurity standards, and are periodically assessed by third-party experts. 
 
 In the last three fiscal years, TVA has not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents. TVA is not currently aware of any potential cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that may have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect TVA, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition; however, TVA cannot provide assurance that it will not be materially affected in the future by cybersecurity risks or any future material risks. For more information on TVA s cybersecurity related risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors Cybersecurity and Information Technology Risks in this Annual Report. 
 
 Governance 
 
 The TVA Board is ultimately responsible for oversight of the identification, management, and mitigation of enterprise-wide risk, including cybersecurity risk, and receives reports from the Audit, Risk, and Cybersecurity Committee Audit Committee ). The Audit Committee is a standing committee of the TVA Board and advises the TVA Board on a variety of matters, including TVA s processes for identifying, monitoring, and mitigating enterprise risk and reviewing and overseeing strategies for addressing TVA s cybersecurity, data, and privacy policies and response protocols. The Audit Committee meets at least quarterly. Reporting to the Audit Committee and the TVA Board is the risk counsel comprised of TVA s top leaders and the Chief Risk Officer CRO ), which is responsible for the highest level of management oversight of risk at TVA. The risk committee s primary purpose is to oversee TVA s management of enterprise-wide risks with policy implications reported to the TVA Board or a designated TVA Board committee. The risk committee oversees a subordinate committee that provides comprehensive risk oversight of TVA s security, artificial intelligence, privacy, and technology risks consistent with TVA s mission, strategic imperatives, and approved financial and operational plans. 
 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 TVA s governance, oversight, execution, and support activities include quarterly Enterprise Risk and Assurance updates to the Audit Committee, an annual alignment with TVA s broader risk management framework and business planning initiatives, and tactical and intentional initiatives focused on reducing risk, increasing maturity, and helping ensure regulatory compliance and adherence. TVA engages in various audits in order to provide assurance of TVA s effective management of cybersecurity risk and risk as a whole and is also subject to required external audits to ensure compliance with certain regulatory standards that are designed to protect against cybersecurity incidents. 
 
 TVA's current VP, Cybersecurity serves as Chief Information Security Officer ("CISO"). The current CISO is also designated as the Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer and the agency s Federal Senior Intelligence Coordinator. Starting in operational technology as part of nuclear generation, the current CISO has spent his career in public power in various North American Electric Reliability Corporation regions and has been in the industry for over 25 years. He has led Cybersecurity for over 10 years in the sector. He was previously the CISO of the New York Power Authority, and he has experience supporting all verticals of electric operations, from the perspectives of security, resiliency, and recovery. He is a Certified Information Security Manager and has previously held Chair and Co-chair roles in the industry, such as with the Electric Subsector Coordinating Council's Cyber Mutual Aid Committee. He seeks to focus on information sharing and building partnerships to enable understanding of emerging threats. The current CISO remains active in various security organizations and the broader industry. He has a degree in Computer Science and a Master of Business Administration. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 
 TVA holds personal property in its own name but generally holds real property as agent for the U.S. TVA may acquire real property as an agent of the U.S. by negotiated purchase or by eminent domain. 

Generating Properties 
 
 At September 30, 2024, TVA-operated generating assets consisted of seven nuclear units, 24 active coal-fired units, 70 simple-cycle gas units (68 active units and two idled units), one cogeneration unit, 14 combined-cycle gas power blocks, 109 conventional hydroelectric units (106 active units and three units in long-term outage and unavailable for service), four pumped-storage hydroelectric units, five diesel generator units, and nine operating solar installations. As of September 30, 2024, four of the combined-cycle power blocks were leased to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and leased back to TVA under long-term leases. See Note 11 Variable Interest Entities and Note 14 Debt and Other Obligations Lease/Leasebacks . In addition, TVA is leasing the three Caledonia combined-cycle power blocks under a long-term lease. For a discussion of these assets, see Item 1, Business Power Supply and Load Management Resources . 
 
 Net Capability 
 
 Net capability is defined as the ability of an electric system, generating unit, or other system component to carry or generate power for a specified time period. It does not include real-time bulk electrical system operating constraints such as transmission line loading limitations, fuel availability such as coal, gas, and seasonal river reservoir levels, fuel blend, severe weather events, environmental and/or other regulatory constraints, transmission system outages, generator outages, or generator derates. Summer net capability as presented in the table below reflects the expected output of individual resources at TVA s anticipated summer demand peak. The summation of those individual resources does not include the real-time bulk electrical system operating constraints previously noted. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors Operational Risks and Risks Related to the Environment and Catastrophic Events. 
 
 In addition to the TVA-operated generating facilities presented in the table below, TVA also has 8,304 MWs of operating capacity available through PPAs. At September 30, 2024, these contracts were comprised of 3,206 MWs of renewable PPAs and 5,098 MWs of nonrenewable PPAs. The summation of TVA's PPAs under contract does not include real-time operating constraints, such as intermittency of renewable resources associated with weather or other factors. See Item 1, Business Power Supply and Load Management Resources Power Purchase and Other Agreements for information on TVA's renewable and nonrenewable power purchase contracts by resource type and location.

Business and Mission 
 
 Business 
 
 TVA operates the nation's largest public power system. At September 30, 2024, TVA had 61 directly served customers, which include seven federal agency customers, and 153 local power company customers ("LPCs") that serve approximately 10 million people in parts of seven southeastern states. TVA generates nearly all of its revenues from the sale of electricity, and in 2024 revenues from the sale of electricity totaled 12.1 billion. As a wholly-owned agency and instrumentality of the United States ("U.S."), however, TVA differs from other electric utilities in a number of ways: 
 
 TVA is a government corporation. 
 
 The area in which TVA sells power is limited by the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, as amended, (the "TVA Act"), under a provision known as the "fence"; however, another provision of federal law known as the Anti-Cherrypicking Amendment ("ACPA") generally protects TVA from being forced to provide access to its transmission lines to others for the purpose of delivering power to customers within substantially all of TVA's defined service area. 
 
 The rates TVA charges for power are set solely by the TVA Board of Directors ("TVA Board") and are not set or reviewed by another entity, such as a public utility commission. In setting rates, however, the TVA Board is charged by the TVA Act to have due regard for the primary objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective that power be sold at rates as low as feasible. 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 TVA is not authorized to raise capital by issuing equity securities. TVA relies primarily on cash from operations and proceeds from power program borrowings to fund its operations and is authorized by the TVA Act to issue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness (collectively, "Bonds") in an amount not to exceed 30.0 billion outstanding at any given time. Although TVA's operations were originally funded primarily with appropriations from Congress, TVA has not received any appropriations from Congress for any activities since 1999 and, as directed by Congress, has funded essential stewardship activities primarily with power revenues. 
 
 TVA's Mission of Service 
 
 TVA was built for the people, created by federal legislation, and charged with a unique mission - to improve the quality of life in a seven-state region through the integrated management of the region's resources. TVA's mission focuses on three key areas: 

ENERGY ENVIRONMENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
 
 Energy Delivering reliable, low cost, clean energy; 
 
 Environment Caring for the region's natural resources; and 
 
 Economic Development Creating sustainable economic growth. 
 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 While TVA's mission has not changed since it was established in 1933, the climate in which TVA operates continues to evolve. The business and economic environment has become more challenging due to economic conditions; tougher environmental standards; and the need to diversify its power supply and adapt to changing customer usage behaviors, new technologies, and emerging, non-traditional competition. To continue to deliver its mission of service while evolving for future success, TVA must realize five strategic priorities, which are comprised of several strategic elements each: 
 
 Foster a culture that embraces, adapts quickly to, and anticipates changes needed for TVA to excel in the future public power utility marketplace Support inclusion with diversity efforts to attract and retain the best talent for TVA Deliver an efficient and agile HR service model that enables enterprise effectiveness Develop the next generation of TVA leaders Nation s top nuclear fleet by 2025 Achieve leading operational performance by managing the generation fleet based on the mission of each asset Gas and hydro to top quartile Coal fleet based on end of life Increase generation and transmission capacity while fostering excellence in project management and construction Advance TVA s grid capabilities to increase flexibility for future additions and to meet the reliability and resiliency needs of the future Accelerate the deployment of existing clean technologies including solar, storage, energy efficiency, and demand response Maintain financial health while funding TVA's energy transition Ensure sufficient revenues to meet financial commitments (revenue requirements) Evolve the public power model while incorporating Valley Vision 2035 Build partnerships and community connections to enable solutions Champion the public power model through the region s energy expansion Align with TVA's customers and economic development agencies to target industries that are critical to the Valley s long-term success Responsibly foster excellence in natural resource management and environmental stewardship as TVA transitions to the energy system of the future Advance energy transformation in the Valley through leveraging technology and innovation in all of TVA's work Refine innovation framework to align with TVA s strategic intent Support the development of new technologies to further accelerate decarbonization and prepare to deploy commercially viable technologies 
 
 TVA's mission sets the stage for its strategic planning process that includes strategic objectives, initiatives, and scorecards for performance designed to provide clear direction for improving TVA's core business. 
 
 Linking the Mission to Performance 
 
 TVA has formulated key performance measures to support its strategic priorities. The intent of these measures is to align employees to TVA's mission by focusing its collective efforts on operational excellence, fiscal responsibility, economic development, and environmental stewardship. The measures are designed to promote teamwork, encourage high performance behaviors, and motivate TVA employees to achieve goals aligned with TVA's mission and values. The 2024 corporate results compared with targets for these key measures are reflected in the chart below, and the subsequent chart reflects the 2025 approved corporate measures. See Part III, Item 11, Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis for information regarding how the 2024 measures are calculated.

 Executive Overview 
 
 TVA's operating revenues were 12.3 billion and 12.1 billion for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating revenues increased for the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher effective base rates and higher sales volume, partially offset by lower fuel rates. Effective base rates were higher primarily due to the TVA Board action to approve a 4.5 percent wholesale base rate increase beginning in 2024 and the pandemic credits ending on September 30, 2023. The higher sales volume was driven by a 20 percent increase in cooling degree days as compared to the same period of the prior year. Lower fuel rates were primarily due to lower coal, natural gas, and purchased power prices. 
 
 On January 17, 2024, TVA reached an all-time record high peak power demand of approximately 34,577 megawatts ("MW"). This peak was nearly 1,100 MW greater than TVA's previous all-time peak and over 1,100 MW greater than TVA's peak power demand during Winter Storm Elliott in December 2022. In addition, TVA reached a second highest peak power demand of approximately 34,284 MW on January 21, 2024. 
 
 Total operating expenses decreased 274 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in fuel and purchased power expense. Fuel and purchased power expense decreased 432 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to lower coal, natural gas, and purchased power prices. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 75 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation expense associated with the retirement of Bull Run Fossil Plant ("Bull Run"). These decreases were partially offset by a 269 million increase in Operating and maintenance expense primarily due to increases in payroll and benefit costs due to labor escalation for cost of living increases and additional headcount to support operational needs, outage expense driven by an increase in nuclear outage days, and contract labor costs primarily related to strategic project work and power operations performance improvement activities. 
 Commercial operations began on Paradise Combustion Turbine Units ("CTs") 5-7 on December 29, 2023. TVA also has ongoing natural gas projects at its Johnsonville, Cumberland, and Kingston sites and is evaluating natural gas projects for the replacement generation for the second unit at Cumberland, a new Caledonia CT plant on TVA land, and an aeroderivative CT project at TVA's Allen site. In addition, the first license renewal application was submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in January 2024 for the three units at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant following the completion of a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS"). TVA documented its final decision related to the retirement of Kingston with the Record of Decision on April 2, 2024. TVA plans to retire the nine coal-fired units at Kingston by the end of calendar year ("CY") 2027 and replace the retired generation with an energy complex that includes natural gas, battery storage, and solar. 
 On May 8, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") published its final legacy coal combustion residual ("CCR") rule ("Legacy CCR Rule"), which expands the scope of the existing regulatory requirements of EPA's 2015 CCR rule, as revised ("2015 CCR Rule"), to include two additional classes of CCR units: legacy CCR surface impoundments ("Legacy SIs") and CCR management units ("CCRMUs"). As a result of the enactment of the final rule, during 2024, TVA recorded additional estimated AROs of 3.1 billion and recorded a corresponding regulatory asset of 3.1 billion due to these AROs being associated with closed sites and asset retirement costs having been fully depreciated.

 Results of Operations 
 
 Sales of Electricity 
 
 Sales of electricity, which accounted for nearly all of TVA's operating revenues, were 162,933 million and 157,311 million kilowatt hours ("kWh") for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total sales of electricity in 2024 includes 137 million kWh of pre-commercial generation at Paradise CTs 5-7, all of which was recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2023. Total sales of electricity in 2023 includes 99 million kWh of pre-commercial generation at Colbert CT Units 9-11. TVA sells power at wholesale rates to LPCs that then resell the power to their customers at retail rates. TVA also sells power to directly served customers, consisting primarily of federal agencies and customers with large or nonstandard loads. In addition, power exceeding TVA's system needs is sold under exchange power arrangements with certain other power systems.

 Weather affects both the demand for TVA power and the price for that power. TVA uses degree days to measure the impact of weather on its power operations. Degree days measure the extent to which the TVA system 23-station average temperatures vary from 65 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 Degree Days Variation from Normal Change from Prior Period 2024 Normal Percent Variation 2023 Normal Percent Variation Percent Change Heating Degree Days 2,801 3,152 (11.1) 2,774 3,132 (11.4) 1.0 Cooling Degree Days 1,954 1,824 7.1 1,634 1,824 (10.4) 19.6 
 
 Sales of electricity increased approximately four percent for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of the prior year. The increased sales volume for LPCs was primarily driven by an increase in cooling degree days of 20 percent. For industries directly served, sales of electricity increased primarily within the data processing, hosting, and related services sector due to business-specific factors.

 TVA's two largest LPCs Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division ("MLGW") and Nashville Electric Service ("NES") have contracts with a five-year and a 20-year termination notice period, respectively. Sales to MLGW and NES accounted for nine percent and eight percent, respectively, of TVA's total operating revenues during both the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 TVA's rate structure uses pricing signals to indicate seasons and hours of higher cost to serve its customers and to capture a portion of TVA's fixed costs in fixed charges. The structure includes three base revenue components: time of use demand charges, time of use energy charges, and a grid access charge ("GAC"). The demand charges are based upon the customer's peak monthly usage. The energy charges are based on time differentiated kWh used by the customer. Both of these components can be significantly impacted by weather. The GAC captures a portion of fixed costs and is offset by a corresponding reduction to the energy rates. The GAC also reduces the impact of weather variability to the overall rate structure.

TVA has a Partnership Agreement option that better aligns the length of LPC power contracts with TVA's long-term commitments. Under the partnership arrangement, the LPC power contracts automatically renew each year and have a 20-year termination notice. The partnership arrangements can be terminated under certain circumstances, including TVA s failure to limit rate increases to no more than 10 percent during any consecutive five-fiscal-year period, as more specifically described in the agreements. Participating LPCs receive benefits including a 3.1 percent wholesale bill credit in exchange for their long-term commitment, which enables TVA to recover its long-term financial commitments over a commensurate period. As of September 30, 2024, 148 LPCs had signed the 20-year Partnership Agreement with TVA. 
 
 In addition to base revenues, the rate structure includes a separate fuel rate that includes the costs of natural gas, fuel oil, purchased power, coal, emission allowances, nuclear fuel, and other fuel-related commodities; realized gains and losses on derivatives purchased to hedge the costs of such commodities; and payments to states and counties in lieu of taxes ("tax equivalents") associated with the fuel cost adjustments. See Part I, Item 1, Business Rates Rate Methodology . 
 
 In August 2024, the TVA Board approved a 5.25 percent wholesale base rate increase (excluding fuel) effective October 1, 2024. This adjustment is estimated to produce an additional 495 million of revenue during 2025.

 Notes 
 (1) In 2022, the TVA Board approved a 2.5 percent monthly base rate credit, the Pandemic Recovery Credit, which was effective for 2023. The pandemic credits ended September 30, 2023. 
 (2) Includes economic development credits to promote growth in the Tennessee Valley, hydro preference credits for residential customers of LPCs, and demand response credits allowing TVA to reduce industrial customer usage in periods of peak demand to balance system demand. See Note 17 Revenue. 
 (3) Represents revenue capitalized during pre-commercial operations at Paradise CTs 5-7 in 2024 and Colbert CTs 9-11 in 2023. 
 
 Operating revenues increased 260 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 862 million increase in base revenue. The 862 million increase in base revenue was driven by a 637 million increase attributable to higher effective base rates and a 225 million increase attributable to higher sales volume. The increase in effective base rates was primarily due to the TVA Board action to approve a 4.5 percent wholesale base rate increase beginning in 2024 and the pandemic credits ending on September 30, 2023. The higher sales volume was primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days of 20 percent. Partially offsetting the increase in base revenue was a 627 million decrease in fuel cost recovery revenue. The 627 million decrease in fuel cost recovery revenue was driven by a 774 million decrease attributable to lower fuel rates partially offset by a 147 million increase attributable to higher sales volume. The lower fuel rates were primarily due to lower coal, natural gas, and purchased power prices.

 (2) Fuel expense related to oil consumed for startup at coal-fired facilities was 23 million and 33 million for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 (3) Fuel expense related to oil consumed for generation at natural gas and/or oil-fired facilities was 8 million and 14 million for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 (4) Total cost per kWh is based on a weighted average. 
 
 Fuel expense decreased 380 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in effective fuel rates due to lower coal and natural gas prices, resulting in a 373 million decrease in fuel expense. Additionally, fuel expense decreased 46 million due to the deferral of unplanned coal costs during the summer of 2024 and the recovery of unplanned fuel costs in the prior year that were deferred in the summer of 2022. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of 39 million in fuel expense due to higher demand for energy. 
 
 Purchased power expense decreased 52 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower purchased power market prices compared to the same period of the prior year, resulting in a decrease of 259 million. Additionally, purchased power expense decreased 43 million due to the deferral of unplanned purchased power costs from less availability of nuclear and hydro generation and the recovery of unplanned 
 68 

Table of Contents 

 purchased power costs in the prior year that were deferred in the summer of 2022. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of 250 million in purchased power expense due to higher demand for energy, and to a lesser extent, less availability of nuclear and hydro generation. 
 
 Operating and maintenance expense increased 269 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to 126 million of increased payroll and benefit costs primarily due to labor escalation for cost of living increases and additional headcount to support operational needs, a 39 million increase in outage expense primarily due to an increase in nuclear outage days, and 30 million of increased contract labor costs primarily related to strategic project work and power operations performance improvement activities. In addition, there was a 12 million increase in materials and supplies related to power operations performance improvement activities and other natural gas project work and a 9 million increase in expenditures related to TVA's New Nuclear Program. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 75 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation expense of 206 million related to the decision to retire Bull Run, as Bull Run became fully depreciated in the fourth quarter of 2023. Partially offsetting this decrease was a 44 million increase in depreciation primarily related to TVA's decision to retire Cumberland and Kingston, a 38 million increase in amortization expense from amortization of finance leases and retirement of regulatory assets, and a 19 million increase due to Colbert CTs 9-11 and Paradise CTs 5-7 being placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, respectively. The remainder of the partially offsetting increase was primarily due to depreciation of other additions to net completed plant. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Property, Plant, and Equipment, and Depreciation Depreciation . 
 
 Tax equivalents expense decreased 36 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in the tax equivalents collected in the fuel cost recovery. 
 
 Generating Sources. The following tables show TVA's generation and purchased power by generating source as a percentage of all electrical power generated and purchased (based on kWh) for the periods indicated:

 Notes 
 (1) The generation for 2023 includes 99 million kWh of pre-commercial generation at Colbert CTs 9-11. The generation for 2024 includes 137 million kWh of pre-commercial generation at Paradise CTs 5-7. 
 (2) Generation from TVA-owned renewable resources (non-hydroelectric) is less than one percent for all periods shown and therefore is not represented in the table above. 
 (3) Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant net generation is allocated against each TVA-operated generation facility and purchased power type for both the year ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended September 30, 2023. See Part I, Item 1, Business Power Supply and Load Management Resources Hydroelectric Pumped-Storage for a discussion of Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant. 
 (4) Purchased power (natural gas and/or oil-fired) includes generation from Caledonia CC, which is currently a leased facility operated by TVA. Generation from Caledonia Combined Cycle Plant (" Caledonia CC") was 4,798 million kWh and 4,030 million kWh for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 (5) Purchased power (other renewables) includes purchased power from the following renewable sources: solar, wind, biomass, and renewable cogeneration. TVA acquires Renewable Energy Certificates ("RECs") in connection with certain purchased power transactions and sells some of these RECs to customers. 
 
 In addition to power supply sources included here, TVA offers energy efficiency programs that effectively reduce energy 
 needs. In 2024, TVA invested 71 million on its energy efficiency programs and effectively reduced 2024 energy needs by approximately 205 gigawatt hours of net incremental energy efficiency savings.

 (2) Includes average balances of long-term power bonds, debt of VIEs, and discount notes. 
 (3) Includes interest on long-term power bonds, debt of VIEs, and discount notes. 
 
 Total interest expense increased 10 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This was primarily driven by a 23 million increase from higher average balances on long-term debt and an 8 million increase from higher average rates on short-term debt, partially offset by a 13 million decrease from lower average rates on long-term debt, a 5 million decrease from lower average balances on short-term debt, and a 3 million decrease due to lower interest expense related to finance leases. 
 
 Other Income, Net 
 
 Other income, net increased 10 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by market gains on TVA's Investment funds and increases in interest income due to higher interest rates as compared to the prior year. 
 
 Other Net Periodic Benefit Cost 
 
 Other net periodic benefit cost decreased 101 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the amount of deferred pension costs recognized. As a result of plan design changes, future contributions are expected to exceed the expense under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, TVA discontinued this regulatory accounting practice as all such deferred costs were recovered as of September 30, 2023. In addition, Other net periodic benefit cost is subject to significant economic assumptions, such as changes in the discount rate used to measure the benefit plans, that can materially impact TVA. See Note 20 Benefit Plans . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 TVA depends on various sources of liquidity to meet cash needs and contingencies. TVA's primary sources of liquidity 
 are cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of short-term debt in the form of discount notes, along with periodic 
 issuances of long-term debt. TVA's balance of short-term debt typically changes frequently as TVA issues discount notes to 
 meet short-term cash needs and pay scheduled maturities of discount notes and long-term debt. TVA's next significant power bond maturity is 1.0 billion in May 2025. The periodic amounts of short-term debt issued are determined by near-term expectations for cash receipts, cash expenditures, and funding needs, while seeking to maintain a target range of cash and cash equivalents on hand. TVA may hold higher cash balances from time to time in response to potential market volatility or other business conditions. In addition, cash balances may include collateral received from counterparties. 
 
 In addition to cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of short-term and long-term debt, TVA's sources of liquidity include four long-term revolving credit facilities totaling 2.7 billion, a 150 million credit facility with the United States Department of the Treasury ("U.S. Treasury"), and proceeds from other financings. See Note 14 Debt and Other Obligations Credit Facility Agreements. The TVA Board authorized TVA to issue power bonds and enter into other financing arrangements in an aggregate amount not to exceed 4.0 billion during 2025. In the fourth quarter of 2024, TVA issued 1.0 billion of power bonds maturing in August 2034. Other financing arrangements may include, but are not limited to, lease financings, energy prepayments from customers, and other similar agreements. TVA may also engage in other alternative forms of financing such as sales of receivables, or loans, from time to time. 
 
 The TVA Act authorizes TVA to issue Bonds in an amount not to exceed 30.0 billion outstanding at any time. Bonds outstanding, excluding unamortized discounts and premiums and net exchange gains from foreign currency transactions, at September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 20.2 billion (including current maturities) and 19.5 billion (including current maturities), respectively. The balance of Bonds outstanding directly affects TVA's capacity to meet operational liquidity needs and to strategically use Bonds to fund certain capital investments as management and the TVA Board may deem desirable. Other options for financing not subject to the limit on Bonds, including lease financings (see Lease Financings below and Note 11 
 70 

Table of Contents 

 Variable Interest Entities ), could provide supplementary funding if needed. Currently, TVA expects to utilize a combination of Bonds and additional power revenues through power rate increases to meet its ongoing operational liquidity needs while making planned capital investments through the decade. TVA may also utilize available funding through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("Inflation Reduction Act") and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law ("BIL"), other federal funding opportunities, or other third-party financing arrangements. See Lease Financing s, Key Initiatives and Challenges Optimum Energy Portfolio Decarbonization , Note 11 Variable Interest Entities , and Note 14 Debt and Other Obligations for additional information. 
 
 TVA may from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, TVA's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 
 Debt Securities . TVA's Bonds are not obligations of the U.S., and the U.S. does not guarantee the payments of principal or interest on Bonds. TVA's Bonds consist of power bonds and discount notes. Power bonds have maturities of between one and 50 years. At September 30, 2024, the average maturity of long-term power bonds was 13.96 years, and the weighted average interest rate was 4.69 percent. Discount notes have maturities of less than one year. Power bonds and discount notes have a first priority and equal claim of payment out of net power proceeds. Net power proceeds are defined as the remainder of TVA's gross power revenues after deducting the costs of operating, maintaining, and administering its power properties and tax equivalents, but before deducting depreciation accruals or other charges representing the amortization of capital expenditures, plus the net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any power facility or interest therein. In addition to power bonds and discount notes, TVA had long-term debt associated with certain VIEs outstanding at September 30, 2024. See Lease Financing below, Note 11 Variable Interest Entities , and Note 14 Debt and Other Obligations for additional information. 
 
 Power bonds and discount notes are both issued pursuant to Section 15d of the TVA Act and pursuant to the Basic Tennessee Valley Authority Power Bond Resolution adopted by the TVA Board on October 6, 1960, as amended on September 28, 1976, October 17, 1989, and March 25, 1992 (the "Basic Resolution"). The TVA Act and the Basic Resolution each contain two bond tests: the rate test and the bondholder protection test. 
 
 Under the rate test, TVA must charge rates for power which will produce gross revenues sufficient to provide funds for operation, maintenance, and administration of its power system; tax equivalents; debt service on outstanding Bonds; payments to the U.S. Treasury in repayment of and as a return on the government's appropriation investment in TVA's power facilities (the "Power Program Appropriation Investment"); and such additional margin as the TVA Board may consider desirable for investment in power system assets, retirement of outstanding Bonds in advance of maturity, additional reduction of the Power Program Appropriation Investment, and other purposes connected with TVA's power business, having due regard for the primary objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective that power shall be sold at rates as low as are feasible. See Note 23 Related Parties . 
 
 The rate test for the one-year period ended September 30, 2024, was calculated after the end of 2024, and TVA met the test's requirements. 
 
 Under the bondholder protection test, TVA must, in successive five-year periods, use an amount of net power proceeds at least equal to the sum of the depreciation accruals and other charges representing the amortization of capital expenditures and the net proceeds from any disposition of power facilities, for either the reduction of its capital obligations (including Bonds and the Power Program Appropriation Investment) or investment in power assets. 
 
 The bondholder protection test for the five-year period ended September 30, 2020, was calculated after the end of 2020, and TVA met the test's requirements. TVA must next meet the bondholder protection test for the five-year period ending September 30, 2025, and expects to meet the test. 
 
 TVA uses proceeds from the issuance of discount notes, in addition to other sources of liquidity, to fund short-term cash needs and scheduled maturities of long-term debt.

 TVA ended the year at September 30, 2024, with a higher balance of short-term debt as compared to September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher redemptions of long-term debt compared to the previous year, and the timing of cash flows. 
 
 TVA generally uses proceeds from the issuance of power bonds to refinance maturing power bonds or other financing obligations, as necessary, or for other power system purposes. The total balance of power bonds may decline in periods where redemptions of power bonds exceed issuance due to net positive cash flow from operating and investing activities. At this time, TVA anticipates the balance of Bonds and other financing obligations will increase in future years due to an expected increase in capital expenditures. 
 
 TVA issued 1.0 billion of power bonds during both 2024 and 2023. TVA redeemed 1.0 billion and 29 million of power bonds during 2024 and 2023, respectively. For additional information about TVA debt issuance activity and debt instruments issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 2023, including rates, maturities, outstanding principal amounts, and redemption features, see Note 14 Debt and Other Obligations Debt Securities Activity and Debt Outstanding . 
 
 TVA Bonds are traded in the public bond markets and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") except for TVA's discount notes, the 2009 Series B power bonds, and the power bonds issued under TVA's electronotes program. TVA's Putable Automatic Rate Reset Securities ("PARRS") are traded on the NYSE under the exchange symbols "TVC" and "TVE." Other bonds listed on the NYSE are assigned various symbols by the exchange, which may be noted on the NYSE's website. TVA has also listed certain bonds on foreign exchanges from time to time, including the Luxembourg, Hong Kong, and Singapore Stock Exchanges. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors Financial, Economic, and Market Risks for additional information regarding the market for TVA's Bonds. 
 
 Although TVA Bonds are not obligations of the U.S., TVA, as a corporate agency and instrumentality of the U.S. government, may be impacted if the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. are downgraded. According to statements made by the credit rating agencies, the U.S. credit rating may face additional downward pressure if policymakers are unable to respond to the country's growing fiscal challenges, if it appears deterioration in debt affordability or fiscal strength is likely to undermine U.S. economic strength or the role of the U.S. dollar or U.S. Treasury bond market, or if a weakening of governance were to occur. Additionally, TVA may be impacted by how the U.S. government addresses situations of approaching its debt limit. The outlook on the ratings of TVA is currently stable with S P Global Ratings ("S P") and Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch"); however, the outlook on TVA's ratings from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") is negative due to Moody's change in the U.S. government rating outlook. TVA's rated senior unsecured Bonds are currently rated Aaa, AA+, and AA+, by Moody's, Fitch, and S P, respectively. TVA's short-term discount notes are not rated. TVA is not able to predict the outcome of any rating changes on the U.S. government or any actions that may be taken on TVA because of actions on the government. 
 
 Lease Financings . TVA has entered into certain leasing transactions with special purpose entities ("SPEs") to obtain third-party financing for its facilities. These SPEs are sometimes identified as VIEs of which TVA is determined to be the primary beneficiary. TVA is required to account for these VIEs on a consolidated basis. See Note 11 Variable Interest Entities. In addition, TVA previously entered into leasing transactions to obtain third-party financing for 24 peaking CTs as well as certain qualified technological equipment and software ("QTE"). See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information about reacquired rights associated with these lease financing activities.

 Summary Cash Flows 
 
 A major source of TVA's liquidity is operating cash flows resulting from the generation and sale of electricity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled 523 million and 521 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A summary of cash flow components for the years ended September 30 follows: 
 
 Cash provided by (used in): 

Operating Activities . TVA's cash flows from operations are primarily driven by sales of electricity, fuel expense, and operating and maintenance expense. The timing and level of cash flows from operations can be affected by the weather, changes in working capital, commodity price fluctuations, outages, and other project expenses. 
 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased 131 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to lower fuel prices and purchased power payments. This increase was partially offset by lower revenue collections and higher payroll and benefit related payments compared to the same period of the prior year. Revenue collections decreased primarily due to lower fuel and purchased power prices that were partially offset by the wholesale base rate increase that began in 2024, pandemic credits which ended in September 2023, and higher sales volume. 
 
 Investing Activities . The majority of TVA's investing cash flows are due to investments to acquire, upgrade, or maintain generating and transmission assets, including environmental projects and the purchase of nuclear fuel. 
 
 Net cash flows used in investing activities increased 597 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increased expenditures for capacity expansion projects partially offset by decreased expenditures for nuclear fuel during the period. Nuclear fuel expenditures vary depending on the number of outages and the prices and timing of purchases of uranium and enrichment services. 
 
 Financing Activities . TVA's cash flows provided by or used in financing activities are primarily driven by the timing and level of cash flows provided by operating activities, cash flows used in investing activities, and net issuance and redemption of debt instruments to maintain a strategic balance of cash on hand. 
 
 Net cash flows provided by financing activities increased 467 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher net short-term debt issuances for capacity expansion projects. Higher net cash flows provided by operating activities were offset by higher net cash used in investing activities which resulted in the need for net debt issuances to maintain targeted cash balance levels during the period. TVA anticipates a need to increase debt in the coming years as it continues to invest in power system assets, which may result in positive net cash flows provided by financing activities in future periods.

 Notes 
 (1) Currently, TVA expects to utilize a combination of Bonds and additional power revenues through power rate increases to meet its ongoing operational liquidity needs while making planned capital investments through the decade. TVA may also utilize available funding through the Inflation Reduction Act and the BIL, other federal funding opportunities, or other third-party financing arrangements. Estimated capital expenditures only include expenditures that are currently planned. Additional expenditures may be required, among other things, for TVA to meet growth in demand for power in its service area or to comply with new environmental laws, regulations, or orders. 
 (2) The table includes the capital portion of estimated environmental expenditures. See Part I, Item 1, Business Environmental Matters Estimated Required Environmental Expenditures for total estimates on projects related to environmental laws and regulations. 
 (3) Other capital expenditures are primarily associated with short lead time construction projects aimed at the continued safe and reliable operation of generating assets. 
 (4) The numbers above include the change in construction in progress and nuclear fuel expenditures included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 348 million. 
 
 TVA continually reviews its capital expenditures and financing programs. The amounts shown in the table above are forward-looking amounts based on a number of assumptions and are subject to various uncertainties. Amounts may differ materially based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in assumptions about system load growth, environmental regulation, rates of inflation, total cost of major projects, and availability and cost of external sources of capital. See Forward-Looking Information and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors . 
 
 TVA has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments, including contracts executed in connection with certain of the planned construction expenditures. TVA estimates total commitments and contingencies at September 30, 2024, are approximately 6.8 billion for the year ended September 30, 2025, and 47 billion for the years thereafter, of which 3.9 billion and 22.1 billion, respectively, are set forth in the table below. See Note 8 Leases , Note 11 Variable Interest Entities , Note 14 Debt and Other Obligations , Note 20 Benefit Plans, and Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies for the obligations and commitments attributable to leases, VIEs and membership interests of VIEs subject to mandatory redemption, debt and leaseback obligations, the retirement plan, and unconditional purchase obligations, respectively, for remaining amounts.

 (4) Primarily includes long-term service contracts, contracts that contain minimum purchase levels for the purchase of limestone along with related storage and transportation, and contractual obligations related to TVA's load control program. 
 
 EnergyRight Program. TVA purchases certain loans receivable from its LPCs in association with the EnergyRight program. Depending on the nature of the energy-efficiency project, loans may have a maximum term of five years or 10 years. The loans receivable are then transferred to a third-party bank with which TVA has agreed to repay in full any loan receivable that has been in default for 180 days or more or that TVA has determined is uncollectible. At September 30, 2024, the total carrying amount of the loans receivable, net of discount, was 56 million. Such amounts are not reflected in the Other Commitments and Contingencies table above. The total carrying amount of the financing obligation was 66 million at September 30, 2024. See Note 9 Other Long-Term Assets and Note 12 Other Long-Term Liabilities for additional information. 

Key Initiatives and Challenges 
 
 Optimum Energy Portfolio 
 
 TVA must continuously evaluate all generation and transmission assets to ensure an optimal energy portfolio that provides safe, clean, and reliable power while maintaining flexibility and fiscal responsibility to the people of the Tennessee Valley. 
 Additional load growth for the foreseeable future is expected to challenge capacity position. New capacity will be needed to support this load growth, replace retiring and expiring capacity, and enable further electrification of the economy. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources , at this time, TVA anticipates the balance of Bonds and other financing obligations will increase in future years due to an expected increase in capital expenditures. In addition, TVA expects inflationary pressures to persist in 2025. See Supply Chain and Inflation Pressures below. To ensure TVA continues to provide affordable, reliable, and clean energy, it will need to be efficient in managing its operating costs and is undertaking a cost optimization project designed to reduce planned cost increases by approximately 950 million from 2024-2026 to address these pressures. 
 
 TVA is making investments in its generating portfolio and infrastructure to both help meet the growing demand for electricity and modernize the fleet while also allowing TVA to maintain competitive rates and high reliability and work toward an increasingly clean power system. As TVA continues to evaluate the impact of retiring its coal-fired fleet by 2035 and works to accelerate the growth of renewables, it also continues to evaluate adding flexible lower carbon-emitting gas plants as a strategy to maintain reliability. TVA is also evaluating other capacity expansion projects, and in the third quarter of 2024, TVA issued a request for proposal ("RFP") for capacity for terms through December 2029. TVA is currently evaluating proposals related to the RFP. In addition, TVA is committed to investing in the future of nuclear with the evaluation of emerging advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors ("SMRs"), and is increasing its renewable energy portfolio by securing PPAs and developing projects such as TVA's Self-Directed Solar. It is also investing in research and development for decarbonization technologies including battery storage, carbon capture, carbon sequestration and utilization, new hydroelectric pumped-storage, energy efficiency, demand response, electrification, commercial resiliency, and hydrogen. 
 
 TVA is working with stakeholders and the public on the 2025 Integrated Resource Plan ("IRP"), a comprehensive plan that will help shape TVA's energy system through 2050. TVA is also preparing an EIS to evaluate the impacts associated with the IRP in alignment with the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). The draft IRP and EIS were published on September 23, 2024. TVA will be holding in-person meetings across the region and public webinars to gather feedback during the public comment period, which runs through December 11, 2024. TVA will review and evaluate public input and conduct further analysis to appropriately incorporate feedback provided during the public comment period. Public comments on the draft IRP and EIS will be addressed in the final EIS. The final IRP, which is expected to be published in 2025, will include power supply mix ranges, recommendations for strategic portfolio direction through 2035, and information on factors that will influence portfolio direction from 2035 to 2050. The final IRP is expected to be presented to the TVA Board in 2025 for its consideration of the IRP recommendations. 
 
 TVA continues to evaluate and pursue funding opportunities under the Inflation Reduction Act and the BIL to help offset the cost of qualifying projects. In many cases, TVA is directly or indirectly eligible to seek BIL funded opportunities through agency-sponsored and implemented funding opportunities. The Inflation Reduction Act makes certain tax-exempt entities, including TVA, eligible for a direct-pay option for certain tax credits for clean energy generation projects. Projects eligible for funding under the Inflation Reduction Act or the BIL tend to be capital intensive. In addition, the funding legislation requires TVA to expend large sums of its own funds before becoming eligible to receive funding. For example, grant programs typically require at least a 50 percent cost share, and the Inflation Reduction Act credits may cover only about 30 percent to 40 percent of qualified basis of projects, generally received as a tax refund the year following when the project is placed in service. In addition, obtaining this funding often requires TVA to meet certain additional requirements, to submit information returns to the IRS, and to retain adequate books and records to support its filings. For TVA to receive direct pay under the Inflation Reduction Act for projects beginning construction on or after January 1, 2026, TVA will be required to meet domestic content requirements, unless a cost or availability exception applies. While meeting these requirements would automatically qualify the project for a 10 percent addition to the base credit, the cost of complying with these requirements may exceed this additional bonus. 
 
 TVA has established a Federal Funding Project Management Office FFPMO that governs and supports TVA s federal funding strategy to help position TVA and Tennessee Valley partners to leverage funding from the Inflation Reduction Act and the BIL. The FFPMO is responsible for overseeing opportunities, assessing TVA's BIL and Inflation Reduction Act eligibility, 
 75 

Table of Contents 

 prioritizing and coordinating proposal development, and seeking to capture funding opportunities for TVA. The FFPMO also acts as a conduit for LPCs and business partners to potentially access the Inflation Reduction Act and BIL funds. TVA is currently exploring funding opportunities of various types, including opportunities involving pumped-storage, solar, carbon capture, hydrogen, energy efficiency, and transmission, among others. This exploration does not guarantee that TVA or its partners will receive funds. 
 
 In October 2024, a TVA-led coalition that includes 10 LPCs was selected by the Department of Energy to enter negotiations for the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership grant. This 250 million grant would provide for more than 80 TVA and LPC transmission projects to increase grid capacity, mitigate extreme weather risks, and expedite development of clean energy projects. TVA is also currently pursuing efforts to claim Inflation Reduction Act credits. 
 
 Coal-Fired Fleet. TVA is evaluating the impact of retiring the balance of the coal-fired fleet by 2035. TVA will prepare environmental reviews pursuant to NEPA prior to making a decision on retiring or building any plant. TVA plans to retire the two coal-fired units at Cumberland, which at September 30, 2024, accounted for 2,470 MW of TVA's summer net capability. TVA plans to replace generation for one unit with a 1,450 MW combined cycle plant that is expected to be operational by the end of CY 2026 when the first unit is scheduled to be retired. The second unit is scheduled to be retired by the end of CY 2028, and in May 2023, TVA published the notice of intent to conduct an EIS to study potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed construction and operation of facilities to replace part of that generation. See Natural Gas-Fired Units below. 
 
 In 2023, TVA made available to the public a draft EIS to assess the impacts associated with the potential retirement of Kingston and the construction and operation of facilities to replace that generation. The final EIS was published in February 2024, and TVA documented its final decision with the Record of Decision on April 2, 2024. TVA plans to retire the nine coal-fired units at Kingston by the end of CY 2027 and replace the retired generation with an energy complex that includes 1,500 MW of natural gas, 100 MW of battery storage, and 3-4 MW of solar. See Natural Gas-Fired Units below. TVA expects to issue an RFP in the future for the battery storage and solar related to the energy complex. 
 
 Natural Gas-Fired Units. As TVA continues to evaluate the impact of retiring its coal-fired fleet by 2035 and works to accelerate the growth of renewables, it also continues to evaluate adding flexible lower carbon-emitting gas plants as a strategy to maintain reliability. During 2019, the TVA Board approved an expansion of peaking gas replacement capacity at the Paradise facility. Pre-commercial plant operations began on Paradise CTs 5-7 in the first quarter of 2024, and the units became operational on December 29, 2023, with a total summer net capability of 681 MW. As of September 30, 2024 , TVA had spent 394 million on this expansion. 
 
 A 500 MW aeroderivative CT project at TVA s Johnsonville site has been approved for 619 million, contingent on the successful completion of environmental reviews under NEPA and other applicable laws. TVA completed the NEPA review and received the air permits for the Johnsonville facility, and as of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 568 million on this project. TVA expects to spend an additional 51 million on this project and anticipates the project will enter commercial operations in the third quarter of 2025. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings Case Involving Johnsonville Aeroderivative Combustion Turbine Project for a discussion of a lawsuit involving this project. See Note 24 Subsequent Events for financing related to this project. 
 
 As discussed in Coal-Fired Fleet above, TVA is replacing generation for one unit at Cumberland with a 1,450 MW combined cycle plant that is expected to be operational by the end of CY 2026. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 945 million on this project, and expects to spend an additional 1.2 billion through CY 2026. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 48 million on long lead time equipment in connection with the potential project to replace generation for the second unit at Cumberland. However, this equipment could be used at other TVA sites if the final project is not approved. TVA could spend up to an additional 1.4 billion on this potential project. 
 
 To operate the Cumberland Combined Cycle Plant, TVA has contracted for the transportation of gas from a gas pipeline that will need to be constructed. Numerous permits from various state and federal agencies are required for construction of the pipeline. Two cases are currently pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ("Sixth Circuit"), one challenging the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation s order issuing a water quality certification under 401 of the Clean Water Act CWA for construction of the pipeline and one challenging the Army Corps of Engineers issuance of a permit for construction pursuant to 404 of the CWA. On October 11, 2024, the Sixth Circuit issued an order staying the permit in each respective case until the court can review the merits of these cases. The court is scheduled to review the merits on December 10, 2024. A case is also pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit challenging FERC s issuance of a certificate for the pipeline. While TVA is not a party in these cases, they could result in delays to commercial operation of the Cumberland facility or may lead to additional costs if the gas pipeline must be constructed in an alternate location than is currently planned. TVA is currently unable to predict the outcome of these cases. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings Case Involving Cumberland Combined Cycle Plant for a discussion of another lawsuit involving this project. 
 
 As discussed in Coal-Fired Fleet above, TVA is constructing a 1,500 MW combined cycle plant that is expected to be operational by the end of CY 2027. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 662 million on this project and expects to spend 
 76 

Table of Contents 

 an additional 2.1 billion through CY 2027. To operate the Kingston combined cycle plant, TVA will contract for the transportation of gas from a gas pipeline that will need to be constructed. 
 
 TVA is continuing to explore a 500 MW New Caledonia simple cycle CT project on TVA land contingent on the successful completion of environmental reviews under NEPA and other applicable laws . The draft EIS for New Caledonia was made available for public comment in July 2024, and the final EIS is expected to be published in 2025. As of September 30, 2024 , TVA had spent 121 million on the New Caledonia project and could spend up to an additional 427 million. TVA is also exploring a 200 MW aeroderivative CT project at TVA's Allen site. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 190 million on the project at Allen and could spend up to an additional 163 million. Finally, TVA is exploring a potential project at Lagoon Creek. 
 
 Decarbonization. TVA's decarbonization initiative is aimed at understanding and applying clean resources to support the reduction of carbon emissions from its power supply. Related to its carbon reduction efforts, TVA has established six guiding principles which are as follows: 
 
 Prioritize the needs of Tennessee Valley stakeholders as TVA works to achieve its goals by maintaining low rates and high reliability, and attracting new jobs in the Tennessee Valley. 
 
 Use best-available science and support research and policies that further carbon-free dispatchable technologies. 
 
 Partner with LPCs and other customers and communities to support economy-wide decarbonization efforts and the strategic electrification of other sectors, such as transportation. 
 
 Maintain nuclear generation, hydro generation, and a strong transmission grid as key enabling assets. 
 
 Be transparent with stakeholders in measuring and sharing TVA's progress, and listen and work effectively with all its stakeholders to understand their priorities and needs. 
 
 Adapt to new technologies and changing policies, and be willing and open to changing TVA's plans and projects to achieve deep carbon reduction. 
 
 TVA has partnered with the University of Tennessee Baker School for Public Policy and Public Affairs and with diverse stakeholders from across the Tennessee Valley to conduct a Valley Pathways Study, which is focused on building a competitive and clean economy for the Tennessee Valley. This study examines potential scenarios for all economic sectors across the Tennessee Valley that will support sustainable growth and a viable and preferred decarbonization pathway. The preliminary findings from the Valley Pathways Study were released in February 2024. 
 
 As part of the decarbonization efforts, in 2022, the TVA Board approved a programmatic approach to exploring advanced nuclear technology, which is one of several technologies TVA is exploring. Other decarbonization technologies TVA is exploring in addition to advanced nuclear include battery storage, carbon capture, carbon sequestration and utilization, new hydroelectric pumped-storage, energy efficiency, demand response, electrification, commercial resiliency, and hydrogen. TVA also is increasing its renewable energy portfolio to work towards carbon emission reductions and meet customer preferences by investing in existing assets, encouraging renewable power through various current programs and offerings, and securing renewable PPAs through RFPs, among others. See below, Part I, Item 1, Business Power Supply and Load Management Resources Renewable Energy Resources and Community Energy Portfolio , and Part I, Item 1, Business Research and Development for further discussion of TVA's decarbonization efforts. See also Part I, Item 1, Business Environmental Matters Climate Change for a discussion of the impact of executive actions and climate-related regulations on TVA. 
 
 Renewable Power Purchase Agreements . In recent years, TVA has issued RFPs in order to meet customer preferences and requirements for cleaner energy. TVA will procure the renewable energy and sell the resulting 
 RECs to specific customers, allowing TVA to increase renewable energy in the Tennessee Valley without additional costs to other TVA customers. These agreements help to align the core values of TVA and the public power model with the desire of TVA's customers for renewable energy. TVA issued a carbon-free RFP in 2022, and during 2024, TVA signed six power purchase agreements totaling 991 MW of solar generation and 220 MW of battery storage capacity from the carbon-free RFP that are expected to come online by the end of CY 2028. 
 
 TVA s existing solar PPA portfolio is not immune from the challenges affecting the U.S. solar industry. Similar to the experience of the rest of the industry, the majority of TVA s contracted PPAs from previous RFPs that are not yet online have been impacted by project delays and price increases. 
 
 Self-Directed Solar. During 2019, the TVA Board approved the opportunity for TVA to explore being directly involved in the development of a utility-scale solar project, contingent on the successful completion of environmental reviews under NEPA and other applicable laws. In 2021, TVA purchased land for this development, and in 2022, environmental reviews were completed. The challenges affecting TVA s RFPs are also being seen in TVA's Self-Directed Solar project. The project has experienced delays and cost increases due to escalations from supply chain limitations. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 53 million on the 200 MW project. TVA has elected to pursue a competitive selection process with third parties for the 
 77 

Table of Contents 

 development of the photovoltaic solar facility to be located on the site. TVA plans to enter into a long-term PPA to purchase the energy generated by the facility. An RFP has been issued to this effect, and selection of the awardee is anticipated in early CY 2025. 
 
 In November 2022, the TVA Board approved the opportunity for TVA to explore the development of an additional utility-scale solar project, contingent on successfully completing environmental reviews under the NEPA and other applicable laws and obtaining the necessary state permits. The project would utilize TVA land, deploying a solar cap system on the closed CCR facility at the TVA Shawnee Fossil Plant in Paducah, Kentucky. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 56 million on the 99 MW project and expects to spend an additional 206 million. 
 
 Small Modular Reactors . In December 2019, TVA became the first utility in the nation to successfully obtain approval for an early site permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") to potentially construct and operate SMRs at TVA s Clinch River Nuclear Site. The permit is valid through 2039 and therefore provides TVA a great deal of flexibility to make new nuclear decisions based on energy needs and economic factors. In 2021, TVA initiated a Programmatic EIS ("PEIS") that evaluated a variety of alternatives for a proposed advanced nuclear technology park at the Clinch River Nuclear Site and will provide additional flexibility for future decision making. The Record of Decision was signed in 2022. 
 
 The TVA Board has approved up to 350 million to explore advanced reactor technology options under the New Nuclear Program. Of this amount, TVA had spent 196 million as of September 30, 2024. The New Nuclear Program provides a systematic roadmap for TVA s exploration of advanced nuclear technology. Collaboration with other interested parties will be an important aspect of this program, and TVA has entered into several agreements with technology progressive organizations that allow for mutual collaboration to explore advanced reactor designs as a next-generation nuclear technology. In December 2022, TVA entered into a multi-party collaborative arrangement to advance the global deployment of the GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy ("GEH") BWRX-300 SMR. GEH is responsible for standard design development. See Note 21 Collaborative Arrangement for additional information. One of the first tasks the New Nuclear Program is pursuing is a project to develop an NRC construction permit application at the Clinch River Nuclear Site. In addition, while evaluating alternatives for potential advanced nuclear at the Clinch River Nuclear Site, TVA is exploring the feasibility of applying a similar approach that could deploy additional SMRs at Clinch River and other TVA-owned properties. 
 
 The decision to potentially build SMRs continues to be part of the ongoing discussion as part of the asset strategy for TVA s future generation portfolio, and any future decision to construct any reactor, advanced or otherwise, would require approval by the TVA Board and the NRC. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 287 million to date on work regarding SMRs, including work to complete the early site permit application for the Clinch River Nuclear Site and work associated with the New Nuclear Program above. Of these amounts, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") had reimbursed TVA 29 million. Additional expenditures will be determined based on future project development. 
 
 Nuclear Fleet License Extensions . Subject to the completion of all appropriate environmental reviews, TVA is seeking to renew all nuclear generation units' licenses for an additional 20 years. The first license renewal application was submitted to the NRC in January 2024 for the three units at Browns Ferry following the completion of a Supplemental EIS prepared by TVA to assess the environmental impacts associated with renewing the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant licenses. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 32 million to support the subsequent license renewal ("SLR") of the three units at Browns Ferry and expects to spend up to an additional 10 million to complete the Browns Ferry SLR. 
 
 Fiber Optic Network . In 2017, the TVA Board authorized up to 300 million to be spent over the next 10 years, subject to annual budget availability and necessary environmental reviews, to build an enhanced fiber optic network that will better connect TVA's operational assets. Fiber is a vital part of TVA's modern communication infrastructure. The new fiber optic lines will improve the reliability and resiliency of the generation and transmission system while enabling the system to better accommodate distributed energy resources ("DER") as they enter the market. As of September 30, 2024 , TVA had spent 266 million on installation of the fiber optic lines and expects to spend an additional 34 million through 2027. 
 
 System Operations Center . A new system operations center was approved by the TVA Board. The new secured facility is being built to accommodate a new energy management system and adapt to new regulatory requirements, and will improve reliability, have improved physical security from the previous center, and be flexible to help accommodate operational growth requirements, including future renewables. Construction of the facility is expected to be complete in CY 2024, and the facility is expected to be fully operational in CY 2026. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 307 million on the project and expects to spend an additional 25 million. 
 
 Energy Management System. A new energy management system was approved by the TVA Board. As the current energy management system is nearing the end of its life cycle, this project will replace the existing analog system with a digital system. The new digital system will have higher capacity and speed for communications with the TVA grid and for inputs from monitoring equipment, will network the new control center with existing locations, and will enable better remote visibility and control to help mitigate reliability implications of climate change. The system is expected to be complete in CY 2027. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 76 million on the project and expects to spend an additional 32 million.

 Automated Energy Exchange Platform. In October 2021, an automated energy exchange, the Southeast Energy Exchange Market ("SEEM"), took effect. The exchange was created to facilitate more short-term power exchanges and will be an enhancement to the existing market. TVA completed the appropriate environmental reviews, and during the third quarter of 2022, the TVA Board approved the creation of a zero-cost, non-firm transmission service to allow TVA to participate in SEEM. In November 2022, the SEEM market began transacting. 
 
 In July 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("D.C. Circuit") remanded the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ("FERC") approval of SEEM, sending the matter back to FERC for additional proceedings. On December 17, 2023, the petitioners filed another appeal on the theory that FERC's failure to act promptly after the D.C. Circuit's remand created a new appealable event. On June 14, 2024, in response to the D.C. Circuit's remand directives, FERC issued an order directing the parties to submit briefs to supplement the record on the issues of whether SEEM is a loose power pool and whether SEEM's geographic requirement violates the open access principles of FERC Order No. 888. The SEEM market is continuing to transact pending the disposition of the legal challenges. 
 
 Electric Vehicles 
 
 TVA is partnering with LPCs and others to support the electrification of transportation in the Tennessee Valley in a multi-year electric vehicle ("EV") initiative. The initiative focuses on reducing or eliminating EV market barriers by setting EV policies, improving charging infrastructure availability, expanding EV availability and offerings, and spreading EV consumer awareness. In 2021, the TVA Board approved new policies and an optional wholesale EV rate aimed at encouraging the development of charging infrastructure in the Tennessee Valley. The updated policies enable LPC investment in public charging infrastructure and allow for the conditional resale of electricity, for transportation purposes only, by any charging developer on a /kWh basis. The optional wholesale rate was developed with high power EV charging in mind and provides a stable option for those developing charging infrastructure. 
 
 TVA is also working with LPCs, state agencies, and third-party charging developers to create the Fast Charge Network. This will be a foundational network of public fast charging stations at least every 50 miles along interstates and major highways across its seven -state service area. In 2021, TVA began a partnership with the State of Tennessee for the development and funding of Fast Charge Tennessee, the portion of the Fast Charge Network that covers Tennessee, and in 2022 TVA launched the Fast Charge Network. As of September 30, 2024, 39 sites were complete and operational with 39 additional sites under contract for development. TVA had spent 7 million on fast charging network charging stations as of September 30, 2024. TVA also plans to electrify 100 percent of its light-duty and 50 percent of its medium-duty vehicles in the TVA fleet. The adoption of EVs in the Tennessee Valley continues to grow, and TVA is working to ensure that the benefits of this rapid growth are secured, while also helping LPCs proactively avoid issues in their distribution systems. Also in 2021, TVA and five other major utilities formed the Electric Highway Coalition to develop a network of fast charging stations along all major highway routes within their service area. Since formation, the Electric Highway Coalition has gained significant interest from additional utilities and other EV collaboratives. In 2022, the Electric Highway Coalition merged with the Midwest Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Collaboration to create the National Electric Highway Coalition with members committed to coordinate the development of EV charging infrastructure across the central U.S. 
 
 Sustainability and Social Responsibility 
 
 Sustainability has been and continues to be a focus in support of TVA's mission to deliver affordable and reliable energy, steward the environment, and create sustainable economic growth. TVA has a Chief Sustainability Officer CSO who oversees an enterprise-wide Sustainability Steering Council and a Sustainability Working Group, which together provide guidance and support for the development of TVA's Sustainability Program. The CSO is also a member of TVA s Risk Management Steering Committee. 
 
 TVA s sustainability work is categorized into five areas: 
 
 Economic Impact Affordable, reliable power supports residents and attracts businesses 
 
 Environment Protecting the region's air, land, water, and historic resources 
 
 Social Investing in communities and employees to uplift all 
 
 Governance Governance enables TVA to build a clean energy future 
 
 Foundational Values most fundamental to carrying out TVA's mission

 TVA issued its 2023 Sustainability Report on May 6, 2024. This comprehensive Sustainability Report aligns with global reporting standards and will serve as a baseline for annual corporate sustainability reporting. TVA also publishes two other sustainability-related documents: a Federal Sustainability Report and Implementation Plan, which addresses TVA's responsibilities related to federal sustainability performance, and an Environmental, Social, and Governance Sustainability Report, which uses a utility-focused and investor-driven reporting template developed by the Edison Electric Institute. TVA also issues other reports related to sustainability and social responsibility, including a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility Report, which highlights the actions TVA has taken in the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility area, the results achieved, and the plans to continue to focus and improve, among other reports. 
 
 Extreme Flooding Preparedness 
 
 Updates to the TVA analytical hydrology model completed in 2009 indicated that under "probable maximum flood" conditions, some of TVA's dams might not have been capable of regulating the higher flood waters. A "probable maximum flood" is an extremely unlikely event; however, TVA has a responsibility to provide protection for its nuclear plants against such events. As a result, TVA installed a series of modifications at four dams. 
 
 Since 2009, TVA has performed further hydrology modeling of portions of the TVA watershed using updated modeling tools. Hydrology models were submitted for Sequoyah Nuclear Plant ("Sequoyah") Units 1 and 2 in 2012. However, concerns regarding TVA dam stability and revised hydrology analyses led to the submittal of a new hydrologic analysis for Sequoyah Units 1 and 2 in 2020. To resolve additional dam stability issues identified later in 2020, TVA submitted a revision to the Sequoyah model in April 2023. The new hydrologic analysis for Sequoyah Units 1 and 2 was approved by the NRC in March 2024. TVA submitted models for Watts Bar Nuclear Plant ("Watts Bar") Units 1 and 2 in December 2023 to incorporate a methodology approved by the NRC subsequent to its review of a previous hydrology submittal for Watts Bar. TVA will subsequently address conditions at Browns Ferry as needed. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 158 million on the modifications and improvements related to extreme flooding preparedness. TVA has concluded that the revised hydraulic modeling and associated submittal of license amendment requests to update the Sequoyah and Watts Bar licensing bases have demonstrated appropriate design margins such that additional flood mitigating systems are no longer needed at these two sites. Therefore, TVA submitted a letter to the NRC in September 2024 to decommit from the commitment to implement an improved flood model mitigation system at these two sites. 
 
 Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Unit 2 
 
 Sequoyah Unit 2 tripped on July 30, 2024, due to failure of the main generator. As a result, the project to restack and rewind the main generator was pulled forward in the Nuclear Life Extension ("NLE") plan. The unit will remain offline until project completion, which is expected in spring 2025. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent 25 million related to this project and expects to spend an additional 57 million. 
 
 Hurricane Helene 
 
 In late September 2024, Hurricane Helene caused significant damage in communities in East Tennessee and Western North Carolina. Flood of record was approached or exceeded in many areas. TVA completed inspections at numerous dams, finding no substantial impacts. Shoreline erosion at Nolichucky Dam did not impact the dam's integrity and has subsequently been repaired. In addition, TVA stored a substantial amount of water in tributary reservoirs that has since been released downstream in a controlled manner to recover flood storage capacity. TVA is working on debris management at Douglas Reservoir to help mitigate potential downstream movement. TVA's efforts may also include aiding other agencies in their recovery efforts, including supporting major disaster declarations with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. TVA is evaluating the financial impact of the storm.

Coal Combustion Residuals 
 
 Coal Combustion Residuals Facilities . TVA is pursuing a programmatic approach to address environmental impacts related to the previous storage and disposal of its CCR in accordance with applicable law CCR Program ). Under the CCR Program, TVA performed stability remediation of all at-risk facilities, completed the conversion of all operational coal-fired plants to dry CCR storage, and ceased operation of wet CCR storage facilities. 
 
 Dry generation and dewatering projects . TVA has accomplished the conversion from wet to dry handling of CCR materials at all operating coal plants with the completion of dry generation and/or dewatering projects at Bull Run, Cumberland, Gallatin Fossil Plant ("Gallatin"), Kingston, and Shawnee Fossil Plant ("Shawnee"). 
 
 Landfills . TVA has made strategic decisions to build and maintain lined and permitted dry storage facilities on TVA-owned property at some TVA locations, enabling these facilities to generate CCR beyond existing dry storage capacity. Lined and permitted landfills are operational at Bull Run, Gallatin, Kingston, and Shawnee. TVA received a State of Tennessee permit for the construction and operation of a new lined landfill at Gallatin, and construction started in 2022. TVA received a State of Tennessee permit for a new lined landfill at Cumberland in 2023, and TVA is currently evaluating the need for construction. Construction of additional lined and dry permitted storage facilities may occur to support future business requirements . 
 
 CCR facilities closures . TVA is working to close CCR facilities in accordance with federal and state requirements. Closure project schedules and costs are driven by the selected closure methodology (such as closure-in-place or closure-by-removal) and regulatory requirements. TVA's predominant closure methodology is currently closure-in-place, with exceptions at certain facilities, although EPA has recently interpreted its CCR Rule in a way that could challenge TVA's predominant closure methodology for many units, thereby potentially creating significant additional costs with implementing closure. TVA issued a PEIS in June 2016 that programmatically evaluated the closure of CCR impoundments at TVA's coal-fired plants. TVA issued its associated Record of Decision in July 2016. The PEIS assessed the potential environmental effects associated with various modes of impoundment closures and through subsequent NEPA documents specifically evaluated and addressed closure methods at 10 impoundments. TVA subsequently decided to close those impoundments. The method of final closure for each of these facilities will depend on various factors, including approval by appropriate state regulators and applicable closure requirements of state and federal regulations. Additional site-specific NEPA studies will be conducted, as warranted, as other facilities are considered for closure. See Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligations . 
 
 Groundwater monitoring . Compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA's") CCR rule ("CCR Rule") requires implementation of a groundwater monitoring program and ongoing analysis. In compliance with the CCR Rule, TVA published the results of the 2023 groundwater testing at its CCR facilities during the second quarter of 2024. Similar to prior years, the tests identified certain CCR units with constituents at statistically significant levels above site-specific groundwater protection standards. TVA has completed an assessment of corrective measures ("ACM"), which analyzes the effectiveness of potential corrective actions, and has published ACM reports to its CCR Rule Compliance Data and Information website. Based on the results of the ACM, TVA is required to select a remedy as soon as feasible. TVA has selected remedies for two of its plants: a groundwater pump and treat system at the Allen East Ash Disposal Area and monitored natural attenuation at Shawnee. TVA continues to investigate and evaluate remedies for its other plants and will continue posting semi-annual progress reports on the status of remedy selection until the final remedy is selected. The cost of these final remedies cannot reasonably be predicted until investigations and evaluations are complete and remedial methods are selected. 
 
 The final Part A revision to the CCR Rule became effective September 28, 2020. Among other things, the final Part A rule requires unlined CCR surface impoundments to stop receiving CCR and non-CCR waste streams and to initiate closure or retrofit by no later than April 11, 2021. TVA ceased sending CCR and non-CCR waste streams to, and initiated closure of, unlined CCR surface impoundments by the specified deadline. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, TVA had spent approximately 3.2 billion on its CCR Program. Through 2029, TVA expects to spend an additional 2.4 billion on the CCR Program. Estimates for these amounts and costs after 2029 may change depending on the final closure method selected for each facility. While the conversion portion of the CCR Program is completed, TVA will continue to undertake CCR closure and storage projects, including building new landfill cells under existing permits and closing existing cells once they reach capacity. 
 
 TVA was involved in two lawsuits concerning the CCR facilities at Gallatin. One of these cases was decided in TVA's favor by the Sixth Circuit, and the other case was resolved by the entry of a consent order and agreement in Davidson County Chancery Court that became effective July 24, 2019. Under the consent order, TVA agreed to close the existing ash facility by removal, either to an on-site landfill or to an offsite facility. TVA may also consider options for beneficial reuse of the CCR. TVA submitted the removal plan for approval to the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation ("TDEC") and other applicable parties pursuant to the consent order, which was approved on November 7, 2023. In addition, TVA submitted an Environmental Assessment Report ("EAR") to TDEC, and TDEC approved the EAR on June 6, 2023. TVA submitted the Gallatin Ash Pond Complex Corrective Action/Risk Assessment ("CARA") Plan to TDEC in January 2024. See Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligations .

Table of Contents 

 In October 2019, TDEC released amendments to its regulations which govern solid waste disposal facilities, including TVA's active CCR facilities covered by a solid waste disposal permit and those which closed pursuant to a TDEC approved closure plan. Such facilities are generally subject to a 30-year post-closure care period during which the owner or operator must undertake certain activities, including monitoring and maintaining the facility. The amendments, among other things, add an additional 50-year period after the end of the post-closure care period, require TVA to submit recommendations as to what activities must be performed during this 50-year period to protect human health and the environment, and require TVA to submit revised closure plans every 10 years. 
 
 On May 8, 2024, EPA published its Legacy CCR Rule, which expands the scope of the existing regulatory requirements of the 2015 CCR Rule to include two additional classes of units: Legacy SIs and CCRMUs. As a result of the enactment of the final rule, during 2024, TVA recorded additional estimated AROs of 3.1 billion and recorded a corresponding regulatory asset of 3.1 billion due to these AROs being associated with closed sites and asset retirement costs having been fully depreciated. These amounts are forward-looking and are subject to various uncertainties, and actual amounts may differ materially based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the outcome of legal challenges to the Legacy CCR Rule, ongoing evaluations of the number and scope of newly regulated units, and determinations on final closure requirements and performance standards. See Part I, Item 1, Business Environmental Matters Cleanup of Solid and Hazardous Wastes Coal Combustion Residuals, Part I, Item 1A , Risk Factors Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks , and Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligations. 
 
 Allen Groundwater Investigation . The CCR Rule required TVA to implement a comprehensive groundwater monitoring program at units subject to the rule. As a result of this groundwater monitoring program, TVA reported to TDEC in 2017 elevated levels of arsenic, lead, and fluoride in groundwater samples collected from two shallow-aquifer groundwater monitoring wells around the Allen East Ash Disposal Area. TVA, under the oversight of TDEC, conducted a remedial investigation into the nature and extent of the contamination. 
 
 The remedial investigation confirmed that the high arsenic, fluoride, and lead concentrations are limited to the shallow alluvial aquifer in the north and south areas of the Allen East Ash Disposal Area. These areas are not adversely impacting the Memphis aquifer, which is the source of the public drinking water supply. All samples taken from the Memphis aquifer through TVA production wells were within the EPA drinking water standards. As the result of a pumping test conducted on TVA production wells at the nearby Allen Combined Cycle Plant ("Allen CC") by the United States Geological Survey and the University of Memphis, TVA has committed to not using these production wells until additional data is generated that supports safe use. TVA constructed water tanks on site and is purchasing cooling water from MLGW in lieu of utilizing the production wells. Purchasing cooling water in combination with the use of water tanks, rather than wells, could impose some operational limitations, such as limitations on capacity, on the Allen CC due to lower availability of cooling water. 
 
 Pursuant to a remedial action plan that has been approved by TDEC, TVA has installed a groundwater pump and treat system at the Allen East Ash Disposal Area. In addition, TVA is taking steps to close both the East Ash Disposal Area and the nearby West Ash Disposal Area at Allen. On November 29, 2021, after obtaining the necessary approvals from TDEC, TVA began removing CCR materials to an offsite, lined landfill, and removal and closure activities are expected to continue through 2030. 
 
 Real Property Portfolio 
 
 TVA engages in ongoing Tennessee Valley-wide real property portfolio evaluations of buildings, structures, and land as part of the strategic real estate program, which focuses on reducing cost, right-sizing the portfolio, and aligning real estate holdings with TVA's strategic direction. In addition, TVA continues to operate in a hybrid work environment for those who do not have to be physically present at a TVA facility. TVA is evaluating its use of the Chattanooga Office Complex and issued an RFP in August 2023 to determine availability for a new Chattanooga, Tennessee facility based on TVA's workplace needs. No final decisions have been made, and TVA is considering multiple options. 
 
 Supply Chain and Inflation Pressures 
 
 TVA continues to experience impacts due to inflation, supply chain material challenges, and labor availability. This has led to project delays, limited availability, and/or price increases for supplies and labor. TVA actively manages supply chain volatility with contracting, inventory strategies, and supplier engagement and support. TVA expects inflationary pressures to persist in 2025. TVA has been able to manage these challenges with limited business disruptions at this time; however, should pressures continue long term, TVA could experience more significant disruptions and pressure to further increase power rates. 
 
 Safeguarding Assets 
 
 Physical Security Non-Nuclear Asset Protection. TVA utilizes a variety of security technologies, security awareness activities, and security personnel to prevent sabotage, vandalism, and thefts. Any of these activities could negatively impact the ability of TVA to generate, transmit, and deliver power to its customers. TVA's Police and Emergency Management personnel are active participants with numerous professional and peer physical security organizations in both the electric industry and law

 enforcement communities. 
 
 TVA works with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation ("NERC"), the SERC Reliability Corporation, the North American Transmission Forum, and other utilities to implement industry approved recommendations and standards. 
 
 Nuclear Security . Nuclear security is carried out in accordance with federal regulations as set forth by the NRC. These regulations are designed for the protection of TVA's nuclear power plants, the public, and employees from the threat of radiological sabotage and other nuclear-related terrorist threats. TVA has security forces to guard against such threats. 
 
 Cybersecurity. TVA operates in a highly regulated environment with respect to cybersecurity. TVA's cybersecurity program aligns or complies with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, the NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection requirements, and the NRC requirements for cybersecurity, as well as industry best practices. As part of the U.S. government, TVA coordinates with and works closely with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ("CISA"). CISA serves as the agency assisting other federal entities in defending against threats and securing critical infrastructure. The U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team functions as a liaison between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the public and private sectors to coordinate responses to security threats. 
 
 The risk of cybersecurity events such as malicious code attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and social engineering 
 attempts is intensifying across all industries, including the energy sector. TVA continues to see increases in malicious activity including phishing campaigns, malicious websites, distributed denial of service attacks, and activity related to business partner compromise, among others. These types of malicious activity have also been observed by TVA's external vendors, stakeholders, and partners, which has caused the need for heightened awareness and preparedness. 
 
 On May 12, 2021, President Biden signed EO 14028, "Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity." This EO is intended to improve the nation's cybersecurity posture and protect federal government networks by improving information-sharing between the U.S. government and the private sector on cyber issues and strengthening the United States' ability to respond to incidents when they occur. This EO is focused on specific goals and requirements including actions for zero trust architectures; cloud services; FedRAMP programs; supply chain and contracts; secure software development; endpoint detection and response, standardized vulnerability, and incident response operational plans; threat and vulnerability analysis; assessment and threat-hunting; event logging, monitoring, and retention; and information sharing. TVA continues to respond to the EO, associated Office of Management and Budget memorandums, and other emerging requirements in alignment with the order. TVA has submitted all reports as required, established response teams and an oversight structure, and initiated projects as necessary to address the required actions. 
 
 See Part I, Item 1C, Cybersecurity for a description of TVA's cybersecurity program and integrated risk management process. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors Cybersecurity and Information Technology Risks TVA's facilities and information infrastructure may not operate as planned due to cyber threats to TVA's assets and operations . 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 TVA's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Each of these estimates varies in regard to the level of judgment involved and its potential impact on TVA's financial results. Estimates are deemed critical either when a different estimate could have reasonably been used, or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, and such use or change also would materially impact TVA's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. TVA's critical accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 TVA believes that its most critical accounting estimates relate to AROs, fair value measurements, and pension and other post-retirement benefits. 
 
 Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of critical accounting estimates with the Audit, Risk, and Cybersecurity Committee of the TVA Board. While TVA's estimates and assumptions are based on its knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions.

 Asset Retirement Obligations 
 
 TVA recognizes legal obligations associated with the future retirement of certain tangible long-lived assets. These obligations relate to TVA's generating facilities, including coal-fired, nuclear, hydroelectric, and natural gas and/or oil-fired. They also pertain to coal ash impoundments, transmission facilities, and other property-related assets. Activities involved with the retirement of these assets could include decontamination and demolition of structures, removal and disposal of wastes, and site restoration. TVA periodically reviews its estimated ARO liabilities. Revisions to the ARO estimates are made whenever factors indicate that the timing or amounts of estimated cash flows have changed. Any change to an ARO liability is recognized prospectively as an equivalent increase or decrease in the carrying value of the capitalized asset. Any accretion or depreciation expense related to these liabilities and assets is charged to a regulatory asset. See Note 10 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Nuclear Decommissioning Costs and Non-Nuclear Decommissioning Costs and Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligations for explanations of changes in estimates. 
 
 The initial obligation is measured at its estimated fair value using various judgments and assumptions. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique that is based on assumptions of market participants and that considers estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated decommissioning date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the value of the AROs could result in different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements, including amortization of the regulatory assets. 
 
 Nuclear Decommissioning . Decommissioning cost studies are updated for each of TVA's nuclear unit's long-lived assets at least every five years. At September 30, 2024, the estimated future nuclear decommissioning cost recognized in the financial statements was 3.8 billion and was included in AROs, and the unamortized regulatory asset related to nuclear decommissioning ARO costs of 362 million was included in Regulatory assets. 
 
 The following key assumptions can have a significant effect on estimates related to the nuclear decommissioning costs reported in TVA's nuclear ARO liability: 
 
 Timing and Method In projecting decommissioning costs, two assumptions must be made to estimate the timing of plant decommissioning. First, the date of the plant's retirement must be estimated. At Browns Ferry and Sequoyah, the estimated retirement date is based on the unit with the longest license period remaining. At Watts Bar, the estimated retirement date is based on each unit's license period. Second, an assumption must be made on the timing of the decommissioning. TVA has ascribed probabilities to two different decommissioning methods related to its nuclear decommissioning obligation estimate: the DECON method and the SAFSTOR method. The DECON method requires that radioactive contamination be removed from a site and safely disposed of or decontaminated to a level that permits the site to be released for unrestricted use shortly after it ceases operation. The SAFSTOR method allows nuclear facilities to be placed and maintained in a condition that allows the 
 facilities to be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated to levels that permit release for unrestricted use. TVA bases its nuclear decommissioning estimates on site-specific cost studies, which are updated for each of TVA's nuclear units at least every five years. Changes in probabilities ascribed to the assumptions or the timing of decommissioning can significantly change the present value of TVA's obligations. 
 
 Cost Estimates There is limited experience with actual decommissioning of large nuclear facilities. Changes in technology and experience as well as changes in regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning could cause cost estimates to change significantly. TVA's cost studies assume current technology and regulations. 
 
 Cost Escalation Rate TVA uses expected inflation rates over the remaining timeframe until the costs are expected to be incurred to estimate the amount of future cash flows required to satisfy TVA's decommissioning obligations. 
 
 Discount Rate TVA uses its incremental borrowing rate over a period consistent with the remaining timeframe until the costs are expected to be incurred to calculate the present value of the weighted estimated cash flows required to satisfy TVA's decommissioning obligations. 
 
 The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the derived estimates because of changes in current assumptions, such as the assumed dates of decommissioning, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in technology, and changes in the cost of labor, materials, and equipment. A 10 percent change in TVA's forecasted costs for nuclear decommissioning activities at September 30, 2024, would have affected the liability by approximately 381 million. 
 
 Non-Nuclear Decommissioning. At September 30, 2024, the estimated future non-nuclear decommissioning cost recognized in the financial statements was 7.0 billion and was included in AROs, and the unamortized regulatory asset related to non-nuclear decommissioning ARO costs of 6.2 billion was included in Regulatory assets. 
 
 This decommissioning cost estimate involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of the timing and duration of the asset retirement process and predicting how costs will escalate with inflation. These costs are predominantly CCR closure, CCR post-closure care and 
 84

 monitoring, and plant powerhouse asbestos removal. CCR closure estimates are primarily closure-in-place except for specific ponds located at Allen and Gallatin, which are closure-by-removal. CCR post-closure care and monitoring primarily includes costs for grounds maintenance, cover system and mechanical maintenance, inspections, and groundwater monitoring costs. Asbestos removal is based on cost per square foot to remove and dispose of asbestos-containing materials. TVA revises estimates of CCR closure on a project by project basis when updated cost information becomes available that causes management's expectation of cost to change materially. 
 
 The following key assumptions can have a significant effect on estimates related to the non-nuclear decommissioning costs: 
 
 Timing and Method In projecting non-nuclear decommissioning costs, the date of the asset's retirement must be estimated. In instances where the retirement of a specific asset will precede the retirement of the generating plant, the anticipated retirement date of the specific asset is used. Additionally, TVA expects to incur certain ongoing costs subsequent to the initial asset retirement. TVA develops its cost estimates based on likelihood of decommissioning method where options exist in fulfilling legal obligations (e.g., closure-in-place or closure-by-removal for coal ash impoundments). The decommissioning method is determined based on several factors including available technologies, environmental studies, cost factors, resource availability, and timing requirements. As these factors are considered and decommissioning methods are determined, the detailed project schedules and estimates are adjusted. Non-nuclear decommissioning cost estimates, including CCR post-closure care and monitoring costs and asbestos removal, are studied for revision at least every five years, but revised more frequently if updated cost information becomes available that causes management's expectation of cost to change materially. See Note 10 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Non-Nuclear Decommissioning Costs . 
 
 Technology and Regulation Changes in technology and experience as well as changes in regulations regarding non-nuclear decommissioning could cause cost estimates to change significantly. TVA's cost estimates generally assume current technology and regulations. In April 2015, EPA published its final rule governing CCR, which regulates landfill and impoundment location, design, and operations; dictates certain pond-closure conditions; and establishes groundwater monitoring and closure and post-closure standards. On May 8, 2024, EPA published its Legacy CCR Rule, which expands the scope of the existing regulatory requirements of the 2015 CCR Rule to include two additional classes of units: Legacy SIs and CCRMUs. As a result of the enactment of the final rule, during 2024, TVA recorded additional estimated AROs of 3.1 billion and recorded a corresponding regulatory asset of 3.1 billion due to these AROs being associated with closed sites and asset retirement costs having been fully depreciated. TVA continues to evaluate the impact of the rule on its operations, including cost and timing estimates of related projects. As a result, further adjustments to its ARO liabilities may be required as estimates are refined. 
 
 Cost Escalation Rate TVA uses expected inflation rates over the remaining timeframe until the costs are expected to be incurred to estimate the amount of future cash flows required to satisfy TVA's decommissioning obligations. 
 
 Discount Rate TVA uses its incremental borrowing rate over a period consistent with the remaining timeframe until the costs are expected to be incurred to calculate the present value of the weighted estimated cash flows required to satisfy TVA's decommissioning obligations. 
 
 The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the derived estimates because of changes in current assumptions, such as the assumed dates of decommissioning, changes in the discount or escalation rates, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in technology, and changes in the cost of labor, materials, and equipment. A 10 percent change in TVA's forecasted costs for non-nuclear decommissioning activities at September 30, 2024, would have affected the liability by approximately 699 million. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 Investments. Investment funds are comprised of equity securities and debt securities and are classified as trading. These securities are held in the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust ("NDT"), Asset Retirement Trust ("ART"), Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"), Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP"), Restoration Plan ("RP"), and qualified benefit pension plan. 
 
 Investment Funds . The assets in the NDT, ART, SERP, DCP, and RP are generally measured at fair value based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. These investments are primarily U.S. and international equities, real estate investment trusts, fixed income investments, high-yield fixed income investments, U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities ("TIPS"), treasuries, currencies, derivative instruments, and other investments. TVA has classified all of these trading securities as either Level 1, Level 2, or Investments measured at net asset value ("NAV"). Private equity limited partnerships, private real asset investments, and private credit investments may include holdings of investments in private real estate, venture capital, buyout, mezzanine or subordinated debt, restructuring or distressed debt, and special situations through funds managed by third-party investment managers. These investments are valued at NAV as a practical expedient for fair value. There are no readily available quoted exchange prices for these investments. The fair value of these investments is based on information provided by the investment managers. These investments are valued on a quarterly basis. See Note 16 Fair Value Measurements Valuation Techniques for a discussion of valuation levels of the investments.

 Plan Investments . TVA's qualified benefit pension plan is funded with qualified plan assets. These investments are primarily global public equities, private equities, fixed income securities, public real assets, and private real assets. See Note 20 Benefit Plans Fair Value Measurements for disclosure of fair value measurements for investments held by the TVA Retirement System ("TVARS") that support TVA's qualified defined benefit pension plan. 
 
 Pricing . Prices provided by third parties for the assets in investment funds and plan investments are subjected to automated tolerance checks by the investment portfolio trustee to identify and avoid, where possible, the use of inaccurate prices. Any such prices identified as outside the tolerance thresholds are reported to the vendor that provided the price. If the prices are validated, the primary pricing source is used. If not, a secondary source price that has passed the applicable tolerance check is used (or queried with the vendor if it is out of tolerance), resulting in either the use of a secondary price, where validated, or the last reported default price, as in the case of a missing price. For monthly valued accounts, where secondary price sources are available, an automated inter-source tolerance report identifies prices with an inter-vendor pricing variance of over two percent at an asset class level. For daily valued accounts, each security is assigned, where possible, an indicative major market index, against which daily price movements are automatically compared. Tolerance thresholds are established by asset class. Prices found to be outside of the applicable tolerance threshold are reported and queried with vendors as described above. 
 
 For investment funds, TVA additionally performs its own analytical testing on the change in fair value measurements each period to ensure the valuations are reasonable based on changes in general market assumptions. TVA also performs pricing tests on various portfolios comprised of securities classified in Levels 1 and 2 on a quarterly basis to confirm accuracy of the values received from the investment portfolio trustee. For plan investments, TVARS reviews the trustee's Service Organization Controls report and the pricing policies of the trustee's largest pricing vendor. 
 
 Derivatives. TVA has historically entered into various derivative transactions, including commodity option contracts, forward contracts, swaps, swaptions, futures, and options on futures, to manage various market risks. Other than certain derivative instruments included in investment funds, it is TVA's policy to enter into these derivative transactions solely for hedging purposes and not for speculative purposes. See Note 10 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and Note 15 Risk Management Activities and Derivative Transactions for explanations of changes in estimates. 
 
 Currency and Interest Rate Derivatives . TVA has two currency swaps and two "fixed for floating" interest rate swaps. The currency swaps protect against changes in cash flows caused by volatility in exchange rates related to outstanding Bonds denominated in British pounds sterling. TVA uses interest rate swaps to fix variable short-term debt to a fixed rate. The currency and interest rate swaps are classified as Level 2 valuations as the rate curves and interest rates affecting the fair value of the contracts are based on observable data. 
 
 Commodity Derivatives . TVA enters into commodity contracts for natural gas that require physical delivery of the contracted quantity of the commodity. The natural gas derivative contracts are classified as Level 2 valuations based on market approaches which utilize short-term and mid-term market-quoted prices from an external industry brokerage firm. 
 
 TVA maintains policies and procedures to value commodity contracts using what is believed to be the best and most relevant data available. In addition, TVA's risk management group reviews valuations and pricing data. 
 
 Commodity Derivatives under the Financial Hedging Program ("FHP") . In 2022, the FHP was reinstated and hedging activity began. The TVA Board also approved the elimination of the Value at Risk aggregate transaction limit for the FHP and authorized the use of tolerances and measures that will be reviewed annually by the TVA Board. The commodity derivatives under the FHP are classified as Level 2 valuations based on market approaches which utilize short-term and mid-term market-quoted prices from an external industry brokerage firm. 
 
 Fair Value Considerations. In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, TVA considers the source of observable market data inputs, liquidity of the instrument, credit risk, and risk of nonperformance of itself or the counterparty to the contract. The conditions and criteria used to assess these factors are described below. 
 
 Sources of Market Assumptions. TVA derives its financial instrument market assumptions from market data sources (e.g., Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's")). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, TVA uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions and determine a financial instrument's fair value. 
 
 Market Liquidity . Market liquidity is assessed by TVA based on criteria as to whether the financial instrument trades in an active or inactive market. A financial instrument is considered to be in an active market if the prices are fully transparent to the market participants, the prices can be measured by market bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively high trading volume, and the market has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of the assets traded without significantly affecting the market price. Other factors TVA considers when determining whether a market is active or inactive include the presence of government or regulatory control over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-based price upon entering into a transaction.

Table of Contents 

 Nonperformance Risk . In determining the potential impact of nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk, TVA considers changes in current market conditions, readily available information on nonperformance risk, letters of credit, collateral, other arrangements available, and the nature of master netting arrangements. TVA is a counterparty to derivative instruments that subject TVA to nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk on the majority of investments and certain exchange-traded instruments held by TVA is incorporated into the exit price that is derived from quoted market data that is used to value the investment. 
 
 Nonperformance risk for most of TVA's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value. TVA adjusts for nonperformance risk, both of TVA (for liabilities) and the counterparty (for assets), by applying a credit valuation 
 adjustment ("CVA"). TVA determines an appropriate CVA for each applicable financial instrument based on the term of the instrument and TVA's or the counterparty's credit rating as obtained from Moody's. For companies that do not have an observable credit rating, TVA uses internal analysis to assign a comparable rating to the company. TVA discounts each financial instrument using the historical default rate (as reported by Moody's for CY 1983 to CY 2023) for companies with a similar credit rating over a time period consistent with the remaining term of the contract. 
 
 All derivative instruments are analyzed individually and are subject to unique risk exposures. The application of CVAs resulted in a less than 1 million decrease in the fair value of assets and a 1 million decrease in the fair value of liabilities at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Collateral. TVA's interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and commodity derivatives under the FHP contain contract provisions that require a party to post collateral (in a form such as cash or a letter of credit) when the party's liability balance under the agreement exceeds a certain threshold. See Note 15 Risk Management Activities and Derivative Transactions Other Derivative Instruments Collateral for a discussion of collateral related to TVA's derivative liabilities. 
 
 Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits 
 
 TVA sponsors a defined benefit pension plan that is qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and covers substantially all of its full-time annual employees hired prior to July 1, 2014. TVARS, a separate legal entity governed by its own board of directors (the "TVARS Board"), administers the qualified defined benefit pension plan. TVA also provides a SERP to certain executives in critical positions, which provides supplemental pension benefits tied to compensation levels that exceed limits imposed by IRS rules applicable to the qualified defined benefit pension plan. Additionally, TVA provides post-retirement health care benefits for most of its full-time employees who reach retirement age while still working for TVA. 
 
 TVA's pension and other post-retirement benefits contain uncertainties because they require management to make certain assumptions related to TVA's cost to provide these benefits. Numerous factors are considered including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. 
 
 Certain key actuarial assumptions critical to the pension and postretirement accounting estimates include expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected health care cost trend rates, cost of living adjustments ("COLA"), and mortality rates. Every five years, a formal actuarial experience study that compares assumptions to the actual experience is conducted. Additional ad-hoc experience studies are performed as needed to review recent experience and validate recommended changes to the actuarial assumptions used based upon TVA's last experience study in 2023. See Note 20 Benefit Plans for explanations of changes in assumptions and estimates. 
 
 Expected Return on Plan Assets . The qualified defined benefit pension plan is the only plan that is funded with qualified plan assets. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, TVA uses a process that incorporates actual historical asset class returns and an assessment of expected future performance and takes into consideration external actuarial advice, the current outlook on capital markets, the asset allocation policy, and the anticipated impact of active management. In September 2023, the TVARS Board approved a new asset allocation policy, but had no changes in 2024 or 2023 to the 6.50 percent expected return on assets assumption adopted in 2022. 
 
 TVA recognizes the impact of asset performance on pension expense over a three-year phase-in period through a market-related value of assets ("MRVA") calculation. The MRVA recognizes investment gains and losses over a three-year period and is used in calculating the expected return on assets and the recognized net actuarial loss components of pension net periodic benefit cost. 
 
 A higher expected rate of return assumption decreases the net periodic pension benefit costs, whereas a lower expected rate of return assumption increases the net periodic pension benefit cost. The plan's actual rate of return for 2024 was 12.72 percent compared to the assumption of 6.50 percent. The difference between the expected and actual return on plan assets resulted in an actuarial gain of 510 million that is recognized as a decrease in the related regulatory asset and a decrease in the pension benefit obligation at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Discount Rate. TVA's discount rates are derived by identifying a theoretical settlement portfolio of high quality corporate bonds of Aa quality or higher sufficient to provide for the projected benefit payments. The model matches the present value of the projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio with any resulting excess funds 
 87 

Table of Contents 

 presumed to be reinvested and used to meet successive year benefit payments. A single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio. The resulting discount rates are reflective of both the current interest rate and the distinct liability of the pension and post-retirement benefit plans. 
 
 The discount rate is somewhat volatile because it is determined based upon the prevailing rate of long-term corporate bonds as of the measurement date. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and correspondingly decreases the net periodic pension and net post-retirement benefit costs for those plans where actuarial losses are being amortized. Alternatively, a lower discount rate increases net periodic pension and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs. The discount rates used to determine the pension and post-retirement benefit obligations were 4.95 percent and 5.00 percent, respectively, at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Health Care Cost Trends. In establishing health care cost trend rates for the post-retirement obligation, TVA reviews actual recent cost trends and projected future trends considering health care inflation, changes in health care utilization, and changes in plan benefits and premium experience. The pre-Medicare eligible per capita claims costs and per capita contributions trend rates are both 7.25 percent, declining 0.25 percent per year until it reaches the ultimate trend rate of 5.00 percent in 2034. The post-Medicare current health care cost trend rate is zero percent for years 2023 through 2025, reaching the ultimate rate of 4.00 percent in 2026. TVA recognized a 30 million actuarial gain as a result of updating the pre-Medicare health care cost trend rates to reflect observed and anticipated plan experience that is recognized as an increase in the related regulatory liability and a decrease in the post-retirement obligation at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cost of Living Adjustments. Cost of living adjustments ("COLAs") are an increase in the benefits for eligible retirees to help maintain the purchasing power of benefits as consumer prices increase. This assumption is based on the long-term expected future rate of inflation, which is based on the capital market outlooks, economic forecasts, and the Federal Reserve policy. See Note 20 Benefit Plans Plan Assumptions Cost of Living Adjustment for further discussion on the calculation of the COLA. The actual COLA for CY 2024 was 4.44 percent. The CY 2025 COLA is assumed to be 2.79 percent, and for years thereafter the COLA is assumed to be 2.00 percent. A higher COLA increases the pension benefit obligation whereas a lower COLA assumption decreases the obligation. The actual calendar year COLA and the long-term COLA assumption are used to determine the benefit obligation at September 30 and the net periodic benefit costs for the following fiscal year. 
 
 Mortality . TVA's mortality assumptions are based upon actuarial projections in combination with actuarial studies of the actual mortality experience of TVARS's pension and post-retirement benefit plan participants taking into consideration the Society of Actuaries ("SOA") mortality table and projection scales as of September 30, 2024. TVA continues to monitor the availability of updates to mortality tables, longevity improvement scales, and mortality reviews and experience studies to consider whether these updates should be reflected in the current year mortality assumption. 
 
 The following tables illustrate the estimated effects of changing certain of the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant and excluding any impact for unamortized actuarial gains and losses:

 TVA does not engage, and does not control any entity that is engaged, in any activity listed under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), which requires certain issuers to disclose certain activities relating to Iran involving the issuer and its affiliates. Based on information supplied by each such person, none of TVA's directors and executive officers are involved in any such activities. While TVA is an agency and instrumentality of the U.S., TVA does not believe its disclosure obligations, if any, under Section 13(r) extend to the activities of any other departments, divisions, or agencies of the U.S. 

Environmental Matters

Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, TVA is party to or otherwise involved in lawsuits, claims, proceedings, investigations, and other legal matters ("Legal Proceedings") that have arisen in the ordinary course of conducting its activities. As of September 30, 2024, TVA had accrued approximately 10 million with respect to Legal Proceedings. No assurance can be given that TVA will not be subject to significant additional claims and liabilities. If actual liabilities significantly exceed the estimates made, TVA's results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Risk Management Activities 
 
 TVA is exposed to various market risks. These market risks include risks related to commodity prices, investment prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, inflation, and counterparty credit and performance risk. To help manage certain of these risks, TVA has entered into various derivative transactions, including commodity option contracts, forward contracts, swaps, swaptions, futures, and options on futures. Other than certain derivative instruments in its trust investment funds, it is TVA's policy to enter into these derivative transactions solely for hedging purposes and not for speculative purposes. See Note 15 Risk Management Activities and Derivative Transactions . 
 
 Risk Governance 
 
 The Enterprise Risk Council ("ERC") is responsible for the highest level of risk oversight at TVA and is also responsible for communicating enterprise-wide risks with policy implications to the TVA Board or a designated TVA Board committee. The ERC is comprised of the Senior Management Council and the Chief Risk Officer ("CRO") who acts as Chair. ERC members may invite additional attendees to meetings as non-voting participants. The ERC has also established subordinate committees, consisting of business unit leaders, to assist in the oversight of fuel and power procurement, DER programs and products, security, artificial intelligence, privacy, and technology risks, and general risk management. 
 
 TVA has a designated Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") organization within its Financial Services organization responsible for (1) establishing enterprise risk management policies and guidelines, (2) developing an enterprise risk profile aligned with TVA's strategic objectives, (3) performing annual risk assessments across all TVA business units, (4) monitoring and reporting on identified enterprise risks and emerging risks, (5) facilitating enterprise risk discussions with the risk subject matter experts across the organization and at the ERC and TVA Board levels, and (6) developing and improving TVA's risk awareness culture. TVA has cataloged major short-term and long-term enterprise level risks across the organization. A discussion of significant risks is presented in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 TVA is exposed to effects of market fluctuations in the price of commodities that are critical to its operations, including 
 89 

Table of Contents 

 electricity, coal, and natural gas. The magnitude of exposure to these risks is influenced by many factors including contract terms and market liquidity. TVA's commodity price risk is substantially mitigated by its cost-based rates, including its total fuel cost adjustment, and long-term fixed price commodity contracts. 
 
 Commodity Derivatives. TVA manages risk with commodity contracts for natural gas that require physical delivery of the contracted quantity. An immediate 10 percent decline in the market price of natural gas on September 30, 2024 and 2023, would have resulted in decreases of less than 1 million and 1 million, respectively, in the fair value of TVA's natural gas derivative instruments at these dates. 
 
 Commodity Derivatives under the FHP. TVA manages risk with commodity derivatives under the FHP by hedging exposure to the price of natural gas. An immediate 10 percent decline in the market price of natural gas on September 30, 2024 and 2023, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 72 million and 127 million, respectively, in the fair value of TVA's natural gas derivative instruments under the FHP. 
 
 Investment Price Risk 
 
 TVA's investment price risk relates primarily to investments in TVA's NDT, ART, pension fund, SERP, DCP, and RP. 
 
 Nuclear Decommissioning Trust. The NDT is generally designed to achieve a return in line with overall equity and debt market performance. The assets of the trust are invested in debt and equity securities, private partnerships, and certain derivative instruments including forwards, futures, options, and swaps, and through these investments the trust has exposure to U.S. equities, international equities, real estate investment trusts, natural resource equities, high-yield debt, domestic debt, U.S. TIPS, treasuries, private real assets, private equity, and private credit strategies. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, an immediate 10 percent decrease in the price of the investments in the trust would have reduced the value of the trust by 333 million and 279 million, respectively. 
 
 Asset Retirement Trust. The ART is presently invested to achieve a return in line with overall equity and debt market performance. The assets of the trust are invested in debt and equity securities, private partnerships, and certain derivative instruments including options, and through these investments the trust has exposure to U.S. equities, real estate investment trusts, natural resource equities, high-yield debt, domestic debt, TIPS, treasuries, private real assets, private equity, and private credit strategies. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, an immediate 10 percent decrease in the price of the investments in the trust would have reduced the value of the trust by 152 million and 124 million, respectively. 
 
 Qualified Pension Plan . In 2021, a new asset allocation policy was put in place to reduce risk and volatility in the TVARS investment portfolio. Furthermore, in September 2023, based on current market conditions and updated capital market assumptions, the asset allocation policy was modified to further progress towards these goals. TVARS investments will be reallocated in a prudent manner over time to move toward the new asset allocation targets. The TVARS asset allocation policy for qualified pension plan assets has targets of 17 percent growth assets, 30 percent defensive growth assets, 33 percent defensive assets, and 20 percent inflation-sensitive assets. Pursuant to the TVARS Rules and Regulations, any proposed changes in asset allocation that would change TVARS's assumed rate of investment return are subject to the review and veto of the TVA Board. 
 
 As set forth above, the qualified pension plan assets are invested across growth assets, defensive growth assets, defensive assets, and inflation-sensitive assets. The TVARS asset allocation policy includes permissible deviations from target allocations, and action can be taken, as appropriate, to rebalance the plan's assets consistent with the asset allocation policy. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, an immediate 10 percent decrease in the value of the net assets of the fund would have reduced the value of the fund by approximately 867 million and 813 million, respectively. 
 
 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan . The SERP is a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan similar to those typically found in other companies in TVA's peer group and is provided to selected employees of TVA. TVA's SERP was created to recruit and retain key executives. The plan is designed to provide a competitive level of retirement benefits in excess of the limitations on contributions and benefits imposed by TVA's qualified defined benefit plan and Internal Revenue Code Section 415 limits on qualified retirement plans. The SERP currently targets an asset allocation policy for its plan assets of 64 percent equity securities, which includes U.S. and non-U.S. equities, and 36 percent fixed income securities. The SERP plan assets are presently invested to achieve a return in line with overall equity and debt market performance. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, an immediate 10 percent decrease in the value of the SERP investments would have reduced the value of the investments by 10 million and 8 million, respectively. 
 
 Deferred Compensation Plan. The DCP is designed to provide participants with the ability to defer compensation to future periods. The plan assists in the recruitment of top executive talent for TVA. As in other corporations, deferred compensation can be an integral part of a total compensation package. Assets currently include deferral balances. The default return on investment of the accounts is interest calculated based on the composite rate of all marketable U.S. Treasury issues. Executives may alternatively choose to have their balances adjusted based on the return of certain mutual funds. At both September 30, 2024 and 2023, an immediate 10 percent decrease in the value of the deferred compensation accounts would have reduced the value of the accounts by 2 million. 
 90 

Table of Contents 

 Restoration Plan . The RP is a non-qualified excess 401(k) plan designed to allow certain eligible employees whose contributions to the 401(k) plan are limited by IRS rules to save additional amounts for retirement and receive non-elective and matching employer contributions. The plan is designed to provide a competitive level of retirement benefits and assist in the recruitment of executive talent for TVA. The default return on investment of the accounts is interest calculated based on the composite rate of all marketable U.S. Treasury issues. Executives may alternatively choose to have their balances adjusted based on the return of certain mutual funds. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, an immediate 10 percent decrease in the value of the RP accounts would have reduced the value of the accounts by less than 1 million. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 TVA's interest rate risk is related primarily to its short-term investments, short-term debt, long-term debt, and interest rate derivatives. 
 
 Investments. At September 30, 2024, TVA had 502 million of cash and cash equivalents, and the average balance of cash and cash equivalents for 2024 was 600 million. The average interest rate that TVA received on its short-term investments during 2024 was 5.39 percent. If the rates of interest that TVA received on its short-term investments during 2024 were 4.39 percent, TVA would have received 6 million less in interest from its short-term investments. At September 30, 2023, TVA had 501 million of cash and cash equivalents, and the average balance of cash and cash equivalents for 2023 was 544 million. The average interest rate that TVA received on its short-term investments during 2023 was 4.65 percent. If the rates that TVA received on its short-term investments during 2023 were 3.65 percent, TVA would have received approximately 5 million less in interest from its short-term investments. In addition to affecting the amount of interest that TVA receives from its short-term investments, changes in interest rates could affect the value of the investments in its NDT, ART, pension plan, SERP, DCP, and RP. See Risk Management Activities Investment Price Risk above. 
 
 Short-Term Debt . At September 30, 2024, TVA's short-term borrowings were 1.2 billion, and the current maturities of power bonds and debt of variable interest entities were 1.1 billion. Based on TVA's interest rate exposure at September 30, 2024, an immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of 22 million in TVA's short-term interest expense. At September 30, 2023, TVA's short-term borrowings were 432 million, and the current maturities of long-term debt were 1.1 billion. Based on TVA's interest rate exposure at September 30, 2023, an immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of 15 million in TVA's short-term interest expense. 
 
 Long-Term Debt. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the interest rates on all of TVA's outstanding long-term debt were fixed (or subject only to downward adjustment under certain conditions). Accordingly, an immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates would not have affected TVA's interest expense associated with its long-term debt. When TVA's long-term debt matures or is redeemed, however, TVA typically refinances debt in whole or in part by issuing additional debt. Accordingly, if interest rates are high when TVA issues this additional debt, TVA's cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. This risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that TVA's debt portfolio is diversified in terms of maturities and has a long average life. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average life of TVA's debt portfolio was 13.96 years and 14.43 years, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average interest rate of TVA's debt portfolio was 4.69 percent and 4.61 percent, respectively. See Note 14 Debt and Other Obligations Debt Outstanding for a schedule of TVA's debt maturities. 
 
 Interest Rate Derivatives. Changes in interest rates also affect the mark-to-market ("MtM") valuation of TVA's interest rate derivatives. See Note 15 Risk Management Activities and Derivative Transactions Derivatives Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment Interest Rate Derivatives . TVA had two interest rate swaps outstanding at both September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net unrealized gains and losses on the swaps are reflected on TVA's Consolidated Balance Sheets in a regulatory liability or asset account, and realized gains and losses are reflected in earnings. Based on TVA's interest rate exposure at September 30, 2024, an immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have increased the interest rate swap liabilities by 293 million. Based on TVA's interest rate exposure at September 30, 2023, an immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have increased the interest rate swap liabilities by 272 million. 
 
 Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 Over the next several years, TVA plans to spend a significant amount of capital on clean air projects, capacity expansion, and other projects. A portion of this amount may be spent on contracts that are denominated in one or more foreign currencies. Additionally, TVA's two issues of Bonds denominated in British pounds sterling are hedged by currency swap agreements. If not effectively managed, foreign currency exposure could negatively impact TVA's counterparty risk, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition.

 TVA also manages the Tennessee River, its tributaries, and certain shorelines to provide, among other things, year-round navigation, flood damage reduction, and affordable and reliable electricity. Consistent with these primary purposes, TVA also manages the river system and public lands to provide recreational opportunities, adequate water supply, improved water quality, cultural and natural resource protection, and economic development. TVA performs these management duties in cooperation with other federal and state agencies that have jurisdiction and authority over certain aspects of the river system. In addition, the TVA Board of Directors ("TVA Board") has established two councils the Regional Resource Stewardship Council and the Regional Energy Resource Council to advise TVA on its stewardship activities in the Tennessee Valley and its energy resource activities. 
 
 The power program has historically been separate and distinct from the stewardship programs. It is required to be self-supporting from power revenues and proceeds from power financings, such as proceeds from the issuance of bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness (collectively, "Bonds"). Although TVA does not currently receive Congressional appropriations, it is required to make annual payments to the United States Department of the Treasury ("U.S. Treasury") as a return on the government's appropriation investment in TVA's power facilities (the "Power Program Appropriation Investment"). In the 1998 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, Congress directed TVA to fund essential stewardship activities related to its 
 99 

Table of Contents 

 billion of the Power Program Appropriation Investment with the 2014 payment; therefore, this repayment obligation is no longer a component of rate setting. In setting TVA's rates, the TVA Board is charged by the TVA Act to have due regard for the primary objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective that power shall be sold at rates as low as are feasible. Rates set by the TVA Board are not subject to review or approval by any state or other federal regulatory body.

 . 
 
 Nuclear Fuel. Nuclear fuel, which is included in Property, plant, and equipment, is valued using the average cost method for raw materials and the specific identification method for nuclear fuel in a reactor. Amortization of nuclear fuel in a reactor is calculated on a units-of-production basis and is included in fuel expense. 
 
 TVA, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE"), and certain nuclear fuel contractors have entered into agreements, referred to as the Down-blend Offering for Tritium ("DBOT"), that provide for the production, processing, and storage of low-enriched uranium that is to be made using surplus DOE highly enriched uranium and other uranium. Low-enriched uranium can b e fabricated into fuel for use in a nuclear power plant. Production of the low-enriched uranium began in 2019 and is contracted to continue through September 2027. Contract activity after that date will consist of storage and flag management. Flag management ensures that the uranium is unencumbered by policy restrictions, so that it can be used in connection with the production of tritium. Under the terms of the interagency agreement between the DOE and TVA, the DOE will reimburse TVA for a portion of the costs of converting the highly enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium. Since 2019, TVA has received million in reimbursements from the DOE, which is recorded as a reduction in nuclear fuel inventory costs. At September 30, 2024, TVA recorded million in Accounts receivable, net related to this agreement. 
 
 Depreciation. TVA accounts for depreciation of its properties using the composite depreciation convention of accounting. Under the composite method, assets with similar economic characteristics are grouped and depreciated as one asset. Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the various classes of assets. The estimation of asset useful lives requires management judgment, supported by external depreciation studies of historical asset retirement experience. Depreciation rates are determined based on external depreciation studies that are updated approximately every five years, with the latest study implemented in 2022.

 Hydroelectric Gas and oil-fired Transmission Other 
 Note 
 (1) The rates include the acceleration of depreciation related to retiring certain coal-fired units and potentially retiring the remainder of the coal-fired fleet by 2035. See Note 7 Plant Closures . 
 
 Reacquired Rights . TVA previously entered into leasing transactions to obtain third-party financing for 24 peaking CTs as well as certain qualified technological equipment and software QTE ). All of the lease proceeds were accounted for as financing obligations due to TVA s continuing involvement with the combustion turbine facilities and the QTE during the leaseback term. These financial obligations were paid off, and TVA acquired the residual leasehold interests for all of this equipment and recorded the cash consideration as reacquired rights, which is an intangible asset included in property, plant, and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, property, plant, and equipment includes intangible reacquired rights, net of amortization, of million and million, respectively. Reacquired rights are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the underlying CTs which range from 30 to 35 years. Amortization expense was million, million, and million for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and accumulated amortization at September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled million and million, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five years and thereafter is shown below:

The total lease obligations included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, Other long-term liabilities, and Finance lease liabilities related to these agreements were million and million for finance and operating leases, respectively, at September 30, 2023. 
 
 TVA has agreements with lease and non-lease components and has elected to separate lease and non-lease components. Consideration is allocated to lease and non-lease components generally based on relative standalone price basis. Variable lease costs included in the agreements are allocated based on the determination of lease and non-lease components. 
 
 TVA has lease agreements which include options for renewal and early termination. The intent to renew a lease varies depending on the lease type and asset. Renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised are included in the lease measurements. The decision to terminate a lease early is dependent on various economic factors. No termination options have been included in TVA's lease measurements. 
 
 Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, which do not include an option to extend the initial term of the lease to greater than 12 months that TVA is reasonably certain to exercise, are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. Rent expense associated with short-term leases and variable leases is recorded in Operating and maintenance expense, Fuel expense, or Purchased power expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Expenses associated with finance leases result in the separate presentation of interest expense on the lease liability and amortization expense of the related lease asset on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

TVA's decision to retire the two units at Cumberland is estimated to result in approximately million of additional depreciation quarterly, which does not include any potential impact from additions or retirements to net completed plant. The cumulative impact approximates million of additional depreciation since January 2023, related to this decision. In addition, TVA's decision to retire the nine units at Kingston is estimated to result in approximately million of additional depreciation quarterly, which does not include any potential impact from additions or retirements to net completed plant.

 Retirement Benefit Plans Deferred Costs (Credits) . TVA measures the funded status of its pension and post-retirement ("OPEB") benefit plans at each year-end balance sheet date. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations at the measurement date for each plan. The changes in funded status are actuarial gains and losses that are recognized on TVA's Consolidated Balance Sheets by adjusting the recognized pension and OPEB liabilities, with the offset deferred as a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability. In an unregulated environment, these deferred costs (credits) would be recognized as an increase or decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"). 
 
 "Incurred cost" is a cost arising from cash paid out or an obligation to pay for an acquired asset or service, and a loss from any cause that has been sustained and for which payment has been or must be made. In the cases of pension and OPEB costs, the unfunded obligation represents a projected liability to the employee for services rendered, and thus it meets the definition of an incurred cost. Therefore, amounts that otherwise would be charged to AOCI for these costs are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability since TVA has historically recovered pension and OPEB expense in rates. Through historical and

 billion as a result of the Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA's") final legacy coal combustion residual ("CCR") rule ("Legacy CCR Rule") and recorded a corresponding regulatory asset of billion due to these AROs being associated with closed sites and asset retirement costs having been fully depreciated. See Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligations. 
 
 Environmental Compliance and Remediation Costs. TVA uses regulatory accounting for certain amounts associated with compliance with an order, regulation, settlement, or lawsuit, or certain costs associated with environmental remediation activities, including but not limited to those involving environmental cleanup activities and groundwater activities. Costs will be recovered in rates based on the average life of debt financed to fund actual expenditures. See Note 22 Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Contingencies Environmental Matters. 
 
 Unrealized Losses on Interest Rate Derivatives . TVA uses regulatory accounting treatment to defer the unrealized gains and losses on certain interest rate derivative contracts. When amounts in these contracts are realized, the resulting gains or losses are included in the ratemaking formula. The unrealized losses on these interest rate derivatives are recorded on TVA's Consolidated Balance Sheets as current and non-current regulatory assets, and the related realized gains or losses, if any, are recorded on TVA's Consolidated Statements of Operations when the contracts settle. A portion of certain unrealized gains and losses will be amortized into earnings over the remaining lives of the contracts. Gains and losses on interest rate derivatives that are expected to be realized within the next year are included as a current regulatory asset or liability on TVA's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 TVA does not recognize unrealized gains and losses from the investment portfolios and derivative instruments within earnings but rather defers all such gains and losses within a regulatory liability or asset in accordance with its accounting policy. See Note 15 Risk Management Activities and Derivative Transactions and Note 16 Fair Value Measurements. 
 
 Nuclear Decommissioning Costs. Nuclear decommissioning costs include (1) certain deferred charges related to the future closure and decommissioning of TVA's nuclear generating units under the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") requirements, (2) recognition of changes in the liability, (3) recognition of changes in the value of TVA's NDT, and (4) certain other deferred charges under the accounting rules for AROs. These future costs can be funded through a combination of investment funds set aside in the NDT and ART and future earnings on those investment funds. Deferred charges will be recovered in rates based on the analysis of expected expenditures, contributions, and investment earnings required to recover the decommissioning costs. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Investment Funds. Recovery of future decommissioning costs is dependent upon the future earnings of the NDT and ART, timing of decommissioning activities, and changes in decommissioning estimates. The regulatory asset is classified as long-term as amounts recovered are

John Sevier VIEs 
 
 In 2012, TVA entered into a billion construction management agreement and lease financing arrangement with John Sevier Combined Cycle Generation LLC ("JSCCG") for the completion and lease by TVA of the John Sevier Combined Cycle Facility ("John Sevier CCF"). JSCCG is a special single-purpose limited liability company formed in January 2012 to finance the John Sevier CCF through a million secured note issuance (the "JSCCG notes") and the issuance of million of membership interests subject to mandatory redemption. The membership interests were purchased by John Sevier Holdco LLC ("Holdco"). Holdco is a special single-purpose entity, also formed in January 2012, established to acquire and hold the membership interests in JSCCG. A non-controlling interest in Holdco is held by a third-party through nominal membership interests, to which none of the income, expenses, and cash flows are allocated. 
 
 The membership interests held by Holdco in JSCCG were purchased with proceeds from the issuance of million of secured notes (the "Holdco notes") and are subject to mandatory redemption pursuant to a schedule of amortizing, semi-annual payments due each January 15 and July 15, with a final payment due in January 2042. The payment dates for the mandatorily redeemable membership interests are the same as those of the Holdco notes. The sale of the JSCCG notes, the membership interests in JSCCG, and the Holdco notes closed in January 2012. The JSCCG notes are secured by TVA's lease payments, and the Holdco notes are secured by Holdco's investment in, and amounts receivable from, JSCCG. TVA's lease payments to JSCCG are equal to and payable on the same dates as JSCCG's and Holdco's semi-annual debt service payments. In addition to the lease payments, TVA pays administrative and miscellaneous expenses incurred by JSCCG and Holdco. Certain agreements related to this transaction contain default and acceleration provisions. 
 
 Due to its participation in the design, business activity, and credit and financial support of JSCCG and Holdco, TVA has determined that it has a variable interest in each of these entities. Based on its analysis, TVA has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of JSCCG and Holdco and, as such, is required to account for the VIEs on a consolidated basis. Holdco's membership interests in JSCCG are eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 Southaven VIE 
 
 In 2013, TVA entered into a million lease financing arrangement with Southaven Combined Cycle Generation LLC ("SCCG") for the lease by TVA of the Southaven Combined Cycle Facility ("Southaven CCF"). SCCG is a special single-purpose limited liability company formed in June 2013 to finance the Southaven CCF through a million secured notes issuance (the "SCCG notes") and the issuance of million of membership interests subject to mandatory redemption. The membership interests were purchased by Southaven Holdco LLC ("SHLLC"). SHLLC is a special single-purpose entity, also formed in June 2013, established to acquire and hold the membership interests in SCCG. A non-controlling interest in SHLLC is held by a third-party through nominal membership interests, to which none of the income, expenses, and cash flows of SHLLC are allocated. 
 
 The membership interests held by SHLLC were purchased with proceeds from the issuance of million of secured notes (the "SHLLC notes") and are subject to mandatory redemption pursuant to a schedule of amortizing, semi-annual payments due each February 15 and August 15, with a final payment due on August 15, 2033. The payment dates for the mandatorily redeemable membership interests are the same as those of the SHLLC notes, and the payment amounts are sufficient to provide returns on, as well as returns of, capital until the investment has been repaid to SHLLC in full. The rate of return on investment to SHLLC is percent, which is reflected as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. SHLLC is required to pay a pre-determined portion of the return on investment to Seven States Southaven, LLC ("SSSL") on each lease payment date as agreed in SHLLC's formation documents (the "Seven States Return"). The current and long-term portions of the Membership interests of VIE subject to mandatory redemption are included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities, respectively. 
 
 The payment dates for the mandatorily redeemable membership interests are the same as those of the SHLLC notes. The SCCG notes are secured by TVA's lease payments, and the SHLLC notes are secured by SHLLC's investment in, and amounts receivable from, SCCG. TVA's lease payments to SCCG are payable on the same dates as SCCG's and SHLLC's semi-annual debt service payments and are equal to the sum of (i) the amount of SCCG's semi-annual debt service payments, (ii) the amount of SHLLC's semi-annual debt service payments, and (iii) the amount of the Seven States Return. In addition to the lease payments, TVA pays administrative and miscellaneous expenses incurred by SCCG and SHLLC. Certain agreements related to this transaction contain default and acceleration provisions. 
 
 In the event that TVA were to choose to exercise an early buy out feature of the Southaven facility lease, in part or in whole, TVA must pay to SCCG amounts sufficient for SCCG to repay or partially repay on a pro rata basis the membership interests held by SHLLC, including any outstanding investment amount plus accrued but unpaid return. TVA also has the right, at any time and without any early redemption of the other portions of the Southaven facility lease payments due to SCCG, to fully repay SHLLC's investment, upon which repayment SHLLC will transfer the membership interests to a designee of TVA.

See Note 8 Leases for more information regarding leases. 
 
 Currency Swap Liabilities . To protect against exchange rate risk related to British pound sterling denominated Bond transactions, TVA entered into foreign currency hedges. The values of these derivatives are included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 15 Risk Management Activities and Derivative Transactions Overview of Accounting Treatment and Cash Flow Hedging Strategy for Currency Swaps for more information regarding the currency swap liabilities. 
 
 Commodity Contract Derivative Liabilities. TVA enters into certain derivative contracts for natural gas that require physical delivery of the contracted quantity of the commodity as well as certain financial derivative contracts to hedge exposure to the price of natural gas. See Note 15 Risk Management Activities and Derivative Transactions Derivatives Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment Commodity Derivatives and Commodity Derivatives under the FHP for a discussion of TVA's commodity contract derivatives. 
 
 EnergyRight Financing Obligation . TVA purchases certain loans receivable from its LPCs in association with the EnergyRight program. The current and long-term portions of the resulting financing obligation are reported in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities, respectively, on TVA's Consolidated Balance Sheets. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount of the financing obligation reported in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities was million and million respectively. See Note 9 Other Long-Term Assets for information regarding the associated loans receivable. 
 
 Long-Term Deferred Compensation . TVA provides compensation arrangements to engage and retain certain employees, both executive and non-executive, which are designed to provide participants with the ability to defer compensation to future periods. The current and long-term portions are recorded in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities, respectively, on TVA s Consolidated Balance Sheets. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the current amount of deferred compensation recorded in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities was million and million, respectively.

13. Asset Retirement Obligations 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2024, TVA's total ARO liability increased billion. 
 
 To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear generating stations, TVA uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimations and assumptions. Those assumptions include (1) estimates of the cost of decommissioning; (2) the method of decommissioning and the timing of the related cash flows; (3) the license period of the nuclear plant, considering the probability of license extensions; (4) cost escalation factors; and (5) the credit adjusted risk free rate to measure the obligation at the present value of the future estimated costs. TVA has ascribed probabilities to two different decommissioning methods related to its nuclear decommissioning obligation estimate: the DECON method and the SAFSTOR method. The DECON method requires radioactive contamination to be removed from a site and safely disposed of or decontaminated to a level that permits the site to be released for unrestricted use shortly after it ceases operation. The SAFSTOR method allows nuclear facilities to be placed and maintained in a condition that allows the facilities to be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated to levels that permit release for unrestricted use. 
 
 TVA also has decommissioning obligations related to its non-nuclear generating sites, ash impoundments, transmission substation and distribution assets, and certain general facilities. To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to these assets, TVA uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimations and assumptions. Those assumptions include (1) estimates of the costs of decommissioning, (2) the method of decommissioning and the timing of the related cash flows, (3) the expected retirement date of each asset, (4) cost escalation factors, and (5) the credit adjusted risk free rate to measure the obligation at the present value of the future estimated costs. TVA bases its decommissioning estimates for each asset on its identified preferred closure method. 
 
 On May 8, 2024, EPA published its Legacy CCR Rule, which expands the scope of the existing regulatory requirements of EPA's 2015 CCR rule, as revised ("2015 CCR Rule"), to include two additional classes of CCR units: legacy CCR surface impoundments ("Legacy SIs") and CCR management units ("CCRMUs"). Legacy SIs include inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities that were exempt from the 2015 CCR Rule. CCRMUs are a newly defined category that includes previously unregulated areas at CCR facilities where CCR was beneficially reused in an unencapsulated manner, disposed, placed, or managed on land outside of CCR units regulated by the 2015 CCR Rule. TVA records the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. As a result of the enactment of the final rule, during 2024, TVA recorded additional estimated AROs of billion and recorded a corresponding regulatory asset of 3.1 billion due to these AROs being associated with closed sites and asset retirement costs having been fully depreciated. Key assumptions used to determine this estimate include the preliminary identification of Legacy SIs and CCRMUs at TVA facilities

 impacted by the rule, the anticipated number of acres per newly regulated CCR unit, the expected closure method, a cost benchmark per acre based on sites currently being remediated, the potential duration of closure activities, and the escalation and discount factors. There are legal challenges to the Legacy CCR Rule that may impact the number and scope of newly regulated units and the determinations on final closure requirements and performance standards. Revisions to the additional estimated non-nuclear AROs from the Legacy CCR Rule will be made whenever factors indicate that the timing or amounts of estimated cash flows have changed. See also Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters . 
 
 Revisions in non-nuclear estimates increased the liability balance by million for the year ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to a change in closure liabilities of 231 million at Gallatin Fossil Plant based on scope changes, new vendor bids, and updated cost estimates for activities associated with final closure and 76 million at Cumberland based on scope changes to the interim closure plan and updated cost estimates for activities associated with final closure. Additionally, TVA completed a study of its CCR post-closure care obligations in September 2024, which resulted in an increase of 32 million as a result of expected cost increases. In September 2024, TVA decreased its liability for legacy CCR areas by 38 million as a result of revised acreage assumptions for areas covered by the Legacy CCR Rule. 
 
 Revisions in nuclear estimates decreased the liability balance by million for the year ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to an estimate revision of million following the filing of a subsequent license 
 renewal ("SLR") application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") for Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant ("Browns Ferry"). 
 If approved, the SLR will allow for an additional 20 years of operations for each of Browns Ferry's three units, resulting in a total 
 operating life of 80 years. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2023, the revisions in non-nuclear estimates increased the liability balance by million. During the year, CCR closure liabilities at Bull Run, Johnsonville, and Cumberland increased million due to revised cost estimates for final closure activities based on TVA's current approved closure strategies at these sites. Partially offsetting these increases, expected reductions in CCR post-closure costs for long-term monitoring at Gallatin resulted in a decrease of million. In addition, CCR closure liabilities at Cumberland decreased million due to identified changes in the projected timing of certain asset retirement activities, and CCR closure liabilities at Paradise decreased million based on refined project cost estimates. 
 
 Additionally, during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, both the nuclear and non-nuclear liabilities were increased by periodic accretion, partially offset by settlements related to retirement projects that were conducted during the respective periods. The nuclear and non-nuclear accretion amounts were deferred as regulatory assets. During 2024, 2023, and 2022, million, million, and million, respectively, of the related regulatory assets were amortized into expense as these amounts were collected in rates. See Note 10 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities . TVA maintains investment trusts to help fund its decommissioning obligations.

 billion at any time. At September 30, 2024, TVA had only two types of Bonds outstanding: power bonds and discount notes. Power bonds have maturities between one year and 50 years, and discount notes have maturities of less than one year. Power bonds and discount notes are both issued pursuant to Section 15d of the TVA Act and pursuant to the Basic Tennessee Valley Authority Power Bond Resolution adopted by the TVA Board on October 6, 1960, as amended on September 28, 1976, October 17, 1989, and March 25, 1992 (the "Basic Resolution"). Bonds are not obligations of the U.S., and the U.S. does not guarantee the payments of principal or interest on Bonds. 
 
 Power bonds and discount notes rank on parity and have first priority of payment from net power proceeds, which are defined as the remainder of TVA's gross power revenues after deducting the costs of operating, maintaining, and administering its power properties and tax equivalent payments, but before deducting depreciation accruals or other charges representing the amortization of capital expenditures, plus the net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any power facility or interest therein. 
 
 TVA considers its scheduled payments under its lease financing arrangements involving John Sevier CCF and Southaven CCF as costs of operating, maintaining, and administering its power properties. Costs of operating, maintaining, and administering TVA's power properties have priority over TVA's payments on the Bonds. Once net power proceeds have been applied to payments on power bonds and discount notes as well as any other Bonds that TVA may issue in the future that rank on parity with or subordinate to power bonds and discount notes, Section 2.3 of the Basic Resolution provides that the remaining net power proceeds shall be used only for (1) minimum payments into the U.S. Treasury required by the TVA Act as repayment of, and as a return on, the Power Program Appropriation Investment; (2) investment in power system assets; (3) additional reductions of TVA's capital obligations; and (4) other lawful purposes related to TVA's power business. 
 
 The TVA Act and the Basic Resolution each contain two bond tests: the rate test and the bondholder protection test. Under the rate test, TVA must charge rates for power which will produce gross revenues sufficient to provide funds for, among other things, debt service on outstanding Bonds. As of September 30, 2024, TVA was in compliance with the rate test. Under the bondholder protection test, TVA must, in successive five-year periods, use an amount of net power proceeds at least equal to the sum of (1) the depreciation accruals and other charges representing the amortization of capital expenditures and (2) the net proceeds from any disposition of power facilities for either the reduction of its capital obligations (including Bonds and the Power Program Appropriation Investment) or investment in power assets. TVA met the bondholder protection test for the five-year period ended September 30, 2020, and must next meet the bondholder protection test for the five-year period ending September 30, 2025 . 
 
 Secured Debt of VIEs 
 
 On August 9, 2013, SCCG issued secured notes totaling million that bear interest at a rate of percent. The SCCG notes require amortizing semi-annual payments on each February 15 and August 15, and mature on August 15, 2033. Also on August 9, 2013, SCCG issued million of membership interests subject to mandatory redemption. The proceeds from the secured notes issuance and the issuance of the membership interests were paid to TVA in accordance with the terms of the Southaven head lease. See Note 11 Variable Interest Entities Southaven VIE . TVA used the proceeds from the transaction primarily to fund the acquisition of the Southaven CCF from SSSL. 
 
 On January 17, 2012, JSCCG issued secured notes totaling million in aggregate principal amount that bear interest at a rate of percent. Also on January 17, 2012, Holdco issued secured notes totaling million that bear interest at a rate of percent. The JSCCG notes and the Holdco notes require amortizing semi-annual payments on each January 15 and July 15, and mature on January 15, 2042. The Holdco notes require a million balloon payment upon maturity. See Note 11 Variable Interest Entities John Sevier VIEs . TVA used the proceeds from the transaction to meet its requirements under the TVA Act. 
 
 Secured debt of VIEs, including current maturities, outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled million and million, respectively.

 Put Options 
 
 TVA has two issues of Putable Automatic Rate Reset Securities ("PARRS") outstanding. After a fixed-rate period of five years, the coupon rate on the PARRS may automatically be reset downward under certain market conditions on an annual basis. The coupon rate reset on the PARRS is based on a calculation. For both series of PARRS, the coupon rate will reset downward on the reset date if the rate calculated is below the then-current coupon rate on the Bond. The calculation dates, potential reset dates, and terms of the calculation are different for each series. The coupon rate on the 1998 Series D PARRS may be reset on June 1 (annually) if the sum of the five-day average of the 30-Year Constant Maturity Treasury ("CMT") rate for the week ending the last Friday in April, plus 94 basis points, is below the then-current coupon rate. The coupon rate on the 1999 Series A PARRS may be reset on May 1 (annually) if the sum of the five-day average of the 30-Year CMT rate for the week ending the last Friday in March, plus 84 basis points, is below the then-current coupon rate. The coupon rates may only be reset downward, but investors may request to redeem their Bonds at par value in conjunction with a coupon rate reset for a limited period of time prior to the reset dates under certain circumstances. 
 
 The coupon rate for the 1998 Series D PARRS, which mature in June 2028, has been reset eight times, from an initial rate of percent to the current rate of percent. In connection with these resets, million of the Bonds have been redeemed; therefore, million of the Bonds were outstanding at September 30, 2024. The coupon rate for the 1999 Series A PARRS, which mature in May 2029, has been reset seven times, from an initial rate of percent to the current rate of percent. In connection with these resets, million of the Bonds have been redeemed; therefore, million of the Bonds were outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Due to the contingent nature of the put option on the PARRS, TVA determines whether the PARRS should be classified as long-term debt or current maturities of long-term debt by calculating the expected reset rate for the Bonds on the calculation dates, described above. If the determination date for reset is before the balance sheet date of the reporting period and the expected reset rate is less than the then-current coupon rate on the PARRS, the PARRS are included in current maturities. Otherwise, the PARRS are included in long-term debt.

 Credit Facility Agreements 
 
 TVA has funding available under long-term revolving credit facilities totaling billion. See the table below for additional information on the long-term revolving credit facilities. The interest rate on any borrowing under these facilities varies based on market factors and the rating of TVA's senior unsecured, long-term, non-credit-enhanced debt. TVA is required to pay an unused facility fee on the portion of the total billion that TVA has not borrowed or committed under letters of credit. This fee, along with letter of credit fees, may fluctuate depending on the rating of TVA's senior unsecured, long-term, non-credit-enhanced debt. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were million and million, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding under these facilities, and there were borrowings outstanding. TVA's letters of credit are primarily posted as collateral under TVA's interest rate swaps. See Note 15 Risk Management Activities and Derivative Transactions Other Derivative Instruments Collateral . TVA may also post collateral for TVA's currency swaps, for commodity derivatives under the FHP, or for certain transactions with third parties that require TVA to post letters of credit.

 TVA and the U.S. Treasury, pursuant to the TVA Act, have entered into a memorandum of understanding under which the U.S. Treasury provides TVA with a million credit facility. This credit facility was renewed for 2025 with a maturity date of September 30, 2025. Access to this credit facility or other similar financing arrangements with the U.S. Treasury has been available to TVA since the 1960s. TVA can borrow under the U.S. Treasury credit facility only if it cannot issue Bonds in the market on reasonable terms, and TVA considers the U.S. Treasury credit facility a secondary source of liquidity. The interest rate on any borrowing under this facility is based on the average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the U.S. with maturities from date of issue of 12 months or less. There were outstanding borrowings under the facility at September 30, 2024. The availability of this credit facility may be impacted by how the U.S. government addresses the possibility of approaching its debt limit.

Cash Flow Hedging Strategy for Currency Swaps 
 
 To protect against exchange rate risk related to British pound sterling denominated Bond transactions, TVA entered into foreign currency hedges at the time the Bond transactions occurred. 
 million million 
 
 When the dollar strengthens against the British pound sterling, the exchange gain on the Bond liability and related accrued interest is offset by an equal amount of loss on the swap contract that is reclassified out of AOCI. Conversely, the exchange loss on the Bond liability and related accrued interest is offset by an equal amount of gain on the swap contract that is reclassified out of AOCI. All such exchange gains or losses on the Bond liability and related accrued interest are included in Long-term debt, net and Accrued interest, respectively. The offsetting exchange losses or gains on the swap contracts are recognized in AOCI. If any gain (loss) were to be incurred as a result of the early termination of the foreign currency swap contract, the resulting income (expense) would be amortized over the remaining life of the associated Bond as a component of Interest expense. The values of the currency swap liabilities are included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 million and the reduction in unrealized losses of million, respectively. TVA may hold short-term debt balances lower than the notional amount of the interest rate swaps from time to time due to changes in business conditions and other factors. While actual balances vary, TVA generally plans to maintain average balances of short-term debt equal to or in excess of the combined notional amount of the interest rate swaps. 
 
 Commodity Derivatives . TVA enters into certain derivative contracts for natural gas that require physical delivery of the contracted quantity of the commodity. TVA may also enter into short-term PPAs with a term of less than one year that provide an option to financially settle contracted power deliveries. This option creates an embedded derivative in the hosting power purchase agreement. TVA marks to market these contracts and defers the unrealized gains (losses) as regulatory liabilities (assets). At September 30, 2024, TVA's natural gas contract derivatives had terms of up to four years. 
 million mmBtu million mmBtu 
 
 Commodity Derivatives under the FHP. Currently, TVA is hedging exposure to the price of natural gas under the FHP. There is no Value at Risk aggregate transaction limit under the current FHP structure, but the TVA Board reviews and authorizes the use of tolerances and measures annually. TVA's FHP policy prohibits trading financial instruments under the FHP for speculative purposes. At September 30, 2024, TVA's natural gas swap contracts under the FHP had remaining terms of up to four years.

 (1) Offsetting amounts include counterparty netting of derivative contracts. Except as discussed below, there were no other material offsetting amounts on TVA's Consolidated Balance Sheets at either September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 (2) At September 30, 2024, the gross derivative asset and gross derivative liability was million and million, respectively, with offsetting amounts for each totaling million. At September 30, 2023, the gross derivative asset and gross derivative liability were million and million, respectively, with offsetting amounts for each totaling million. 
 million and million were posted as collateral at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to partially secure the liability positions of one of the interest rate swaps in accordance with the collateral requirements for this derivative. 
 
 Other Derivative Instruments 
 
 Investment Fund Derivatives . Investment funds consist primarily of funds held in the NDT, ART, SERP, DCP, and RP. See Note 16 Fair Value Measurements Investment Funds for a discussion of the trusts, plans, and types of investments. The NDT and ART may invest in derivative instruments which may include swaps, futures, options, forwards, and other instruments. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the NDT held investments in forward contracts to purchase debt securities. The fair values of these derivatives were in net asset positions totaling million at both September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Collateral . TVA's interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and commodity derivatives under the FHP contain contract provisions that require a party to post collateral (in a form such as cash or a letter of credit) when the party's liability balance under the agreement exceeds a certain threshold. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that were in a liability position was billion. TVA's collateral obligations at September 30, 2024, under these arrangements were million, for which TVA had posted million in letters of credit. These letters of credit reduce the available balance under the related credit facilities. TVA's assessment of the risk of its nonperformance includes a reduction in its exposure under the interest rate swap contracts as a result of this posted collateral. 
 
 For all of its derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features: 
 
 If TVA remains a majority-owned U.S. government entity but S P Global Ratings ("S P") or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") downgrades TVA's credit rating to AA or Aa2, respectively, TVA's collateral obligations would likely increase by million, and 
 
 If TVA ceases to be majority-owned by the U.S. government, TVA's credit rating would likely be downgraded and TVA would be required to post additional collateral. 
 
 Counterparty Risk 
 
 TVA may be exposed to certain risks when a counterparty has the potential to fail to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms. These risks may be related to credit, operational, or nonperformance matters. To mitigate certain counterparty risk, TVA analyzes the counterparty's financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establishes credit limits, monitors the appropriateness of those limits, as well as any changes in the creditworthiness of the counterparty, on an ongoing basis, and when required, employs credit mitigation measures, such as collateral or prepayment arrangements and master purchase and sale agreements.

 billion and billion of receivables from power sales outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, nearly all of the counterparties were rated investment grade. The majority of the obligations of these customers that are not investment grade are secured by collateral. TVA is also exposed to risk from exchange power arrangements with a small number of investor-owned regional utilities related to either delivered power or the replacement of open positions of longer-term purchased power or fuel agreements. TVA believes its policies and procedures for counterparty performance risk reviews have generally protected TVA against significant exposure related to market and economic conditions. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts, Note 3 Accounts Receivable, Net , and Note 9 Other Long-Term Assets . 
 
 TVA had revenue from LPCs that collectively accounted for percent of total operating revenues for both the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Suppliers. TVA assesses potential supplier performance risks, including procurement of fuel, purchased power, parts, and services. If suppliers are unable to perform under TVA's existing contracts or if TVA is unable to obtain similar services or supplies from other vendors, TVA could experience delays, disruptions, additional costs, or other operational outcomes that may impact generation, maintenance, and capital programs. If certain fuel or purchased power suppliers fail to perform under the terms of their contract with TVA, TVA might lose the money that it paid to the supplier under the contract and have to purchase replacement fuel or power on the spot market, perhaps at a significantly higher price than TVA was entitled to pay under the contract. In addition, TVA might not be able to acquire replacement fuel or power in a timely manner and thus might be unable to satisfy its own obligations to deliver power. TVA continues evaluating potential supplier performance risks and supplier impact but cannot determine or predict the duration of such risks/impacts or the extent to which such risks/impacts could affect TVA's business, operations, and financial results or cause potential business disruptions. 
 
 TVA continues to experience impacts due to inflation, supply chain material challenges, and labor availability. This has led to project delays, limited availability, and/or price increases for supplies and labor. TVA has been able to manage these challenges with limited business disruptions at this time; however, should pressures continue long term, TVA could experience more significant disruptions and pressure to further increase power rates. 
 
 Natural Gas and Fuel Oil . TVA purchases a significant amount of its natural gas requirements through contracts with a variety of suppliers and purchases substantially all of its fuel oil requirements on the spot market. TVA delivers to its gas fleet under firm and non-firm transportation contracts on multiple interstate natural gas pipelines. TVA contracts for storage capacity that allows for operational flexibility and increased supply during peak gas demand scenarios or supply disruptions. TVA uses contracts of various lengths and terms to meet the projected natural gas needs of its natural gas fleet. TVA also maintains on-site, fuel oil backup to operate at the majority of the combustion turbine sites in the event of major supply disruptions. In the event a supplier experiences an incident that limits its ability to fulfill its firm contractual obligations to supply TVA with natural gas, TVA intends to leverage its storage and balancing services and/or replace the volume with a third party to ensure reliability of generation. 
 
 Coal . To help ensure a reliable supply of coal, TVA had coal contracts with multiple suppliers at September 30, 2024. The contracted supply of coal is sourced from several geographic regions of the U.S. and is delivered via barge and rail. As a result of emerging technologies, environmental regulations, industry trends, and natural gas market volatility over the past few years, coal suppliers are facing increased financial pressure, which has led to relatively poor credit ratings and bankruptcies, restructuring, mine closures, or other scenarios. A long-term continued decline in demand for coal could result in more consolidations, additional bankruptcies, restructuring, mine closures, or other scenarios. 
 
 Nuclear Fuel . Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential nonperformance of counterparties. In the event of nonperformance by these or other suppliers, TVA believes that replacement uranium concentrate and nuclear fuel services can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. 
 
 Purchased Power . TVA acquires power from a variety of power producers through long-term and short-term PPAs as well as through spot market purchases. Because of the reliability risk of purchased power, TVA requires that the PPAs contain certain counterparty performance assurance requirements to help insure counterparty performance during the term of the agreements. 
 
 Other Suppliers . Mounting solar supply chain constraints, commodity price increases, and the trade policy investigation into solar panel imports have created challenges for the U.S. solar industry. TVA's existing solar PPA portfolio is not immune from these challenges. Similar to the experience of the rest of the industry, the majority of TVA's contracted PPAs from previous requests for proposals ("RFPs") that are not yet online have been impacted by project delays and price increases.

A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy (where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest) is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. 
 
 The following sections describe the valuation methodologies TVA uses to measure different financial instruments at fair value. Except for gains and losses on SERP, DCP, and RP assets, all changes in fair value of these assets and liabilities have been recorded as changes in regulatory assets, regulatory liabilities, or AOCI on TVA's Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Except for gains and losses on SERP and DCP assets, there has been no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows related to these fair value measurements. 
 
 Investment Funds 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Investment funds were comprised of billion of equity securities and debt securities classified as trading measured at fair value. Equity and trading debt securities are held in the NDT, ART, SERP, DCP, and RP. The NDT holds funds for the ultimate decommissioning of TVA's nuclear power plants. The ART holds funds primarily for the costs related to the future closure and retirement of TVA's other long-lived assets. The balances in the NDT and ART were billion and billion, respectively, at September 30, 2024. 
 
 TVA established a SERP to provide benefits to selected employees of TVA which are comparable to those provided by competing organizations. The DCP is designed to provide participants with the ability to defer compensation to future periods. The RP is a non-qualified excess 401(k) plan designed to allow certain eligible employees whose contributions to the 401(k) plan are limited by Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") rules to save additional amounts for retirement and receive non-elective and matching employer contributions. The NDT, ART, SERP, DCP, and RP funds are invested in portfolios of securities generally designed to achieve a return in line with overall equity and debt market performance.

 -to- -year period where the investor contributes capital, followed by a period of distribution, typically over several years. The investment period is generally, at a minimum, years or longer. The NDT had unfunded commitments related to private equity limited partnerships of million, private real assets of million, and private credit of million at September 30, 2024. The ART had unfunded commitments related to limited partnerships in private equity of million, private real assets of million, and private credit of million at September 30, 2024. These investments have no redemption or limited redemption options and may also impose restrictions on the NDT's and ART's ability to liquidate their investments. There are readily available quoted exchange prices for these investments. The fair value of these investments is based on information provided by the investment managers. These investments are valued on a quarterly basis. TVA's private equity limited partnerships, private real asset investments, and private credit investments are valued at net asset values ("NAV") as a practical expedient for fair value. TVA classifies its interest in these types of investments as investments measured at NAV in the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Commingled funds represent investment funds comprising multiple individual financial instruments. The commingled funds held by the NDT, ART, SERP, DCP, and RP consist of either a single class of securities, such as equity, debt, or foreign currency securities, or multiple classes of securities. All underlying positions in these commingled funds are either exchange traded or measured using observable inputs for similar instruments. The fair value of commingled funds is based on NAV per fund share (the unit of account), derived from the prices of the underlying securities in the funds. These commingled funds can be redeemed at the measurement date NAV and are classified as Commingled funds measured at NAV in the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity and trading debt securities are recognized in current earnings and are based on average cost. The gains and losses of the NDT and ART are subsequently reclassified to a regulatory asset or liability account in accordance with TVA's regulatory accounting policy. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cost-Based Regulation and Note 10 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities .

 percent of TVA's Revenue from sales of electricity for both the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was from LPCs, which then distribute the power to their customers using their own distribution systems. Power is delivered to each LPC at delivery points within the LPC's service territory. TVA recognizes revenue when the customer takes possession of the power at the delivery point. For power sales, the performance obligation to deliver power is satisfied in a series over time because the sales of electricity over the term of the customer contract are a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. TVA has no continuing performance obligations subsequent to delivery. Using the output method for revenue recognition provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of electricity as customers obtain control of the power and benefit from its use at delivery. Additionally, TVA has an enforceable right to consideration for energy delivered at any discrete point in time and will recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which TVA is entitled for the energy delivered. The amount of revenue is based on contractual prices approved by the TVA Board. Customers are invoiced monthly for power delivered as measured by meters located at the delivery points. The net transaction price is offset by certain credits available to customers that are known at the time of billing. Credits are designed to achieve objectives of the TVA Act and include items such as hydro preference credits for residential customers of LPCs, economic development credits to promote growth in the Tennessee Valley, wholesale bill credits to maintain long-term partnerships with LPCs, pandemic credits, and demand response credits allowing TVA to reduce industrial customer usage in periods of peak demand to balance system demand. The pandemic credits ended September 30, 2023. Payments are typically due within approximately one month of invoice issuance. 
 Directly served customers Directly served customers, including industrial customers, federal agencies, and other customers, take power for their own consumption. Similar to LPCs, power is delivered to a delivery point, at which time the customer takes possession and TVA recognizes revenue. For all power sales, the performance obligation to deliver power is satisfied in a series over time since the sales of electricity over the term of the customer contract are a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. TVA has no continuing performance obligations subsequent to delivery. Using the output method for revenue recognition provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of electricity as customers obtain control of the power and benefit from its use at delivery.

 Other Revenue 
 
 Other revenue consists primarily of wheeling and network transmission charges, sales of excess steam that is a by-product of power production, delivery point charges for interconnection points between TVA and the customer, REC sales, and certain other ancillary goods or services.

 TVA and LPCs continue to work together to meet the changing needs of consumers around the Tennessee Valley. In 2019, the TVA Board approved a Partnership Agreement option that better aligns the length of LPC power contracts with TVA's long-term commitments. Under the partnership arrangement, the LPC power contracts automatically renew each year and have a 20-year termination notice. The partnership arrangements can be terminated under certain circumstances, including TVA's failure to limit rate increases to no more than 10 percent during any consecutive five-fiscal-year period, as more specifically described in the agreements. Participating LPCs receive benefits including a percent wholesale bill credit in exchange for their long-term commitment, which enables TVA to recover its long-term financial commitments over a commensurate period. The total wholesale bill credits to LPCs participating in the Partnership Agreement were million, million, and million, respectively, for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022. In 2020, TVA provided participating LPCs a flexibility option, named Generation Flexibility, that allows them to locally generate or purchase up to approximately five percent of their average total hourly energy sales over a certain time period in order to meet their individual customers' needs. Revised flexibility agreements were made available to LPCs in August 2023 which permit projects to be located anywhere in TVA's service area, either connected to the LPC distribution system or TVA's transmission system, and make it easier for LPCs to partner in projects. As of September 30, 2024, LPCs had signed the Partnership Agreement with TVA, and LPCs had signed a Power Supply Flexibility Agreement.

 Note 
 (1) Ordinarily, the LPCs and TVA have the same termination notice period; however, in a contract with one of the LPCs with a five-year termination notice, TVA has a 10-year termination notice (which becomes a five-year termination notice if TVA loses its discretionary wholesale rate-setting authority). Certain LPCs have five-year termination notices or a shorter period if any act of Congress, court decision, or regulatory change requires or permits that election. 
 
 TVA's two largest LPCs Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division ("MLGW") and Nashville Electric Service ("NES") have contracts with a five-year and a 20-year termination notice period, respectively. Sales to MLGW and NES accounted for percent and percent, respectively, of TVA's total operating revenues in 2024, 2023, and 2022.

20. Benefit Plans 
 
 TVA sponsors a pension plan that covers most of its full-time employees hired prior to July 1, 2014, a qualified defined contribution plan ("401(k) plan") that covers most of its full-time employees, two unfunded post-retirement health care plans that provide for non-vested contributions toward the cost of eligible retirees' medical coverage, other post-employment benefits such as workers' compensation, the Restoration Plan, and the SERP. The pension plan and the 401(k) plan are administered by a separate legal entity, the TVA Retirement System ("TVARS"), which is governed by its own board of directors (the "TVARS Board"). 
 
 Overview of Plans and Benefits 
 
 Retirement Plans. The participants in the pension plan receive either a traditional final average pay pension or a cash balance pension. The traditional pension benefit is based on the participant's creditable service, average monthly salary for the participant's highest three consecutive years of eligible compensation, and a pension factor based on the participant's age and years of service, less a Social Security offset. The cash balance pension benefit is based on pay and interest credits accumulated in the participant's account and the participant's age. 
 
 Participants in the pension plan are also eligible to receive 401(k) plan matching contributions, may be eligible to receive 401(k) plan non-elective contributions, and may be eligible to make after-tax contributions of up to per year to the pension plan, which at the election of the participant are invested in either the fixed fund, which receives a fixed interest rate set forth in the plan, or the variable fund, which receives a rate of return based on an S P 500 index fund. Participants in the pension plan may also become eligible for a supplemental pension benefit based on age and years of service at retirement, which is provided to help offset the cost of retiree medical insurance. Employees first hired on or after July 1, 2014, are participants in the 401(k) plan only and receive both non-elective and matching contributions to their accounts in the 401(k) plan. 
 
 401(k) Plan . Under the 401(k) plan, the non-elective and matching contributions TVA makes to participant accounts depends on the employee's hire date, years of service, and individual elections. Non-elective employer contributions for eligible participants range from three percent to six percent and matching employer contributions range from 1.5 percent to six percent. TVA recognized 401(k) contribution costs of million, million, and million during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 
 
 Restoration Plan . TVA established the Restoration Plan, a nonqualified excess 401(k) plan, to allow certain eligible employees whose contributions to the 401(k) plan are limited by IRS rules to save additional amounts for retirement and receive non-elective and matching employer contributions. TVA recognized Restoration Plan benefit costs of million in 2024 and less than million in 2023. 
 
 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. TVA has established a SERP for certain executives in critical positions to provide supplemental pension benefits tied to compensation that exceeds limits imposed by IRS rules applicable to the qualified defined benefit pension plan. 
 
 Other Post-Retirement Benefits. TVA sponsors two unfunded post-retirement benefit plans that provide for non-vested contributions toward the cost of certain eligible retirees' medical coverage. The first plan covers only certain retirees and surviving dependents who do not qualify for TVARS benefits, including the supplemental pension benefit. The second plan is designed to place a limit on the out-of-pocket amount certain eligible retirees pay for medical coverage and provides a credit based on years of TVA service and monthly base pension amount, reduced by any TVARS supplemental pension benefits or any TVA contribution from the first plan, described above. In January 2017, TVA began providing all Medicare-eligible retirees and spouses Medicare supplement coverage through a private exchange. Transition to the exchange did not affect any TVARS supplemental benefits for eligible retirees, and the credit continues to be calculated in the same manner as before.

Table of Contents 

Other Post-Employment Benefits. TVA employees injured in work-related incidents are covered by the workers' compensation program for federal employees administered through the Department of Labor by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs in accordance with the provisions of FECA. FECA provides compensation and medical benefits to federal employees for permanent and temporary disability due to employment-related injury or disease. 
 
 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average future expected working lifetime of participants expected to receive benefits, which is approximately 11 years for the pension plan and 15 years for the post-retirement plans. 
 
 Amortization of Prior Service Cost/(Credit). Amortization of net prior service cost/(credit) resulting from a plan change is included as a component of period expense in the year first recognized and every year thereafter until it is fully amortized. The increase or decrease in the benefit obligation due to the plan change is amortized over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. The pension and post-retirement plans currently have prior service costs/(credits) from plan changes made in 2016, 2018, and 2021 with remaining amortization periods ranging from one to five years. However, when a plan change reduces the benefit obligation, existing positive prior service costs are reduced or eliminated starting with the earliest established before a new prior service credit base is established. 
 
 Asset Method . TVA's asset method calculates a market-related value of assets ("MRVA") that recognizes realized and unrealized investment gains and losses over a three-year smoothing period to decrease the volatility of annual net periodic pension benefit costs. The MRVA is used to determine the expected return on plan assets, a component of net periodic pension benefit cost. The difference in the expected return on the MRVA and the actual return on the fair value on plan assets is recognized as an actuarial (gain)/loss in the pension benefit obligation at September 30. However, the MRVA has no impact on the fair value of plan assets measured at September 30.

 For 2024, the billion pension benefit obligation actuarial loss was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate from percent to percent, which increased the liability by million. In addition, TVA recognized a million actuarial loss due to higher COLA and higher interest crediting rates than previously assumed for CY 2025, and a million actuarial loss due to observed plan experience. These losses were offset by a 5 million actuarial gain due to mortality assumption changes. 
 
 For 2023, the million pension benefit obligation actuarial gain was primarily due to the increase in the discount rate from percent to percent, which decreased the liability by million. In addition, based on the results obtained from the 2023 experience study, TVA recognized actuarial gains of 23 million due to the revision in demographic and other experience related assumptions to reflect anticipated future plan experience. These gains were partially offset by a 61 million actuarial loss due to higher COLA and higher interest crediting rates than previously assumed for CY 2024, and a million actuarial loss due to observed plan experience. 
 
 The other post-retirement actuarial gain for 2024 decreased the benefit obligation by million. TVA recognized a 30 million actuarial gain as a result of updating the pre-Medicare health care cost trend rates to reflect observed and anticipated plan experience. Based upon results obtained from a study on post-retirement experience conducted in 2024, TVA recognized a 13 million actuarial gain due to the adoption of a retiree persistency assumption and a 2 million actuarial gain related to changes in the withdrawal assumption rates. In addition, TVA recognized a 2 million gain due to observed plan experience. These gains were partially offset by a million actuarial loss from the decrease in the discount rate from percent to percent.

 The other post-retirement actuarial gain for 2023 decreased the benefit obligation by million. TVA recognized a million actuarial gain primarily due to lower retirement rate assumptions than previously assumed and actuarial gains of million due to the revision of demographic and other experience related assumptions to reflect anticipated future plan experience based on the results obtained from the 2023 experience study. In addition, TVA recognized a million actuarial gain from the increase in the discount rate from percent to percent. These gains were partially offset by a million actuarial loss to reflect observed and anticipated plan experience for contribution costs and pre-Medicare per capita claims costs and a million actuarial loss due to changes in the pre-Medicare per capita claims cost trend rate assumptions.

 Plan Assumptions 
 
 Plan assumptions utilized to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs include discount rates, projected health care cost trend rates, COLAs, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of increase in future compensation levels, retirement rates, expected timing and form of payments, and mortality rates, of which certain key assumptions are noted below. Every five years, a formal actuarial experience study that compares assumptions to the actual experience is conducted. Additional ad-hoc experience studies are performed as needed to review recent experience and validate recommended changes to the actuarial assumptions used based upon TVA's latest experience study in 2023.

 Notes 
 (1) The actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations at September 30 of each year are subsequently used to determine net periodic benefit cost 
 for the following year except the rate of compensation increase assumption. 
 (2) The actual return on assets for 2024, 2023, and 2022 was percent, percent, and ) percent, respectively. 
 (3) The COLA assumption rate is the ultimate rate. The actual calendar year rate is used in determining the expense, and for years thereafter the ultimate rate is used. 
 
 Discount Rate. In selecting the assumed discount rate, TVA reviews market yields on high-quality corporate debt and endeavors to match, through the use of a hypothetical bond portfolio, instrument maturities with the maturities of its pension obligations in accordance with the prevailing accounting standards. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of high quality corporate bonds of Aa-rated quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected. 
 
 Expected Return on Plan Assets . The qualified defined benefit pension plan is the only plan that is funded with qualified plan assets. The expected rate of return is based on annual studies performed by third-party professional investment consultants. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, TVA uses a process that incorporates actual historical asset class returns and an assessment of expected future performance and takes into consideration external actuarial advice, the current outlook on capital markets, the asset allocation policy, and the anticipated investment expenses and impact of active management. Asset allocations are periodically updated using the pension plan asset/liability studies and are part of the determination of the estimates of long-term rates of return. The TVARS asset allocation policy diversifies plan assets across multiple asset classes so as to minimize the risk of large losses. The asset allocation policy is designed to be responsive to changes in the funded status of TVARS. In September 2023, the TVARS Board approved a new asset allocation policy, but had no changes in 2023 and 2024 to the 6.50 percent expected return on assets assumption adopted in 2022. 
 
 Compensation Increases . Assumptions related to compensation increases are based upon the latest TVA compensation experience study performed in 2023. Future compensation is assumed to likely increase at rates between percent and percent per year, depending upon the employee's age, and is used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost. The average assumed compensation increase is based upon the current active participants. 
 
 Mortality. The mortality assumption is comprised of a base table that represents the current future life expectancy adjusted by an improvement scale to project future improvements in life expectancy. TVA's mortality assumptions are based upon actuarial projections in combination with studies of the actual mortality experience of TVA's pension and post-retirement benefit plan participants while taking into consideration the published Society of Actuaries ("SOA") mortality table and projection scale at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The following mortality assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations for the pension and other post-retirement benefit plans at September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Assumptions used to determine year-end benefit obligations are the assumptions used to determine the subsequent year's net periodic benefit costs.

 Health Care Cost Trends. The health care cost trend rates are assumptions about the annual rate of changes in the cost of health care benefits currently provided by the post-retirement benefit plan. In establishing health care cost trend rates, TVA reviews actual recent cost trends and projected future trends considering health care inflation, changes in health care utilization, and changes in plan benefits and premium experience. 
 
 Cost of Living Adjustment. COLAs are an increase in the benefits for eligible retirees to help maintain the purchasing power of benefits as consumer prices increase. Eligible retirees receive COLAs on pension and supplemental benefits in January based on a formula linked to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ("CPI-U") following any year in which the calculation is at least one percent. Increases in COLA will be the percentage change in average CPI-U for the current 12-month period (November - October) compared to the average CPI-U for the previous 12-month period (November - October) for which a COLA was given, less percent, with a percent cap for any one year. 
 
 TVA's COLA assumption is derived from long-term expectations of the expected future rate of inflation, based upon capital market assumptions, economic forecasts, and the Federal Reserve policy. The actual calendar year COLA and the long- term COLA assumption are used to determine the benefit obligation at September 30 and the net periodic benefit costs for the following fiscal year. The actual calendar year COLAs for 2024, 2023, and 2022 were percent, percent, and percent, respectively.

 Plan Investments 
 
 In September 2023, based on current market conditions and updated capital market assumptions, the asset allocation policy was modified to progress towards the goal of reducing risk and volatility in the TVARS investment portfolio. TVARS investments are being reallocated in a prudent manner over time to move toward the new asset allocation targets. Pursuant to the TVARS Rules and Regulations, any proposed changes in asset allocation that would change TVARS's assumed rate of investment return are subject to the review and veto of the TVA Board. The qualified pension plan assets are invested across growth, defensive-growth, defensive, and inflation-sensitive assets. The TVARS asset allocation policy includes permissible deviations from target allocations, and action can be taken, as appropriate, to rebalance the plan's assets consistent with the asset allocation policy. 
 Defensive growth assets Defensive assets Inflation-sensitive assets Total

The following descriptions of the valuation methods and assumptions used by the pension plan to estimate the fair value of investments apply to investments held directly by the pension plan. Third-party pricing vendors provide valuations for investments held by the pension plan in most instances, except for commingled, private credit, private equity, and private real asset funds which are priced at NAVs established by the investment managers. In instances where pricing is determined to be based on unobservable inputs, a Level 3 classification has been assigned. Certain securities priced by the investment manager using a proprietary fair value model with unobservable inputs have been classified as Level 3. 
 
 Equity and Preferred Securities. Investments listed on either a national or foreign securities exchange or traded in the over-the-counter National Market System are generally valued each business day at the official closing price (typically the last reported sale price) on the exchange on which the security is primarily traded and are classified as Level 1. Equity securities, including common stocks and preferred securities, classified as Level 2 may have been priced by dealer quote or using assumptions based on observable market data, such as yields on bonds from the same issuer or industry. Certain securities priced by the investment manager using unobservable inputs have been classified as Level 3. 
 
 Corporate Debt Securities. Corporate bonds are valued based upon recent bid prices or the average of recent bid and asked prices when available (Level 2 inputs) and, if not available, they are valued through matrix pricing models. Matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique commonly used to price debt securities that are not actively traded, values debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). Certain securities priced by the investment manager using broker pricing or unobservable inputs have been classified as Level 3. 
 
 Mortgage and Asset-Backed Securities. Residential mortgage-backed securities consist of collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") and U.S. pass-through security pools related to government-sponsored enterprises. CMO pricing is typically based on either a volatility-driven, multidimensional, single-cash-flow stream model or an option-adjusted spread model. These models incorporate available market data such as trade information, dealer quotes, market color, spreads, bids, and offers. Pricing for government-sponsored enterprise securities, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and the Government National Mortgage Association, is typically based on quotes from the To Be Announced ("TBA") market, which is highly liquid with multiple electronic platforms that facilitate the execution of trading between investors and broker/dealers. Prices from the TBA market are then compared against other live data feeds as well as input obtained directly from the dealer community. Most residential mortgage-backed securities are considered to be priced using Level 2 inputs because of the nature of their market-data-based pricing models. Certain securities priced by vendors using a single broker quote or unobservable inputs have been classified as Level 3. 
 
 Commercial mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are typically priced based on a single-cash-flow stream model, which incorporates available market data such as trade information, dealer quotes, market color, spreads, bids, and offers. Because of the market-data-based nature of such pricing models, these securities are typically classified as Level 2. Certain securities priced by investment managers using broker pricing or unobservable inputs have been classified as Level 3. 
 
 Debt Securities Issued by U.S. Treasury. For U.S. Treasury securities, fair values reflect the closing price reported in the active market in which the security is traded (Level 1 inputs). 
 
 Debt Securities Issued by Foreign Governments. Foreign government bonds and foreign government inflation-linked securities are typically priced based on proprietary discounted cash flow models, incorporating option-adjusted spread features

 as appropriate. Debt securities issued by foreign governments are classified as Level 2 because of the nature of their market-data-based pricing models. Certain securities priced by the investment manager using broker quotes or unobservable input have been classified as Level 3. 
 
 Debt Securities Issued by State and Local Governments . Debt securities issued by state and local governments are typically priced using market-data-based pricing models, and are therefore classified as Level 2. These pricing models incorporate market data such as quotes, trading levels, spread relationships, and yield curves, as applicable. 
 
 Commingled Funds . The pension plan invests in commingled funds, which include collective trusts, unit investment trusts, and similar investment funds that predominantly hold debt and/or equity securities as underlying assets. The pension plan's ownership consists of a pro rata share and not a direct ownership of an underlying investment. These commingled funds are valued at their closing NAVs (or unit value) per share as reported by the managers of the commingled funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchases and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. These funds have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy in accordance with FASB guidance issued in May 2015. 
 
 The pension plan is invested in equity commingled funds, which can be categorized as either passively managed index funds or actively managed funds. The equity index funds seek to track the performance of a particular index by replicating its capitalization and characteristics. Passive fund benchmark indices include the Russell 1000 index and MSCI ACWI ex-U.S. index. The actively managed equity funds seek to outperform certain equity benchmarks through a combination of fundamental and technical analysis. Active funds select portfolio positions based upon their research. 
 
 The pension plan is invested in debt commingled funds, which can be categorized as either passively managed index funds or actively managed funds. The pension plan's debt index fund invests in a diversified portfolio of fixed-income securities and derivatives of varying maturities to replicate the characteristics of the Bloomberg Barclays Capital U.S. TIPS. The fund seeks to track the total return of the Bloomberg Barclays Capital U.S. TIPS index. The actively managed debt funds seek to outperform certain fixed-income benchmarks through fundamental research and analysis. The funds invest in a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities and derivatives of varying maturities. Varying by strategy, fund objectives include achieving a positive relative total return through active credit selection and providing risk management through desired strategic exposures. 
 
 The pension plan is invested in commingled funds, which invest across multiple asset classes that can be categorized as blended. These funds seek to outperform a passive benchmark through active security selection. The funds invest in securities across equity, fixed income, currency, and commodities. The portfolios employ fundamental, quantitative, and technical analysis. 
 
 The pension plan's investments in equity, debt, blended, and commodity commingled funds can generally be redeemed upon notification of the investment managers, with required notice periods varying from same-day to monthly. These investments do not have unfunded commitments. 
 
 Institutional Mutual Funds . Investments in institutional mutual funds are valued at prices based on their NAV. Institutional mutual funds have daily published market prices that represent their NAV (or unit value) per share and are classified as Level 1. 
 
 Cash Equivalents and Other Short-Term Investments and Certificates of Deposit . Cash equivalents and other short-term investments are highly liquid securities with maturities of less than three months and 12 months, respectively. These consist primarily of discount securities such as commercial paper, repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury bills, and certain agency securities. These securities, as well as certificates of deposit, may be priced at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. Model based pricing which incorporates observable inputs may also be utilized. These securities are classified as Level 2. Active market pricing may be utilized for U.S. Treasury bills, which are classified as Level 1. 
 
 Private Credit Funds . Private credit limited partnerships are reported at NAVs provided by the fund managers. These funds have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy in accordance with FASB guidance issued in May 2015. 
 
 The private credit limited partnerships invest across direct lending, opportunistic credit, and distressed debt strategies. The limited partnerships generally make investments of senior secured first-lien loans, second-lien secured loans, asset-based loans, risk transfer loans, specialty finance loans, unitranche loans, and distressed debt opportunities to middle market private companies. The limited partnerships generally seek to obtain financial returns through high income potential and occasional equity upside. The limited partnerships generally have a term life of five to eight years and are diversified by sector and industry. 
 
 Private Equity Funds. Private equity limited partnerships are reported at NAVs provided by the fund managers. These funds have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy in accordance with FASB guidance issued in May 2015. 
 
 The private equity limited partnerships typically make longer-term investments in private companies and seek to obtain financial returns through long-term appreciation based on corporate stewardship, improved operating processes, and financial restructuring which may involve a merger or acquisition. Significant investment strategies include venture capital, buyout, 
 152 

Table of Contents 

 mezzanine or subordinated debt, restructuring or distressed debt, and special situations. Venture capital partnerships consist of two main groupings. Early-stage venture capital partnerships invest in businesses still in the conceptual stage where products may not be fully developed and where revenues and/or profits may be several years away. Later-stage venture capital partnerships invest in more mature companies in need of growth or expansion capital. Buyout partnerships provide the equity capital for acquisition transactions either from a private seller or the public, which may represent the purchase of the entire company or a refinancing or recapitalization transaction where equity is invested. Mezzanine or subordinated debt partnerships provide the intermediate capital between equity and senior debt in a buyout or refinancing transaction and typically own a security in the company that carries current interest payments as well as a potential equity interest in the company. Restructuring or distressed debt partnerships purchase opportunities generated by overleveraged or poorly managed companies. Special situation partnerships include organizations with a specific industry focus not covered by the other private equity subclasses or unique opportunities that fall outside the regular subclasses. 
 
 The private equity funds have no investment withdrawal provisions prior to the termination of the partnership. Partnerships generally continue to years after the inception of the fund. The partnerships are generally subject to to one-year extensions at the discretion of the General Partner. Partnerships can generally be dissolved by an percent vote in interest by all limited partners, with some funds requiring the occurrence of a specific event. 
 
 Private Real Asset Investments. The pension plan's ownership in private real asset investments consists of a pro rata share and not a direct ownership of the underlying investments. The fair values of the pension plan's private real asset investments are estimated utilizing NAVs provided by the investment managers. These investments have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy in accordance with FASB guidance issued in May 2015. The investment strategies and methodologies utilized by the investment managers to calculate their NAVs are summarized as follows: 
 
 The pension plan is invested in limited partnerships that invest in real estate securities, real estate partnerships, and direct real estate properties. This includes investments in office, multifamily, industrial, and retail investment properties in the U.S. and international markets. The investment strategy focuses on distressed, opportunistic, and value-added opportunities. Partnership investments also include mortgage and/or real estate-related fixed-income instruments and related securities. Investments are diversified by property type and geographic location. 
 
 The pension plan is invested in a commingled fund that develops, renovates, and re-leases real estate properties to create value. Investments are predominantly in top tier real estate markets that offer deep liquidity. Property types include residential, office, industrial, hotel, retail, and land. Properties are diversified by geographic region within the U.S. domestic market. The plan is invested in a second commingled fund that invests primarily in core, well-leased, operating real estate properties with a focus on income generation. Investments are diversified by property type with a focus on office, industrial, apartment, and retail. Properties are diversified within the U.S. with an overweight to major market and coastal regions. 
 
 Fair value estimates of the underlying investments in these limited partnerships and commingled fund investments are primarily based upon property appraisal reports prepared by independent real estate appraisers within a reasonable amount of time following acquisition of the real estate and no less frequently than annually thereafter. The appraisals are based on one or a combination of three methodologies: cost of reproduction analysis, discounted cash flow analysis, and sales comparison analysis. Pricing for certain investments in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities is typically based on models that incorporate observable inputs. 
 
 The pension plan is invested in energy infrastructure partnerships that acquire essential, long-lived real assets in three main groupings. Upstream assets include oil and gas exploration, drilling, and acquisition. Midstream assets include storage, pipelines, gathering, processing, and transportation of energy commodities. Downstream assets include generation, distribution, and transmission facilities. Additionally, the pension plan is invested in infrastructure partnerships that target mid-sized operating infrastructure companies and/or assets with limited development and construction risk primarily in the energy, transportation and logistics, environmental, telecommunications, and social industries. The partnerships use one or more valuation techniques (e.g., the market approach, the income approach, or the cost approach) for which sufficient and reliable data is available. The use of the market approach generally consists of using comparable market transactions, while the use of the income approach generally consists of the net present value of estimated future cash flows, adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, credit, market, and/or other risk factors. 
 
 The pension plan is invested in a private real asset investment trust formed to make direct or indirect investments in commercial timberland properties. Pricing for these types of investments is based on comprehensive appraisals that are conducted shortly after initial purchase of properties and at three-year intervals thereafter. All appraisals are conducted by third-party timberland appraisal firms. Appraisals are based on either a sales comparison analysis or a discounted cash flow analysis. 
 
 Securities Lending Collateral . Collateral held under securities lending arrangements is invested in highly liquid short-term securities, primarily repurchase agreements. The securities are often priced at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. These securities are classified as Level 2. 
 
 Derivatives. The pension plan invests in a variety of derivative instruments. The valuation methodologies for these instruments are as follows: 
 153 

Table of Contents 

Futures . The pension plan enters into futures. The futures contracts are listed on either a national or foreign securities exchange and are generally valued each business day at the official closing price (typically the last reported sales price) on the exchange on which the security is primarily traded. The pricing is performed by third-party vendors. Since futures are priced by an exchange in an active market, they are classified as Level 1. 
 
 Options . The pension plan enters into purchased and written options. Options that are listed on either a national or foreign securities exchange are generally valued each business day at the official closing price (typically the last reported sales price) on the exchange on which the security is primarily traded. These options are classified as Level 1. Options traded over the counter and not on exchanges are priced by third-party vendors and are classified as Level 2. 
 
 Swaps . The pension plan enters into various types of swaps. Credit default swaps are priced at market using models that consider cash flows, credit curves, recovery rates, and other factors. The pricing is performed by third-party vendors, and in some cases by clearing exchanges. Interest rate swap contracts are priced at market using forward rates derived from the swap curve, and the pricing is also performed by third-party vendors, and in some cases by clearing exchanges. Other swaps such as equity index swaps and variance swaps are priced by third-party vendors using market inputs such as spot rates, yield curves, and volatility. The pension plan's swaps are generally classified as Level 2 based on the observable nature of their pricing inputs. 
 
 Foreign currency forwards . The pension plan enters into foreign currency forwards. All commitments are marked to market daily at the applicable translation rates, and any resulting unrealized gains or losses are recorded. Foreign currency forwards are priced by third-party vendors and are classified as Level 2. 
 
 Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase . The pension plan enters into contracts to sell securities to a counterparty at a specified price with an agreement to purchase the same or substantially the same security from the same counterparty at a fixed or determinable price at a future date. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are presented at their contract price which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. These securities are classified as Level 2. In connection with sales of securities under agreements to repurchase, the counterparties require the pension plan to maintain collateral securities with a fair value that approximates or exceeds the contract amount of the repurchase agreement. These securities are held in government inflation-linked bonds and classified as government debt securities. 
 
 The valuation methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the TVARS Board believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

 Note 
 (1) Participants are assumed to receive the Fixed Fund in a lump sum in lieu of available annuity options allowed for certain grandfathered participants resulting in higher estimated pension benefits payments. 
 
 Contributions . TVA made contributions to the pension plan of million for 2024 and 2023. TVA has committed to make a minimum contribution of million per year through 2036 or until the plan has reached and remained at 100 percent funded status under the actuarial rules applicable to TVARS. TVA made SERP contributions of million and million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. TVA made cash contributions to the other post-retirement benefit plans of million (net of million in rebates) and million (net of million in rebates) for 2024 and 2023, respectively. TVA expects to contribute million to TVARS, 7 million to the SERP, and million to the other post-retirement benefit plans in 2025 .

 Other Post-Employment Benefits 
 
 Post-employment benefit cost estimates are revised to properly reflect changes in actuarial assumptions made at the end of each year. TVA utilizes a discount rate determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturities corresponding to the calculated average durations of TVA's future estimated post-employment claims payments. The use of a percent discount rate resulted in the recognition of million in expenses in 2024 and an unpaid benefit obligation of million at September 30, 2024. The use of a percent discount rate resulted in the recognition of approximately ) million in expenses in 2023 and an unpaid benefit obligation of million at September 30, 2023. The use of a percent discount rate resulted in the recognition of approximately ) million in expenses in 2022 and an unpaid benefit obligation of million at September 30, 2022. The U.S. Department of Labor ("DOL") administers TVA's worker compensation program and invoices TVA annually for claims processed. 
 
 The decrease in the unpaid obligation at September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year was due primarily to the decrease in overall claims experience offset by inflationary impacts on wage and medical costs and a decrease in the discount rate from percent in 2023 to percent in 2024. The DOL billed TVA million for 2024 claims due in October 2024. TVA estimated claims for 2025 are million. 
 
 The decrease in the unpaid obligation at September 30, 2023, compared to the prior year was due primarily to the increase in the discount rate from percent in 2022 to percent in 2023 and a decrease in claims. These decreases were partially offset by inflationary impacts on wage and medical costs and an increase in medical utilization previously delayed by the pandemic. TVA paid 29 million for 2023 claims to the DOL in October 2023. 
 
 The impact of inflation on wages, medical costs, and interest rates on the post-employment obligation depends on factors beyond TVA's knowledge or control, including the effects of supply chain disruptions and geographical tensions. 
 
 The current portion which represents unpaid losses and administrative fees due are in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The long-term portion is recognized in Post-retirement and post-employment benefit obligations. 
 
 Post-retirement and post-employment benefit obligations 

million for design costs incurred by GEH through 2026. At the time feasibility is determined, TVA will have the right to use the design and may receive additional economic benefits.

See Note 8 Leases , Note 11 Variable Interest Entities , Note 14 Debt and Other Obligations , and Note 20 Benefit Plans for the obligations and commitments attributable to leases, VIEs and membership interests of VIEs subject to mandatory redemption, leaseback obligations, and the retirement plan, respectively. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 Nuclear Insurance . Section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act, commonly known as the Price-Anderson Act, provides a layered framework of financial protection to compensate for liability claims of members of the public for personal injury and property damages arising from a nuclear incident in the U.S. This financial protection consists of layers of coverage. The primary level is private insurance underwritten by American Nuclear Insurers and provides public liability insurance coverage of million for each nuclear power plant licensed to operate. If this amount is not sufficient to cover claims arising from a nuclear incident, the second level, Secondary Financial Protection, applies. Within the Secondary Financial Protection level, the licensee of each nuclear reactor has a contingent obligation to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary level, regardless of proximity to the incident of fault, up to a maximum of million per reactor per incident. With TVA's reactors, the maximum total contingent obligation per incident is billion. This retrospective premium is payable at a maximum rate currently set at million per year per nuclear incident per reactor. Currently, reactors are participating in the Secondary Financial Protection program. 
 
 In the event that a nuclear incident results in public liability claims, the primary level provided by American Nuclear Insurers combined with the Secondary Financial Protection should provide up to billion in coverage. 
 
 Federal law requires that each NRC power reactor licensee obtain property insurance from private sources to cover the cost of stabilizing and decontaminating a reactor and its station site after an accident. TVA carries property, decommissioning liability, and decontamination liability insurance from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited ("NEIL") and European Mutual Association for Nuclear Insurance. The limits available for a loss are up to billion for two of TVA's nuclear sites and up to billion for the remaining site. Some of this insurance may require the payment of retrospective premiums up to a maximum of million. 
 
 TVA purchases accidental outage (business interruption) insurance for TVA's nuclear sites from NEIL. In the event that an accident covered by this policy takes a nuclear unit offline or keeps a nuclear unit offline, NEIL will pay TVA, after a waiting period, an indemnity (a set dollar amount per week) with a maximum indemnity of million per unit. This insurance policy may require the payment of retrospective premiums up to a maximum of million, but only to the extent the retrospective premium is deemed necessary by the NEIL Board of Directors to pay losses unable to be covered by NEIL's surplus. 
 
 Decommissioning Costs. TVA recognizes legal obligations associated with the future retirement of certain tangible long-lived assets related primarily to nuclear generating plants, coal-fired generating plants, hydroelectric generating plants/dams, transmission structures, and other property-related assets. See Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligations . 
 
 Nuclear Decommissioning . Provision for decommissioning costs of nuclear generating units is based on options prescribed by the NRC procedures to dismantle and decontaminate the facilities to meet the NRC criteria for license termination. At September 30, 2024, billion, representing the discounted value of future estimated nuclear decommissioning costs, was included in nuclear AROs. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the derived estimates because of, among other things, changes in current assumptions, such as the assumed dates of decommissioning, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in technology, and changes in the cost of labor, materials, and equipment. Utilities that own and operate nuclear plants are required to use different procedures in calculating nuclear decommissioning costs under GAAP than those that are used in calculating nuclear decommissioning costs when reporting to the NRC. The sets of procedures produce different estimates for the costs of decommissioning primarily because of differences in the underlying assumptions. TVA bases its nuclear decommissioning estimates on site-specific cost studies. The most recent study was approved and implemented in September 2022. Site-specific cost studies are updated for each of TVA's nuclear units at least every five years.

Table of Contents 

 billion, representing the discounted value of future estimated non-nuclear decommissioning costs, was included in non-nuclear AROs. This decommissioning cost estimate involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of the timing and duration of the asset retirement process and how costs will escalate with inflation. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the derived estimates because of changes in current assumptions, such as the assumed dates of decommissioning, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in technology, and changes in the cost of labor, materials, and equipment. TVA updates its underlying assumptions for non-nuclear decommissioning AROs at least every five years. However, material changes in underlying assumptions that impact the amount and timing of undiscounted cash flows are continuously monitored and incorporated into ARO balances in the period identified. 
 
 TVA maintains an ART to help fund the ultimate decommissioning of its non-nuclear power assets. See Note 16 Fair Value Measurements Investment Funds . Estimates involved in determining if additional funding will be made to the ART include inflation rate, rate of return projections on the fund investments, and the planned use of other sources to fund decommissioning costs. See Note 10 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Non-Nuclear Decommissioning Costs and Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligations . 
 
 Environmental Matters. TVA's generation activities, like those across the utility industry and in other industrial sectors, are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Major areas of regulation affecting TVA's activities include air quality control, greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, water quality control, and management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Regulations in these major areas continue to become more stringent and have, and will continue to have, a particular emphasis on climate change, renewable generation, and energy efficiency. 
 
 TVA has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, substantial capital and operating and maintenance costs to comply with evolving environmental requirements primarily associated with, but not limited to, the operation of TVA's coal-fired and natural gas-fired generating units in general and emissions of pollutants from those units. Environmental requirements placed on the operation of coal-fired and other generating units using fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas will likely continue to become more restrictive over time. Failure to comply with environmental and safety requirements can result in enforcement actions and litigation, which can lead to the imposition of significant civil liability, including fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, and/or temporary or permanent closure of non-compliant facilities. Historical non-compliance can also lead to difficulty in renewing existing permits, as well as difficulty in obtaining permits to bring new generation facilities online. Other obstacles to renewal or permitting of new facilities include a proliferation of non-government organizations seeking to use litigation tools to delay or stop altogether permitting of new fossil fuel facilities in favor of renewable energy projects . 
 
 Compliance with the 2015 CCR Rule required implementation of a groundwater monitoring program, additional engineering, evaluation of authorized closure methods, coordination with certain state authorities, and ongoing analysis at each TVA CCR unit. As further analyses are performed, including evaluation of monitoring results, there is the potential for additional costs for investigation and/or remediation. In addition, on May 8, 2024, EPA published its Legacy CCR Rule, which expands the scope of the existing regulatory requirements of the 2015 CCR Rule to include two additional classes of CCR units: Legacy SIs and CCRMUs. See Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligations . 
 
 In May 2024, EPA also published (1) a final rule that establishes more stringent technology-based effluent limitations for four waste streams from coal-fired plants, (2) a rule that strengthens and updates the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for electric generating units to reflect recent developments in control technologies, and (3) a rule that establishes GHG emission guidelines for existing coal-fired plants and GHG performance standards for new natural gas-fired power plants. These rules are all subject to legal challenges, and if the challenges are not successful, TVA would incur substantial costs to comply with the rules. 
 
 Liability for releases, natural resource damages, and required cleanup of hazardous substances is primarily regulated by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and other federal and parallel state statutes. In a manner similar to many other governmental entities, industries, and power systems, TVA has generated or used hazardous substances over the years. TVA operations at some facilities have resulted in releases of contaminants that TVA has addressed or is addressing consistent with state and federal requirements. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, TVA's estimated liability for required cleanup and similar environmental work for those sites for which sufficient information is available to develop a cost estimate was million and million, respectively, on a non-discounted basis, and was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-

 on a non-discounted basis and was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current estimated time frame for work related to these remediation activities for which TVA has a cost estimate is through 2046. 
 
 Potential Liability Associated with Workers' Exposure to CCR Materials. In response to the 2008 ash spill at Kingston, TVA hired Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. ("Jacobs") to oversee aspects of the cleanup. After the cleanup was completed, Jacobs was sued in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee ("Eastern District") by employees of a contractor involved in the cleanup and family members of some of the employees. The plaintiffs alleged that Jacobs failed to take or provide proper health precautions and misled workers about the health risks associated with exposure to coal fly ash, which is a CCR material. The plaintiffs also alleged that exposure to the fly ash caused significant illnesses, including in some cases death. Other contractor employees and family members also filed lawsuits against Jacobs in the Eastern District. In the third quarter of 2023, Jacobs announced that it reached a global settlement that resolved all of these lawsuits. While TVA was not a party to any of these lawsuits, Jacobs claimed that TVA had an indemnity obligation to reimburse Jacobs under TVA's contract with Jacobs. In August 2024, TVA entered into a settlement arrangement with Jacobs and its insurers that releases TVA from all past, present, and future claims under the contract. The settlement arrangement did not have a material adverse impact on TVA's results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, TVA is party to or otherwise involved in lawsuits, claims, proceedings, investigations, and other legal matters ("Legal Proceedings") that have arisen in the ordinary course of conducting TVA's activities. 
 
 General. At September 30, 2024, TVA had accrued million of probable losses with respect to Legal Proceedings. Of the accrued amount, million is included in Other long-term liabilities and million is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities. No assurance can be given that TVA will not be subject to significant additional claims and liabilities. If actual liabilities significantly exceed the estimates made, TVA's results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 Environmental Agreements . On April 14, 2011, TVA entered into two substantively similar agreements, one with the EPA and the other with Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and three environmental advocacy groups (collectively, the "Environmental Agreements"). To resolve alleged New Source Review claims, TVA committed under the Environmental Agreements to, among other things, take now-completed actions regarding coal units and invest million in certain TVA environmental projects. Of this amount, TVA had spent approximately million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, TVA holds restricted cash in an interest earning trust to fund the remaining project commitments. Any interest earned through the trust must also be spent on agreed upon environmental projects. The total remaining committed costs, including interest earned through the trust, were approximately million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The liabilities related to the Environmental Agreements are included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the September 30, 2024, Consolidated Balance Sheets. In conjunction with the approval of the Environmental Agreements, the TVA Board determined that it was appropriate to record TVA's obligations under the Environmental Agreements as regulatory assets, and they are included as such on the September 30, 2024, Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be recovered in rates in future periods. 
 
 Case Involving Johnsonville Aeroderivative Combustion Turbine Project. On December 22, 2022, the Southern Environmental Law Center filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee on behalf of the Sierra Club, alleging that TVA violated the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA") in deciding to build a new aeroderivative combustion turbine project at its Johnsonville facility. The Sierra Club claims that TVA violated NEPA by failing to adequately analyze the climate consequences of the project, adequately address GHG mitigation in light of EOs to decarbonize the power sector, consider a reasonable range of alternatives to the project, and prepare an environmental impact statement ("EIS"). The Sierra Club requests the federal court to enter a declaratory judgment that TVA's environmental assessment ("EA") violates NEPA and that TVA's decision to issue a finding of no significant impact ("FONSI") was arbitrary, vacate the EA and FONSI, order TVA to prepare an EIS, and prohibit further construction and operation of the combustion turbines until TVA has complied with NEPA. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and on September 30, 2024, the court granted TVA's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the lawsuit. The Sierra Club has 60 days from the date of the decision to appeal. 
 
 Case Involving Cumberland Combined Cycle Plant. On June 14, 2023, Appalachian Voices, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee alleging that TVA violated NEPA in deciding to build a 1,450 MW combined cycle plant at its Cumberland facility. The plaintiffs request the

 billion of the Power Program Appropriation Investment has been repaid in accordance with the 1959 amendment. TVA fulfilled its requirement to repay billion of the Power Program Appropriation Investment in 2014. The TVA Act requires TVA to continue making payments to the U.S. Treasury as a return on the remaining million of the Power Program Appropriation Investment. 
 
 TVA paid the U.S. Treasury million, million, and million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, as a return on the Power Program Appropriation Investment. The amount of the return on the Power Program Appropriation Investment is based on the Power Program Appropriation Investment balance at the beginning of that year and the computed average interest rate payable by the U.S. Treasury on its total marketable public obligations at the same date. The interest rates payable by TVA on the Power Program Appropriation Investment were percent, percent, and percent for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 
 
 TVA also has access to a financing arrangement with the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the TVA Act. TVA and the U.S. Treasury entered into a memorandum of understanding under which the U.S. Treasury provides TVA with a million credit facility. This credit facility has a maturity date of September 30, 2025, and is typically renewed annually. Access to this credit facility or other similar financing arrangements has been available to TVA since the 1960s. See Note 14 Debt and Other Obligations Credit Facility Agreements.

 million construction management agreement and lease financing arrangement with Johnsonville Aeroderivative Combustion Turbine Generation LLC ("JACTG") for the completion and lease by TVA of the Johnsonville Aeroderivative Combustion Turbine Facility ("Johnsonville Facility"). JACTG is a special single-purpose limited liability company formed in September 2024 to finance the Johnsonville Facility through a million secured note issuance (the "JACTG notes") and the issuance of million of membership interests subject to mandatory redemption. The membership interests were purchased by Johnsonville Holdco LLC ("JHLLC"). JHLLC is a special single-purpose entity, also formed in September 2024, established to acquire and hold the membership interests in JACTG. A non-controlling interest in JHLLC is held by a third-party through nominal membership interests, to which none of the income, expenses, and cash flows are allocated. 
 
 The membership interests held by JHLLC in JACTG were purchased with proceeds from the issuance of million of secured notes (the "JHLLC notes") and are subject to mandatory redemption pursuant to a schedule of amortizing, semi-annual payments due each April 1st and October 1st, with a final payment due in October 2054. The payment dates for the mandatorily redeemable membership interests are the same as those of the JHLLC notes. The sale of the JACTG notes, the membership interests in JACTG, and the JHLLC notes closed in October 2024. The JACTG notes are secured by TVA's lease payments, and the JHLLC notes are secured by JHLLC's investment in, and amounts receivable from, JACTG. TVA's lease payments to JACTG are equal to and payable on the same dates as JACTG's and JHLLC's semi-annual debt service payments. In addition to the lease payments, TVA pays administrative and miscellaneous expenses incurred by JACTG and JHLLC. Certain agreements related to this transaction contain default and acceleration provisions.

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tennessee Valley Authority (the Company) as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in proprietary capital and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 13, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit, Risk, and Cybersecurity Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Valuation of Pension Benefit Obligation Description of the Matter At September 30, 2024, the Company s pension benefit obligation was 11.0 billion. The Company utilizes certain actuarial assumptions to measure the pension benefit obligation at September 30, as more fully described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Auditing the pension benefit obligation was complex due to the judgmental nature of the assumptions used in the Company s measurement process, including the discount rates, mortality rates, and cost of living adjustments. These assumptions have a significant effect on the projected pension benefit obligation. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the pension benefit obligation valuation process. For example, we tested controls over management s review of the pension benefit obligation calculation, the relevant data inputs, and the significant actuarial assumptions described above. 
 161 

Table of Contents 

 To test the valuation of the pension benefit obligation, our audit procedures included, with the assistance of actuarial specialists, evaluating the methodologies used, the significant actuarial assumptions described above, and the underlying data used by the Company, among other procedures. We evaluated the Company s methodology for determining the discount rates that reflect the maturity and duration of the benefit payments and that are used to estimate the pension benefit obligation. To evaluate the mortality rates and cost of living adjustments, we assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available information, and whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments was applied. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data, used in the determination of the projected pension benefit obligation. Valuation of Alternative Investments Description of the Matter At September 30, 2024, the Company had 5.0 billion in investment funds and 8.7 billion in plan investments related to the defined benefit pension plan. Approximately 54 and 62 of investment funds and plan investments, respectively, are invested in private equity funds, private real asset funds, private credit funds, and commingled funds. These types of investments are referred to as alternative investments. These alternative investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value (or its equivalent) as more fully described in Note 16, for investment funds, and Note 20, for plan investments, to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Auditing the valuation of alternative investments was challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty of the inputs to the fair value measurements, including the underlying net asset values, discounted cash flow valuations, comparable market valuations, estimated benchmark yields, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity, and other risks. Additionally, certain information regarding the fair value of these alternative investments was based on unaudited information available to management at the time of valuation. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s alternative investments valuation process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the alternative investment valuation, which included a comparison of returns to benchmarks and monitoring of investment managers valuation policies and procedures, as well as portfolio performance. 
 
 To test the valuation of the alternative investments, our audit procedures included, among others, comparing fund returns to selected relevant benchmarks and understanding variations as well as comparing fair values from the most recent audited financial statements to the Company's estimated fair values. We obtained an understanding of the changes to the investment portfolio and changes in investment strategies. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual fair values to previous estimates. We evaluated for contrary evidence by confirming the fair values of the investments and ownership interest directly with the trustee and with a sample of investment managers. 
 
 Valuation of Non-Nuclear Asset Retirement Obligations Description of the Matter At September 30, 2024, the Company s non-nuclear asset retirement obligations (ARO) totaled 7.0 billion. As more fully described in Note 1 and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s initial obligation associated with the retirement of non-nuclear generating sites, ash impoundments, transmission substation and distribution assets, and certain general facilities is recognized at fair value at the time the obligation is incurred using various judgments and assumptions. Revisions to the obligation are made whenever factors indicate that the timing or amounts of estimated cash flows have changed materially. 
 
 Auditing the valuation of non-nuclear ARO was challenging because of the judgmental nature of the assumptions used in the Company s measurement process. In particular, the obligation s fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow technique which includes significant estimation and assumptions, including estimates of the costs of decommissioning, the method of decommissioning, and the timing of related cash flows.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 TVA maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by TVA in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to TVA's management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. TVA's management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Strategy Officer, and members of the Disclosure Control Committee, including the Vice President and Controller (Principal Accounting Officer) (collectively "management"), evaluated the effectiveness of TVA's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that TVA's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 (a) Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 TVA's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. TVA's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, internal control over financial reporting and systems may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
 
 TVA's management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Strategy Officer, and members of the Disclosure Control Committee, including the Vice President and Controller (Principal Accounting Officer), evaluated the design and effectiveness of TVA's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, TVA's management concluded that TVA's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Although the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was not required to be subject to attestation by TVA's independent registered public accounting firm, TVA has chosen to obtain such a report. Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on TVA's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in TVA's internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, TVA's internal control over financial reporting.

 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited Tennessee Valley Authority s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Tennessee Valley Authority (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the COSO criteria . 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in proprietary capital and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November 13, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 PART III 

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

Directors 
 
 The Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, as amended (the "TVA Act") provides that the Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") will be administered by a board of nine part-time members appointed by the President of the United States ("U.S.") with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. The Chair of the TVA Board of Directors ("TVA Board") is selected by the members of the TVA Board. Under the TVA Act, to be eligible to be appointed as a member of the TVA Board, an individual (i) must be a U.S. citizen; (ii) must have management expertise relative to a large for-profit or nonprofit corporate, government, or academic structure; (iii) cannot be a TVA employee; (iv) must make a full disclosure to Congress of any investment or other financial interest that the individual holds in the energy industry; and (v) must affirm support for the objectives and missions of TVA, including being a national leader in technological innovation, low-cost power, and environmental stewardship. In addition, the President of the U.S., in appointing members of the TVA Board, must (i) consider recommendations from other public officials such as the Governors of the states in TVA's service area; individual citizens; business, industrial, labor, electric power distribution, environmental, civic, and service organizations; and the congressional delegations of the states in TVA's service area; and (ii) seek qualified members from among persons who reflect the diversity, including geographical diversity, and needs of TVA's service area. At least seven of the nine TVA Board members must be legal residents of the TVA service area. Currently, TVA has eight active TVA Board members. 
 
 TVA Board members serve five-year terms, and at least one member's term ends each year. After a member's term ends, the member is permitted under the TVA Act to remain in office until the earlier of the end of the then-current session of Congress or the date a successor takes office. The TVA Board, among other things, establishes broad goals, objectives, and policies for TVA; develops long-range plans to guide TVA in achieving these goals, objectives, and policies; approves annual budgets; and establishes a compensation plan for employees.

The Financial Ethics Code includes provisions covering conflicts of interest, ethical conduct, compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, responsibility for full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosures, and accountability for adherence to the Financial Ethics Code. TVA will provide a current copy of the Financial Ethics Code to any person, without charge, upon request. Requests may be made by calling 888-882-4975 or by sending an e-mail to: investor@tva.com.

 Insider Trading Policy 
 
 TVA has an Insider Trading Policy that provides guidelines with respect to transactions in TVA securities by insiders and the handling of confidential information about TVA and the companies with which TVA engages in transactions or does business. The policy promotes compliance with U.S. federal, state, and foreign securities laws that prohibit certain persons who are aware of material nonpublic information relating to TVA from (1) purchasing, selling, or otherwise engaging in transactions in TVA securities, or (2) providing material nonpublic information to other persons who may trade on the basis of that information. The prohibitions against insider trading apply to trading or otherwise transacting in TVA securities, tipping, and making recommendations to engage in transactions in TVA securities by virtually any person, including all persons associated with TVA, if the information involved is material and nonpublic. In addition, the prohibitions against insider trading extend to transactions in the securities of other companies with which TVA does business or has a business relationship if the transactions are based on material nonpublic information gained while working for TVA. 

Committees of the TVA Board 
 
 The TVA Board has an Audit, Risk, and Cybersecurity Committee established in accordance with the TVA Act. This committee oversees TVA's financial reporting, risk management, cybersecurity, compliance, and ethics. It also reviews and considers input from the TVA Inspector General to ensure TVA investigates and reports transparently about its financial and legal obligations. Current members include L. Michelle Moore (Chair), Beth P. Geer, and William J. Renick. As discussed above, TVA directors are appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate, and none of the current Board members meet the requirements of being an audit committee financial expert under applicable SEC rules. 
 
 TVA is exempted by Section 37 of the Exchange Act from complying with Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act, which requires each member of a listed issuer's audit committee to be an independent member of the board of directors of the issuer. The TVA Act contains certain provisions that are similar to the considerations for independence under Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act, including that to be eligible for appointment to the TVA Board, an individual shall not be an employee of TVA and shall make full disclosure to Congress of any investment or other financial interest that the individual holds in the energy industry. 
 
 Under Section 10A(m)(2) of the Exchange Act, which applies to TVA, the audit committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the external auditor; however, the TVA Act assigns the responsibility for engaging the services of the external auditor to the TVA Board. 
 
 The TVA Board has also established four committees in addition to the Audit, Risk, and Cybersecurity Committee, as explained below: 
 
 The External Stakeholders and Regulation Committee oversees relationships with customers, members of the public, and key stakeholders. Involvement includes TVA's regulatory policy, natural resource management, economic development, government relations, federal advisory councils, and emerging social issues. Current members include Beth H. Harwell (Chair), Beth P. Greer, and William J. Renick. 
 
 The Operations and Nuclear Oversight Committee helps ensure the safety and effectiveness of TVA's power system generation and transmission assets by overseeing operational performance and planning. Additional oversight includes significant projects, major inspections and evaluations, long-term asset planning, and operational and regulatory compliance. Current members include Robert P. Klein (Chair), L. Michelle Moore, and A. Wade White. 
 
 The People and Governance Committee has a primary focus on people and the creation of a culture that lives up to TVA's values and seeks to ensure optimal performance and sustainability of the enterprise. The committee reviews key components of the people framework such as inclusion with diversity, talent, engagement, total rewards, and labor relations. Another key function of this committee is Board governance. Current members include Brian E. Noland (Chair), Beth H. Harwell, Robert P. Klein, and Joe H. Ritch. 
 
 The Finance, Rates, and Portfolio Committee oversees electricity rates, annual budget, major contracts, energy resource portfolio planning, commercial programs and products, technology, innovation, and research programs. This committee is charged with the responsibility of assisting the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to manage financial health, strategic planning, wholesale and direct-served customer rates, and holistic asset strategy. Current members include A. Wade White (Chair), Brian E. Noland, William J. Renick, and Joe H. Ritch.

 ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 
 Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
 This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD A") provides information on the objectives, goals, and structure of TVA's executive compensation program and the 2024 compensation awarded to TVA's CEO, CFSO, and the three other most highly compensated executive officers serving at the end of 2024. Collectively, these officers are TVA's 2024 Named Executive Officers ("NEOs"): 
 NEO Title Employment Date Position Date Jeffrey J. Lyash President and Chief Executive Officer 2019 2019 John M. Thomas, III Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Strategy Officer

 2021 2021 David B. Fountain Executive Vice President and General Counsel 
 2020 2021 Timothy S. Rausch Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer 
 2018 2020 
 Note 
 Mr. Thomas was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Strategy Officer ("CFSO") in June 2021 and has held the Chief Financial Officer position since June 2010. 
 TVA's Executive Compensation Philosophy 
 TVA has a public mission - one that is uniquely focused on serving the people of the Tennessee Valley and making those lives better. TVA aims to achieve its mission by attracting, retaining, and motivating highly qualified and committed executives to guide the organization's strategy, performance, and public power mission. Given the nature and scale of its operations, TVA competes with large investor-owned utilities ("IOUs") to attract and retain talent. 
 
 To effectively fulfill its public power mission, TVA must provide market-based, competitive compensation levels to drive superior performance and execution of ambitious multi-year objectives aligned with TVA's public power mission. 
 
 TVA s Compensation Plan as adopted by the TVA Board is designed to: 
 
 Align compensation with TVA performance and productivity improvement . 
 Set performance goals that are aligned with TVA's strategic priorities - See 2024 Performance Goals and Performance Achievements. 
 Provide market-based, competitive compensation levels so TVA can attract, retain, and motivate highly competent employees. Total direct compensation ("TDC"), which includes annual cash and short- and long-term incentives, generally is set by considering several factors, including reference to the median (50th percentile) of the relevant labor market, as well as factors such as individual performance, experience, and internal equity. Executives may be positioned above or below the median based on labor market conditions and other factors such as tenure in the role. See Compensation Setting Process - Establishing Competitive Compensation - Use of Market Data and Benchmarking for a discussion of benchmarking practices and competitive compensation decisions at TVA. 
 Motivate and reward short-term and long-term performance by providing a mix of salary and performance-based short-term and long-term incentives, typically targeting a majority portion of long-term compensation in the form of at-risk, performance-based compensation. 
 
 The TVA Board follows the requirements of the TVA Act, which includes the approval of a compensation plan and other notable considerations: 
 
 Compensation will be based on an annual survey of benchmark compensation for similar positions in private industry, including engineering and electric energy companies, publicly owned electric companies, and federal, state, and local governments; and 
 Compensation will take into account education, experience, level of responsibility, geographic differences, and retention and recruitment needs.

 Notable 2024 Actions 
 The following are key compensation actions and plan amendments for 2024: 
 
 TVA Executive Severance Plan 
 
 On January 26, 2024, TVA s Executive Severance Plan ("Severance Plan") was amended and restated to eliminate the additional severance benefits available to NEOs and other participants in connection with a change in control of TVA. Following a review by the People and Governance Committee (the "Committee") and the TVA Board, it was determined that TVA's Severance Plan did not need to include change in control provisions to remain competitive with its peers, based on factors unique to TVA's public power model. 
 
 Compensation Board Practice, TVA Compensation Plan, and Supplemental Plans 
 
 On May 9, 2024, the TVA Board adopted the TVA Employee Compensation Board Practice Board Practice to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the TVA Board, the Committee, and management with respect to compensation matters. In addition, the TVA Board approved amended and restated versions of the TVA Compensation Plan and the following supplemental compensation plans to, among other things, reflect the principles set forth in the Board Practice: (1) Executive Annual Incentive Plan EAIP ), (2) Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP ), (3) Severance Plan, (4) Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, (5) Deferred Compensation Plan, and (6) Restoration Plan. 
 
 Three of the above supplemental plans (EAIP, LTIP, and Severance Plan) were amended and restated to reduce the amounts that TVA s CEO may receive under these plans. 
 
 Under both incentive plans (EAIP and LTIP), the potential maximum earned payout achievement was reduced from 200 percent to 150 percent of the CEO's target opportunity. 
 Under the Severance Plan, the CEO's cash severance was reduced as a result of a change in the cash severance formula from (1) 1.5 times the sum of the CEO's salary and target EAIP to (2) 1.0 times the CEO's salary. 
 
 The above changes are a cumulative result of specific recommendations presented to the Committee by the Executive Compensation Task Force ("ECTF"), which was created in December 2023 and consisted of a subset of members of the TVA Board. The ECTF focused its review and subsequent recommendations on Board governance and oversight with respect to executive compensation, CEO participation in TVA plans, and management's process for communicating compensation matters to the Committee and Board regarding CEO payouts under TVA plans. The Committee believes the above changes are appropriate in light of TVA's public service mission. 
 
 Amendment to Compensation Board Practice 
 
 On August 22, 2024, the TVA Board approved amendments to the Board Practice adopted on May 9, 2024, to allow the CEO to approve compensation of his or her executive direct reports within ranges of total compensation that are approved annually by the Chair of the Committee. These amendments are designed to ensure that the TVA Board, through the Chair of the Committee, maintains appropriate oversight while allowing the CEO flexibility to implement his or her own compensation decisions. 
 
 TVA Board Actions Related to Compensation 
 
 On September 17, 2024, the TVA Board (1) established 2024 EAIP performance measures and goals for the CEO, (2) established 2025 corporate performance measures and goals for the Enterprise Scorecard for the Winning Performance Team Incentive Plan WPTIP and EAIP, (3) established performance measures and goals for the 2024-2026 and 2025-2027 performance cycles under the LTIP, and (4) approved amendments to the WPTIP and EAIP that would eliminate the use of the corporate multiplier and would authorize the TVA Board to utilize a standard discretionary range to adjust the scorecard achievement by plus or minus 20 percent beginning with the 2025 performance cycle. This standard discretionary range allows the TVA Board to account for extraordinary events or significant occurrences that impact TVA's performance.

 TVA's Executive Compensation Program Aligns Pay with Performance 
 
 Two-thirds of the CEO's target TDC is performance-based and at risk, based on achievement of performance goals that further advance TVA's mission and strategic objectives. More than half of the other NEOs' target TDC opportunity is performance-based and at risk. This alignment of compensation with performance also results in compensation being aligned with value delivered to TVA's stakeholders, including LPCs, businesses, and communities, and to the economy of the Tennessee Valley. 

Compensation Setting Process 
 Establishing Compensation and Governance Practices 
 The TVA Board, under the authority of the TVA Act, has responsibility for establishing compensation for TVA employees, including the NEOs. The TVA Board is directed under Section 2 of the TVA Act to establish a plan that specifies all compensation (such as salary and any other pay, benefits, incentives, or other form of remuneration) for the CEO and TVA employees. The TVA Act also provides that the TVA Board will annually approve all compensation (such as salary and any other pay, benefits, incentives, or other forms of remuneration) for all managers and technical personnel who report directly to the CEO (including any adjustments to compensation). 
 
 Under the authority of the TVA Act, the TVA Board, its Committee, and individual TVA Board members are all involved in compensation matters. The TVA Board has taken the following actions to delegate authority with respect to compensation: 
 
 Delegation to Committee 
 
 Oversee executive compensation pursuant to the Compensation Plan. 
 
 Review this CD A and recommend approval to the TVA Board. 
 
 Review and make critical recommendations to the TVA Board, as reflected in Compensation Setting Process - Compensation Setting - Annual Roles and Responsibility. 
 
 Delegation to TVA Committee Chair 
 
 Establish annual performance goals of the CEO, with concurrence of the TVA Board Chair and input from other members of the TVA Board, as appropriate. 
 
 Determine the CEO s annual performance rating in accordance with the approved goals, with concurrence of the TVA B oard Chair and input from other members of the TVA Board, as appropriate.

Establishing Competitive Compensation 
 A fundamental goal of TVA's executive compensation program is to attract, retain, and motivate the highly competent talent necessary to manage TVA's complex operations and achieve superior performance. TVA competes for this talent with large IOUs, and thus TVA needs to offer compensation programs that are competitive with those peers. 
 Use of Market Data and Benchmarking 
 TVA generally determines target TDC for executives considering the median of the relevant labor market as well as other factors such as individual performance, experience, and internal equity. 
 
 After compiling market compensation for the positions at the beginning of 2024 , the Committee, with assistance from FW Cook, used the information to: 
 
 Assess target compensation level and incentive opportunity competitiveness; and 
 Determine appropriate target compensation levels and incentive opportunities to maintain the desired degree of market competitiveness. 
 
 The relevant labor market for most of TVA's executives, including the NEOs, consists of both private and publicly-owned companies in the energy services industry that have similar revenue and scope as TVA. The process for gathering and analyzing information about executive compensation in the relevant labor market is as follows: 
 
 Each year, the Committee's compensation consultant recommends a relevant labor market peer group for approval by the Committee. For 2024 compensation opportunities, TVA's market data was determined based on a review of executive compensation survey data and/or public proxy statement data for members of this peer group. 
 For the survey-based analysis, TVA referenced a sample from the 2023 Willis Towers Watson ("WTW") Energy Services Executive Compensation Database consisting of (1) 33 IOUs with revenue greater than or equal to 3.0 billion plus (2) 11 additional government/non-profit entities with revenue greater than or equal to 1.0 billion. Data from this sample were further regressed to TVA's size based on revenue. 
 The survey analysis was supplemented with public compensation data from a separate proxy peer group of IOUs. The Committee reviews the proxy peers annually to ensure continued appropriateness, including comparable business content and model, company size measured primarily by revenue and assets, and other refining factors such as generating capacity, number of employees, and number of customers.

 Assessment of Risk 
 TVA's Enterprise Risk Management organization, in coordination with other members of TVA's management, including Human Resources, conducts an annual assessment of enterprise-level risks including risks arising from TVA's compensation policies and practices. 
 
 Based on the results of this assessment, no risks were identified with the compensation policies and practices that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the organization and its achievement of its strategic goals and objectives. 
 2024 Executive Compensation Program Components 
 Total Direct Compensation ("TDC") 
 In setting executive compensation each year, the Committee focuses on TDC, which includes those compensation elements that motivate future performance or reward past performance. TDC is comprised of annual salary, an annual incentive award under TVA s EAIP, and an LTI award provided under TVA s LTIP, which is delivered in two components, a Long-Term Performance LTP award and a Long-Term Retention LTR award. 
 
 Each year, two key compensation decisions are made with respect to NEO compensation: (1) the amount of the TDC opportunity to grant, which is forward-looking, incentivizes the NEO to perform, and is determined toward the beginning of the fiscal year, and (2) the amount of TDC earned, which rewards the NEO for demonstrated performance (other than salary or LTR award) and is determined at the end of the fiscal year. The TDC components and weightings for TDC opportunities granted to the NEOs in 2024 are summarized below and described in the sections that follow. Since TVA is a governmental entity that issues no equity, all direct compensation is denominated and paid out in cash. 
 178 

Table of Contents 

 Compensation Component And of Target TDC Objective Key Features Annual Salary 
 
 Provide fixed base compensation to encourage hiring and retention of qualified executives 
 Annual salary is typically determined by considering, among other things, the median (50th percentile) for similar positions at other companies in TVA's peer group; above the median for positions affected by market scarcity, recruitment and retention issues, and other business reasons; or below median due to incumbent experience, position scope, or other business reasons. 
 
 Executive Annual Incentive Plan (EAIP) 
 
 Incentivize performance by providing at-risk compensation tied to attainment of pre-established performance goals for the fiscal year Annual incentive payouts are based on the results of enterprise goals as determined from year to year by the TVA Board or the CEO, as applicable. Annual incentive payouts may be impacted by a corporate multiplier or adjusted by the TVA Board or CEO, as applicable, based on the evaluation of performance during the year. 
 Target annual incentive opportunities increase with position and responsibility and are based in part on the opportunities other companies in TVA's peer group provide to those in similar positions. 
 
 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
 Provide a targeted level of total long-term compensation comprised of at-risk and retention components Participation is limited to key positions that have the ability to significantly impact the long-term financial and/or operational objectives critical to TVA's overall success. 
 Long-Term Performance Award (LTP) 
 
 Incentivize performance by providing at-risk compensation tied to attainment of pre-established performance goals over a three-year performance period LTP grants have a three-year performance cycle with variable at-risk opportunities based on achievement against performance goals established at the beginning of the performance cycle. 
 The Committee's policy is for a majority of each executive's total LTI opportunity to be in the form of performance-based grant, with the remaining percent to be retention oriented. 
 Long-Term Retention Award (LTR) 
 
 Incentivize retention by providing "fixed" retention-based grants tied to a three-year vesting schedule LTR grants will vest and pay out in three equal increments annually over three years, subject to the participant being employed through such dates, but are payable upon death, disability, or retirement if earlier on a pro-rated basis. 
 Since TVA issues no equity, TVA offers retention grants to be competitive with the industry marketplace for talent, providing a retention incentive similar to restricted stock or restricted stock units. These grants are intended to encourage executives to remain with TVA and to provide, in combination with salary, EAIP, and LTP grants, a competitive level of TDC.

 (1) All salaries were effective October 1, 2023. 

179 

Table of Contents 

 The 2024 salaries for the NEOs are reported in the Executive Compensation Tables and Narrative Disclosures - Summary Compensation Table . 
 Incentive Opportunities 
 The short- and long-term incentive opportunities for the NEOs are set at levels that (1) are competitive with the relevant labor market, with target TDC generally determined by considering the 50th percentile of the relevant labor market, and (2) result in a majority of each executive's total LTI opportunity in the form of performance-based awards and the remaining percent of each executive's total LTI opportunity in the form of retention awards. More than half of TVA's NEO's target TDC opportunity is performance-based and at-risk as described above in TVA's Executive Compensation Program Aligns Pay with Performance . 
 LTI awards are intended to provide a similar pay component as equity-based compensation at peer IOUs. Since TVA does not issue equity, the compensation program cannot provide a component similar to equity awards that capture long-term value, and have the potential for significant gains or losses, based on market fluctuations. As a result, TVA's LTIs are not necessarily intended to match market pay levels. 
 Target incentive opportunities increase with position scope and responsibility to hold management accountable for delivery of results and are based in part on the opportunities other companies in TVA's peer group provide to those in similar positions. Incentive opportunities are typically reviewed annually to consider changes in benchmark short- and long-term incentives. The Committee reviews peer benchmark information by position for each component of pay as well as for overall TDC. 
 Non-Direct Compensation Elements 
 Other Compensation 
 To recruit high-quality talent, TVA may offer recruitment awards as well as relocation assistance and reimbursement. These types of deferred cash incentive awards are intended to compensate the individuals for amounts they may have forfeited from their previous employer in order to join TVA and/or provide substitute compensation when the individual is not eligible to receive certain incentive payments until a future date. 
 Executive Severance Plan 
 TVA has established a Severance Plan to provide additional benefits to certain executives if TVA terminates the employment of covered executives other than for Gross Misconduct or such executives terminate for Good Reason. See Executive Compensation Tables and Narrative Disclosures - Executive Severance Plan below for additional information regarding the benefits available to covered executives under the Severance Plan as well as definitions of Gross Misconduct and Good Reason. Material changes in the Severance Plan were approved for 2024 , as reflected above in Notable 2024 Actions . 
 Retirement Benefits 
 TVA provides its NEOs with retirement benefits through its qualified plans as well as through a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan ("SERP") in order to provide compensation beginning with retirement or termination of employment (if vesting requirements are satisfied), with enhanced compensation for certain executives to provide an additional incentive for hiring and retention of qualified individuals. 
 TVA sponsors a qualified defined benefit plan ("pension plan") and a qualified defined contribution plan ("401(k) plan"), which are administered by the TVA Retirement System ("TVARS"). The availability of, and level of benefits provided by, these qualified plans are comparable to similar qualified plans provided by companies in TVA's peer group. 
 In addition to its qualified retirement plans, TVA has a SERP for selected executives who are critical to the ongoing success of the enterprise. TVA's SERP is a non-qualified plan that provides supplemental retirement benefits at compensation levels that are higher than the limits specified by Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") regulations for qualified retirement plans. The provision of such non-qualified plans to executives is a common practice among companies in TVA's peer group. The purpose of the SERP is to: 
 Provide a competitive retirement benefit level that cannot be delivered solely through TVA's qualified retirement plans due to IRS limitations, and 
 Provide a benefit level (as a percentage replacement of pre-retirement pay) that is more comparable to that of employees who are not subject to the IRS limitations. 
 More information regarding these retirement benefits is found following the Pension Benefits Table. 
 Health and Other Benefits 
 TVA offers a group of health and other benefits (medical, dental, vision, life and accidental death and disability insurance, and long-term disability insurance) that are available to a broad group of employees. The NEOs are eligible to participate in TVA's 
 180 

Table of Contents 

 health benefit plans and other non-retirement benefit plans on the same terms and at the same contribution rates as other TVA employees. 
 
 2024 Performance Goals and Performance Achievement Strategic Priorities Incentive Compensation Measures A significant portion of each NEO's compensation is based on company performance and influenced by individual performance achievements. As a result, a majority of NEO compensation is at-risk, providing incentive for the executive to achieve superior performance for TVA and for the businesses, communities, and residents it serves, both in the short term and in the years to come. 
 Incentive compensation is provided to NEOs under the EAIP and LTIP. Each incentive award is described below.

 Incentive compensation measures align with strategic priorities and are further described below in Executive Annual Incentive Plan ("EAIP") - 2024 EAIP Performance Measures and Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") . 
 Executive Annual Incentive Plan ("EAIP") 
 All TVA employees (including NEOs) participate in an annual, short-term incentive program (subject to eligibility requirements), since every employee contributes to the success of TVA and the execution of its public power mission. While the measures used for annual incentives are the same for all employees, they are provided under two plans: the WPTIP provides for annual incentive awards for eligible non-executives, and the EAIP provides for annual incentive awards for eligible executives, including the NEOs. 
 The EAIP is designed to encourage and reward executives for successfully achieving annual financial and operational goals. For 2024 , the annual incentive payment for each NEO other than the CEO was calculated as follows: 
 
 EAIP Amount = Annual Salary Annual Target Incentive Opportunity Percent of Enterprise Scorecard Opportunity Achieved (0 to 200 Corporate Multiplier (0 to 1.1) Individual Performance Multiplier (0 to 150 
 The EAIP award for the CEO was calculated in the same manner as those awards for other NEOs except that the Scorecard Achievement range measured from 0 percent to 150 percent instead of 0 percent to 200 percent. See Notable 2024 Actions for additional information regarding this change. 
 Each component of this calculation is discussed below (except for annual salary, which is discussed above). The award for certain participants in the EAIP may be adjusted by the participant's supervisor based on an evaluation of the participant's individual achievements and performance during the year. In addition, pursuant to discretion granted under the TVA 
 181 

Table of Contents 

 Compensation Plan and EAIP, awards may be further adjusted by the TVA Board in its discretion. There is no guaranteed minimum payout under the EAIP, and the maximum payout for the EAIP cannot exceed 225 percent of the target award for all participants other than the CEO. For the CEO, the maximum payout cannot exceed 150 percent of the target award. 
 
 EAIP Target Incentive Opportunity 
 Following a review of benchmarking and individual performance, the TVA Board evaluated the appropriateness of the EAIP award opportunity for the CEO based on market data and other individual factors and made no changes for 2024. Similarly, the CEO evaluated the appropriateness of the EAIP award opportunities for the other NEOs based on market data and other individual factors, including internal parity, and made no changes for 2024. Accordingly, target EAIP award opportunities of the NEOs for 2024 were as follows: 
 NEO 2024 EAIP

 2024 EAIP Performance Measures 
 EAIP performance measures tie directly to key enterprise metrics used by senior management in TVA's annual budget and strategic planning process, which in turn link directly to the achievement of TVA's mission and strategic priorities. The 2024 EAIP performance measures and goals were provided in an organizational scorecard ("TVA Enterprise Scorecard"). The 2024 performance measures, along with the weighting ascribed to each, are shown below as a percentage of the total EAIP award opportunity at target-level performance. 
 2024 EAIP PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
 
 The 2024 WPTIP/EAIP measures are described in detail below. 
 TVA Total Spend 
 What this measures: TVA's ability to keep costs low 
 Total Non-Fuel Operating and Maintenance, Capital, Non-Fuel Inventory, and Cloud Implementation expenses for corporate and operational Strategic Business Unit organizations (excludes TVA Board of Directors). 
 Why Is This Metric Used? 
 Supports the overall TVA goal of maintaining costs and managing rates based on spending levels approved by TVA management and the TVA Board. 
 
 Load Not Served 
 What this measures: Transmission system outages that affect TVA customers 
 Load Not Served ("LNS") is a measure of the magnitude and duration of transmission system outages that affect TVA customers expressed in system minutes. An automatic customer interruption with a duration of one minute or greater is tracked as an LNS event. LNS events caused by TVA on a distributor system will also count as a TVA event even if the TVA system remains energized. LNS events exclude interruptions due to declared major events, variances, verified tornadoes, gunfire, vandalism, ice formation, and foreign object/vehicle. 
 Why Is This Metric Used? 
 TVA manages this critical indicator to reduce the impact of customer outages. 

Annualized Nuclear Online Reliability Loss Factor 
 What this measures: Nuclear plant availability 
 Annualized Nuclear Online Reliability Loss Factor is the 12-month ratio of all generation losses (minus refueling outage RFO and exempt losses) to reference energy generation (minus RFO and exempt losses) in a normal fuel cycle period, per external standard nuclear industry guidelines. 
 
 Why Is This Metric Used? 
 Monitors performance between refueling outages to obtain high unit and energy production reliability. 
 
 Combined Cycle Equivalent Forced Outage Rate 
 What this measures: Combined cycle plant reliability 
 Combined Cycle Equivalent Forced Outage Rate ("EFOR") measures the generation lost due to forced events as a percentage of time the unit would have been scheduled to run for TVA-operated combined cycle generating assets, based on Generating Availability Data System ("GADS") event reporting guidelines for megawatt hour losses. Combined Cycle EFOR excludes GADS events classified as outside management control and variances. 
 Why Is This Metric Used? 
 Combined Cycle EFOR focuses on ensuring TVA combined cycle generating assets are available and reliable to meet system demand. 
 
 Coal Equivalent Forced Outage Rate 
 What this measures: Coal plant reliability 
 Coal EFOR measures the generation lost due to forced events as a percentage of time the unit would have been scheduled to run for TVA-operated coal generating assets, based on GADS event reporting guidelines for megawatt hour losses. Coal EFOR excludes GADS events classified as outside management control and variances. 
 Why Is This Metric Used? 
 Coal EFOR focuses on ensuring TVA coal generating assets are available and reliable to meet system demand. 
 
 In setting the goal for each measure, consideration is given to TVA's historic performance, its strategic business plan priorities and strategic benchmarking goals, customer and stakeholder feedback, environmental and regulatory concerns and goals, and the competitive environment. Achievement of the target goal would result in a 100 percent payout with respect to that goal. A threshold goal is also set for each measure, so that no award payout would occur with respect to a measure when performance fails to achieve that threshold. Additionally, a stretch goal for each measure is set to incentivize and reward exceptional performance. Linear interpolation is used for results between threshold and stretch goals.

 2024 Enterprise Scorecard and Corporate Multiplier Results 
 The performance results on the 2024 TVA Enterprise Scorecard are set forth below. TVA's Enterprise Scorecard is based on a scale of 0 percent to 200 percent for all participants other than the CEO and resulted in a 170 percen t of ta rget opportunity payout. For the CEO, TVA's Enterprise Scorecard is based on a scale of 0 percent to 150 percent and resulted in a 127.5 percent of target opportunity payout. TVA's Corporate Multiplier (described in the following section) has been used to d etermine final payout results. 
 
 ENTERPRISE SCORECARD PERFORMANCE (1) 
 Note 
 (1) The TVA Enterprise Scorecard sets forth performance goals of annual incentive plans applicable to both executive and non-executive employees. 
 Corporate Multiplier Approval 
 As in previous years, the TVA Board approved the use of a corporate multiplier for the 2024 EAIP. The corporate multiplier ranges between 0 and 1.1 and is based on a qualitative assessment of performance in 2024 against goals set in February 2024 for six organizational performance measures. Key highlights for this performance period were: 
 Continued overall strong safety performance 
 2024 SIIR is best achievable with zero serious injuries reported for the fiscal year 
 Fina ncial health and performance continued strong financial performance with Total Financing Obligations ("TFO"), Net Income, and Operating Cash Flow substantially exceeding target 
 Jobs created and jobs retained 2024 efforts continued to help attract and encourage the expansion of business and industries 
 8.9 billion in projected investments, and 
 Expected creation/retention of 52,761 jobs (10,368 jobs created and 42,393 jobs retained) 
 Overall performance outstanding performance across a broad range of metrics 
 Why does the TVA Board 
 use a multiplier? 

The multiplier allows the TVA Board to qualitatively assess the organization's performance, emphasizing the importance of safety, financial health, reputation, and economic development. 
 
 The TVA Board qualitatively assessed TVA s performance at the end of the 2024 performance period. Based on TVA's performance with respect to the 2024 corporate multiplier measures and the overall performance described above, the TVA Board determined to apply a 1.0 multi plier to the calculated EAIP payout .

 Corporate Multiplier Factors 
 Measure Definition Why Is This Measure Used? Safety Serious Injury Incident Rate ("SIIR") A mathematical calculation used by Edison Electric Institute that quantifies the extent of injury for serious injuries and fatalities from events within the control of the employee and/or the employer. TVA shares a professional and personal commitment to protect the safety of its employees, its contractors, its customers, and those in communities that TVA serves. 
 Total Financing Obligations ("TFO") TFO includes all statutory debt and other financial obligations. TFO is calculated by subtracting unbudgeted contributions to unfunded liabilities from the sum of (1) long-term debt (including unamortized premiums/discounts), (2) short-term debt, (3) leaseback obligations, (4) energy prepayment obligations, and (5) variable interest entities. 
 TVA's TFOs are driven by its business plan and reflect the application of sound financial guiding principles. Focusing on this measure will improve TVA's fiscal performance and strengthen TVA's balance sheet. Operating Cash Flow Amount of cash generated from power production and other mission-related activities and generally defined as operating revenues received less cash payments made for operating expenses. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows f or additional information. 
 Operating Cash Flow is considered a key indicator of overall financial health as it measures TVA's ability to use cash received from customers to sufficiently fund outgoing cash expenditures. Net Income Consists of the entity s net earnings derived by adjusting revenues for the cost of doing business, including the cost of sales, depreciation, interest, taxes, and other expenses. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Consolidated Statements of Operations for additional information. 
 Net income is a standard accounting measure that provides a view of TVA's financial performance and position. Jobs Created and Jobs Retained (1) 
 Measures the number of new or retained jobs in the Tennessee Valley for which TVA has played a role in the recruitment or retention of the economic development project. Jobs Created and Retained is an industry standard measure that economic developers can speak to and easily understand, and provides an established tracking mechanism to measure TVA's economic development efforts. Board Level Significant Events Includes items deemed significant by the TVA Board of Directors. These items may affect TVA's reputation with its customers and its stakeholders, the organizational health of the workforce, or its impact on the public at large. Both favorable and unfavorable events will be considered. An incentive pay program, by design, cannot cover the entire scope of activities that could occur during a given cycle. This measure allows the TVA Board to deem certain reputational, environmental, or other items as significant impacts to TVA's bus iness. Items that may be considered significant (either favorably or unfavorably) include customer survey results, stakeholder survey results, key indicators of organizational health, environmental events, or other major events not covered in other performance measures.

 Individual Performance Multiplier Reinforces Pay for Performance 
 Annually, individual goals for the NEOs are established at the beginning of each performance cycle. These goals tie to the achievement of TVA's mission and strategic priorities. 
 At the end of the performance period, the CEO assesses the performance of the other NEOs and determines any individual multiplier, in consultation with the Committee. The CEO reviews his or her direct reports' performance with the Committee prior to finalizing end of year payouts for the CEO's direct reports, informs the Committee of any discretion under consideration, and determines final payouts after informing the Committee Chair and the Committee's independent compensation consultant. 
 
 For the CEO individual performance multiplier, each TVA Board member assesses the CEO's performance at the end of a performance period (fiscal year-end). Results of the assessment are provided to the Committee Chair who, with concurrence of the TVA Board Chair and input from other TVA Board members, determines the CEO's annual performance rating. The Committee then recommends to the full TVA Boa rd payouts to the CEO under the EAIP. For each NEO, the individual performance multiplier can range between 0 percent to 150 percent of the calculated payout and can be used to reduce (multiplier below 100 percent) or increase (multiplier above 100 percent) the amount of the award. 
 For 2024, the NEOs were evaluated on individual performance goals and the following leadership competencies:

 Notes 
 (1) This column reflects the percent of Enterprise Scorecard approved by the TVA Board. The EAIP Award for Mr. Lyash was calculated in the same manner as that of each NEO, except that his award was calibrated using a Scorecard Achievement range of 0 percent to 150 percent instead of 0 percent to 200 percent. 
 (2) The maximum EAIP payout for the CEO cannot exceed 150 percent of target. Mr. Lyash's individual performance multiplier of 100 percent was based on an evaluation of his performance during the fiscal year by the Committee and the TVA Board. 
 (3) The IPM for Mr. Thomas recognizes strong performance, with achievements at or near stretch for five key financial measures (TVA Total Spend, TFO, Operating Cash Flow, Net Income, and Non-Fuel Delivered Cost of Power). In addition, Financial Services exceeded the renewable and storage MW added metric, launched new interruptible products yielding 850 MW, and supported TVA efforts in bringing federal funding to the Valley and its stakeholders. 
 (4) The IPM for Mr. Moul recognizes operational performance above expectations, with achievements at stretch on three key operational measures. In addition, the Chief Operating Office maintained a zero SIIR for 2024 while also demonstrating year-over-year improvement in asset performance. 
 
 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") 
 TVA executives, including the NEOs, participate in the company's LTIP. These individuals make decisions that significantly influence the development and execution of TVA's long-term strategic objectives. As such, awards under TVA's LTIP are designed to reward executives for sustainable success. Since long-term success is supported by a commitment to continued employment, the NEOs are incentivized to remain with the company through the vesting of the LTP awards and LTR awards, as discussed below.

F or 2024 compensation decisions, the TVA Board and Mr. Lyash evaluated the appropriateness of the LTI award opportunities for the CEO and other NEOs, respectively. As a result, the values of the Total LTI grants (LTP awards at target and the LTR awards) were increased from 2023 levels, near market median, following a review of benchmarking and individual performance and reflective of increased tenure and experience. Accordingly, target LTI award opportunities of the NEOs for 2024 were as follows:

 LTIP Grant and Vested Awards 
 TVA's executive compensation program provides for an annual LTP grant, which yields a vested award following a three-year performance period. During 2024, there were three overlapping LTP awards: 
 2022 2024 LTP Award Vested September 30, 2024 2023 2025 LTP Award Vesting September 30, 2025 2024 2026 LTP Award Vesting September 30, 2026 
 The performance measures and threshold, target, and stretch goals for each measure are determined annually by the TVA Board. In setting the goal for each measure, the TVA Board considers budgeted amounts in the company's approved business plans, actual performance in recent years, and level of attainment. The TVA Board also considers TVA's strategic business plan priorities and strategic benchmarking goals, customer and stakeholder feedback, environmental and regulatory concerns and goals, and the competitive environment. 
 Following the TVA Board's approval of performance achievement at the end of each three-year performance period, awards are paid out in cash early in the subsequent fiscal year, or upon death, disability, or retirement, as described in TVA's LTIP. For the 2022-2024 LTP award cycle, target performance provides for a 100 percent payout opportunity, performance below threshold provides for no payout, performance at threshold provides for a 50 percent payout opportunity, and performance at stretch provides for a 200 percent payout opportunity (for all eligible participants, except the CEO). 
 
 LTP Incentive awards for the CEO are calculated in the same manner except that the scorecard achievement ranges from 0 percent to 150 percent instead of 0 percent to 200 percent (see " Notable 2024 Actions" for additional information regarding change). Linear interpolation is used for results between threshold and stretch goals. The TVA Board may apply discretion, based on consideration of corporate factors and events that are significant during the Performance Cycle but not included or captured in the performance goals and performance measures, to reduce or increase the final LTP incentive awards for any or all participants as long as the final awards do not exceed the maximum amounts described above. 
 LTP Incentive Amount = Target Value Percent of LTI Scorecard Opportunity Achieved (0 to 200 
 For the three-year performance period ended September 30, 2024, the TVA Board previously approved four overall TVA performance measures to be applied to all participants in the LTP. The 2022 2024 performance measures, along with the weighting ascribed to each, are shown below as a percentage of the total LTP award opportunity at target-level performance.

 2022-2024 LTP 
 PERFORMANCE 
 MEASURES 
 
 The 2022 2024 LTP measures are described in detail below. 
 Non-Fuel Delivered Cost of Power 
 What this measures: non-fuel expenses (cents/kWh) 
 The Non-Fuel Delivered Cost of Power is a financial measure equal to the sum of (1) non-fuel operating and maintenance ("O M") expense, (2) base capital cost, (3) interest expense, and (4) other expense divided by budgeted electric power sales. 
 Why Is This Measure Used? 
 This measure drives performance through activities that management can control. It aligns with TVA's strategic objective of maintaining low rates and focuses on aligning TVA s non-fuel costs associated with generation, transmission, statutory mission services, and additional customer services with revenue. Non-Fuel Delivered Cost of Power supports retail rate objectives and aligns to the business plan commitment. 

Load Not Served 
 What this measures: transmission system outages that affect TVA customers 
 Load Not Served ("LNS") is a measure of the magnitude and duration of transmission system outages that affect TVA customers expressed in system minutes. An automatic customer interruption with a duration of one minute or greater is tracked as an LNS event. LNS events caused by TVA on a distributor system will also count as a TVA event even if the TVA system remains energized. LNS excludes interruptions due to declared major events, variances, gunfire, vandalism, and verified tornadoes. 
 Why Is This Measure Used? 
 TVA manages this critical indicator to reduce the impact of customer outages. 
 
 External Performance Indicators for the TVA Nuclear Fleet 
 What this measures: nuclear operations performance 
 External Performance Indicators for the TVA Nuclear Fleet is calculated using a weighted combination of key performance indicators based on standard nuclear industry definitions for station performance, with the maximum obtainable being 100 points. TVA's fleet level index is a simple average of unit performance. 
 Why Is This Measure Used? 
 This measure is a recognized industry standard for nuclear operations performance based on safety and reliability. 
 
 Powerful Partnerships Survey 
 What this measures: external perception and reputational events 
 Powerful Partnerships Survey is conducted among customers, elected officials, business/economic development leaders, and the general public in the TVA service area to assess strength of various stakeholder relationships with TVA. 
 
 Why Is This Measure Used? 
 This measure supports the effective management of TVA's reputation and the ability to achieve desired outcomes and deliver on strategic priorities with stakeholders. 
 
 190 

Table of Contents 

 Consistent with its public power mission, TVA's LTP measures include the results of surveys that assess the external reputation and perception of TVA and TVA's effectiveness in carrying out its mission and strategic objectives. These measures reflect TVA's focus on meeting or exceeding customer expectations and identifying areas for continuous improvement. 
 2022 2024 LTP Award Performance Results 
 The performance results under the 2022-2024 TVA Long-Term Performance Scorecard are set forth below. TVA's LTP Scorecard is based on a range of 0 percent to 200 percent for all participants other than the CEO and resulted in a payout of 143 percent of target opportunity. For the CEO, TVA's LTP Scorecard is based on a scale of 0 percent to 150 percent, and resulted in an adjusted payout of 82 p ercent of target oppor tunity. 
 
 Notes 
 (1) Non-Fuel Delivered Cost of Power = (Non-Fuel Operating and Maintenance Expense + Base Capital Cost + Interest Expense + Other Expense) / Budgeted Electric Power Sales. For the 2022 2024 performance cycle, the Non-Fuel Delivered Cost of Power measure was calculated using an average of the 2022, 2023, and 2024 results. 
 (2) Load Not Served = (Percentage of Total Load Not Served) x (Number of Minutes in the Period). For the 2022 2024 performance cycle, the Load Not Served measure was calculated using an average of the 2022, 2023, and 2024 results. 
 (3) The External Performance Indicators for TVA Nuclear Fleet measure is calculated using a weighted combination of key performance indicators based on standard nuclear industry definitions for station performance, with the maximum obtainable being 100 points. For the 2022 2024 performance cycle, the External Performance Indicators for the TVA Nuclear Fleet measure was calculated using the 2024 results. 
 (4) The Powerful Partnerships Survey is conducted among customers, elected officials, business and economic development leaders, and the general public in the TVA service area to assess the strength of various stakeholder relationships with TVA. For the 2022 2024 performance cycle, the Powerful Partnerships Survey measure was calculated using an average of the 2022, 2023, and 2024 results. 
 In reviewing the 2022 2024 performance period, the TVA Board considered strong performance in two areas along with below threshold performance for External Performance Indicators for the TVA Nuclear Fleet and slightly below target performance for Powerful Partnerships Survey in 2024. Below are key highlights for this performance period:

 In light of operational performance challenges during the three-year performance cycle of the LTIP and concerns regarding TVA's ability to manage costs in light of future financial needs, the TVA Board exercised discretion to adjust the calculated 2022-2024 LTP Award payout from 114 percent to 82 percent , which is 72 percent of the calculated payout, for Mr. Lyash. For the remaining participants other than the CEO, the TVA Board determined that the calculated payout appropriately reflected executive performance in executing on TVA's long-term priorities and did not exercise its discretion to adjust the calculated payout. Award payouts for NEOs are reported below and in the Executive Compensation Tables and Narrative Disclosures Summary Compensation Table under "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation."

 (2) Carbon-Free Performance Indicator measures renewable megawatts ("MW") added to the TVA system, energy program savings gigawatt hour ("GWh") and capacity MW provided by energy programs, and the ability to meet TVA's operational needs through demand response ("DR") event performance. This measure supports the evolution of TVA's reliability and clean energy supply into the energy system of the future as well as helps manage the impact of TVA's identified enterprise risk related to planning and execution of the power system. 
 (3) The Powerful Partnerships Survey is conducted among customers, elected officials, business/economic development leaders, and the general public in the TVA service area to assess the strength of various stakeholder relationships with TVA. This measure supports the effective management of TVA's reputation and ability to achieve desired outcomes and deliver on strategic priorities with stakeholders. 
 (4) The Stretch Payout for the CEO is 150 percent. 
 
 LTR Grant and Vested Awards 
 As a corporate agency of the U.S., TVA does not have equity securities that it can use to provide stock awards, options, or other equity-based awards as compensation for its employees. The purpose of the retention grants under the LTIP is to provide a "fixed" retention incentive similar to restricted stock or restricted stock units. These grants are intended to encourage executives to remain with TVA and to provide, in combination with salary, EAIP, and LTP grants, a competitive level of TDC. Grants are generally effective as of October 1 and will become one-third vested on each subsequent September 30 or upon death, disability, or retirement if earlier on a pro-rated basis. Each award will be paid in a lump sum within two months of vesting. 
 2024 LTR Grant 
 Following the market assessment conducted by FW Cook, effective October 1, 2023, TVA approved LTR grants to the NEOs. These grants vest in three equal tranches on September 30, 2024, September 30, 2025, and September 30, 2026, contingent upon continued employment on each vesting date. The amounts of these grants are set forth under Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") above.

 CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure 
 As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, TVA is providing the following information regarding the annual total compensation of TVA's CEO position and the annual total compensation of the median employee of the company: 
 The total compensation for the CEO position for 2024 was 10,536,962. 
 F or 2024, the median employee's annual total compensation wa s 163,779. 
 Based o n this information, the pay ratio of the total compensation for the CEO position to the median employee was approximately 64 to 1. 
 To identify the median employee and to determine the annual total compensation of the median employee, TVA took the following steps: 
 TVA selected Septemb er 30, 2024, as the date on which to identify its median employee. On September 30, 2024, TVA's employee population that had earnings in 2024 (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees) consisted of 11,267 individual s located in the U.S. 
 In order to identify the median employee from its employee population, TVA compared the compensation that would be included in Box 5 (Medicare Wages and Tips) of Form W-2, which includes salary, overtime, and incentive compensation, for the period from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Box 5 compensation was used as it is representative of the compensation received by all employees and is readily available and objective. 
 After identifying its median employee, TVA calculated that employee's compensation for 2024 as though that compensation was being calculated for purposes of the Summary Compensation Table, resulting in annual total compensation o f 163,779. 
 TVA believes that the above pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Because Item 402(u) provides companies with flexibility to select the methodology and assumptions used to identify the median employee and to calculate the pay ratio, the pay ratio reported by TVA may not be comparable to the pay ratios reported by other companies.

 Notes 
 (1) TVA does not have any equity securities and therefore has no equity-based awards. 
 (2) Threshold, Target, and Maximum represent amounts that could be earned by an NEO based on performance during the applicable performance cycle. Threshold, Target, and Maximum targets for EAIP and LTIP were 50 percent, 100 percent, and 200 percent for 2024 (for all eligible participants, except the CEO). EAIP and LTIP Incentive awards for the CEO are calculated in the same manner except that the scorecard achievement ranges from 0 percent to 150 percent instead of 0 percent to 200 percent. 
 (3) Target incentive opportunities as a percentage of salaries were as follows: Mr. Lyash, 150 percent; Mr. Thomas, 80 percent; Mr. Moul, 80 percent; Mr. Fountain, 70 percent; and Mr. Rausch, 70 percent. Additionally, a corporate multiplier ranging between 0 and 1.1 may be applied which can reduce the award to 0. An individual performance multiplier of up to 150 percent may also be applied which may increase the award to 225 percent of target for all NEOs except for the CEO, whose maximum award is 150 percent of target. Actual EAIP awards earned for performance in 2024 are reported for each of the NEOs under the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table. 
 (4) At the end of the performance period, TVA's LTIP Scorecard was applied to the grants in order to determine LTP award payouts. For 2024, the TVA Board exercised discretion to adjust the CEO's calculated LTP payout percentage from 114 percent to 82 percent. Award payouts are reported for each of the NEOs under the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table. 
 (5) All LTR awards will be paid in a lump sum within two months of the September 30th vesting date except in the case of death, disability, or retirement. The awards will be paid in cash after deducting applicable federal, state, and local withholding taxes. In the case of death, the beneficiary will be paid as soon as administratively practicable but in no event later than the last day of the second full calendar month following the participant's death. Disability awards will be paid as soon as administratively practicable but in no event later than the last day of the second full calendar month following the participant's separation from service due to disability. Actual LTR awards earned in 2024 are reported for each of the NEOs under the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table. 
 (6) At the end of the performance period, TVA's LTIP Scorecard will be applied to the grants in order to determine LTP award payouts. The final award may be adjusted by the TVA Board in its discretion in appropriate circumstances.

 (3) Mr. Lyash, Mr. Moul, Mr. Fountain, and Mr. Rausch are not eligible to participate in the TVARS pension plan since they were hired after June 30, 2014. 
 
 Qualified Retirement Plans 
 
 The retirement benefits for which employees are eligible and receive under the TVARS pension plan and 401(k) plan depend on the employee's hire date, years of service, and individual elections, as follows: 
 
 Employees who were first hired prior to January 1, 1996, receive (1) a traditional pension benefit calculated based on the employee's creditable service, the employee's average monthly salary for the highest three consecutive years of eligible compensation, and a pension factor based on the employee's age and years of service, less a Social Security offset, and (2) 401(k) plan matching contributions from TVA. The 401(k) plan matching contribution is 0.25 on every dollar contributed by the employee up to six percent of eligible compensation, for a maximum matching contribution of 1.5 percent of eligible compensation. None of the NEOs are in this group. 
 
 Employees who were first hired prior to January 1, 1996, and who elected to switch pension structures from traditional to cash balance, receive (1) a cash balance pension benefit calculated based on (a) pay-based credits and interest that accrue over time in the employee's account and (b) the employee's age at the time of retirement, and (2) 401(k) plan matching contributions from TVA. The monthly pay credits are equal to six percent of eligible compensation, and monthly interest is credited at an annual interest rate equal to the change in the CPI-U plus three percent (with a minimum of six percent and maximum of 10 percent). The interest rate during 2024 was 7.69 percent. The 401(k) plan matching contribution is 0.75 on every dollar contributed by the employee up to six percent of eligible compensation, for a maximum matching contribution of 4.5 percent of eligible compensation. None of the NEOs are in this group. 
 
 Employees who were first hired on or after January 1, 1996, and who had 10 or more years of service as of October 1, 2016, receive (1) a cash balance pension benefit calculated based on (a) pay-based credits and interest that accrue over time in the employee's account and (b) the employee's age at the time of retirement, and (2) 401(k) plan non-elective and matching contributions from TVA. The monthly pay credits are equal to three percent of eligible compensation, and monthly interest is credited at an annual interest rate equal to the change in the CPI-U plus two percent (with a minimum of 4.75 percent and a maximum of 6.25 percent). The interest rate during 2024 was 6.25 percent. The 401(k) plan automatic, non-elective contribution is equal to three percent of eligible compensation, and the matching contribution is 0.75 on every dollar contributed by the employee up to six percent of eligible compensation, for a maximum matching contribution of 4.5 percent of eligible compensation. Mr. Thomas is in this group. 
 
 Employees who were first hired on or after January 1, 1996, and who had less than 10 years of service as of October 1, 2016, receive (1) a cash balance pension benefit calculated based on pay-based credits and interest that accrue over time

 in the employee's account and the employee's age at the time of retirement, and (2) 401(k) plan non-elective and matching contributions from TVA. As of October 1, 2016, the cash balance accounts of these employees receive no additional pay-based credits; however, the accounts continue to receive monthly interest credits at an annual interest rate equal to the change in the CPI-U plus two percent (with a minimum of 4.75 percent and a maximum of 6.25 percent). The interest rate during 2024 was 6.25 percent. The 401(k) plan automatic, non-elective contribution is equal to six percent of eligible compensation, and the matching contribution is dollar-for-dollar on employee contributions up to six percent of eligible compensation, for a maximum matching contribution of six percent of eligible compensation. None of the NEOs are in this group. 
 
 Employees who were hired prior to July 1, 2014, and who elected to waive their cash balance retirement benefit and transfer their cash balance account to the 401(k) plan effective October 1, 2018, receive a retirement benefit in the 401(k) plan only. The 401(k) plan is an automatic, non-elective contribution that is equal to six percent of eligible compensation, and the matching contribution is dollar-for-dollar on employee contributions up to six percent of the eligible compensation, for a maximum matching contribution of six percent of eligible compensation. None of the NEOs are in this group. 
 
 Employees who were first hired on or after July 1, 2014 (or who were rehired and were either previously not vested in the pension plan or cashed out their pension benefit) receive a retirement benefit in the 401(k) plan only. The 401(k) plan automatic, non-elective contribution is equal to 4.5 percent of eligible compensation, and the matching contribution is 0.75 on every dollar contributed by the employee up to six percent of eligible compensation, for a maximum matching contribution of 4.5 percent of eligible compensation. Mr. Lyash, Mr. Moul, Mr. Fountain, and Mr. Rausch are in this group. 
 
 Cash Balance Pension . For NEOs who are eligible for retirement benefits under the pension plan, which includes Mr. Thomas, eligible compensation is defined as annual salary only for benefit calculation purposes and is shown under the column titled "Salary" in the Summary Compensation Table. The eligible compensation in 2024 could not exceed 330,000 pursuant to the IRS annual compensation limit applicable to qualified plans. Employees with cash balance benefits who have at least five years of cash balance service are eligible at retirement or termination of employment to receive an immediate benefit in the form of a monthly pension with survivor benefit options or in a lump-sum payment with cash out or rollover options. The pension plan does not provide for early retirement benefits to any NEO or any other employee eligible for cash balance benefits. 
 
 401(k) Plan . All employees eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan, including the NEOs, may elect to contribute to the 401(k) plan on a before-tax, Roth, and/or after-tax basis, and in-plan Roth rollovers by participant election are available. Contributions to a participant's 401(k) plan account by TVA and the participant during 2024 could not exceed 69,000 pursuant to the IRS annual contribution limit applicable to qualified plans. For purposes of matching and non-elective contributions from TVA to the 401(k) accounts of the NEOs, eligible compensation is defined as annual salary only for benefit calculation purposes and is shown under the column titled "Salary" in the Summary Compensation Table. The eligible compensation in 2024 could not exceed 330,000 pursuant to the IRS annual compensation limit applicable to qualified plans. Any participant in the 401(k) plan must have three years of TVA service to be vested in matching and non-elective contributions from TVA. 
 
 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
 
 All NEOs are participants in the SERP. The SERP is a non-qualified defined benef it pension pla n similar to those typically found in other companies in TVA's peer group and is provided to a limited number of executives, including the NEOs. TVA's SERP was created to recruit and retain key executives. The plan is designed to provide a competitive level of retirement benefits in excess of the limitations on contributions and benefits imposed by TVA's qualified defined benefit plan and Internal Revenue Code Section 415 limits on qualified retirement plans. 
 
 The SERP provides two distinct levels of participation, Tier 1 and Tier 2. Each participant is assigned to one of the two tiers at the time he or she is approved to participate in the SERP. The level of participation ("Tier") defines the level of retirement benefits under the SERP at the time of retirement. 
 
 Under the SERP, normal retirement eligibility is age 62 with five years of vesting service. No vested and accrued benefits are payable prior to age 55, and benefits are reduced for retirements prior to age 62. The level of reduction in benefits for retirements prior to age 62 depends on whether a participant's termination is "approved" or "unapproved." In the event of an approved termination of TVA employment, any vested and accrued benefits are reduced by 5/12 percent for each month that the date of benefit commencement precedes the participant's 62nd birthday, up to a maximum reduction of 35 percent. In the event of an unapproved termination of TVA employment, the participant's accrued benefits are first subject to a reduced percentage of vesting if the participant's years of service are between five and 10. At five years of vesting service, the vested percentage of retirement benefits is 50 percent and increases thereafter by 10 percent for each full additional year of service, reaching 100 percent vesting for 10 or more years of vesting service. Thereafter, any vested and accrued benefits are reduced by 10/12 percent for each month that the date of benefit commencement precedes the participant's 62nd birthday up to a maximum reduction of 70 percent. 
 
 For purposes of the SERP, an "approved" termination means termination of employment with TVA due to (1) retirement on or after the participant's 62nd birthday, (2) retirement on or after attainment of actual age 55, if such retirement has the approval of the TVA Board or its delegate, (3) death in service as an employee, (4) disability (as defined under the Rules and Regulations of 
 203 

Table of Contents 

 the TVARS) as determined by the Retirement Committee, or (5) any other circumstance approved by the TVA Board or its delegate. For purposes of the SERP, an "unapproved" termination means a termination of employment with TVA when such termination does not constitute an "approved" termination as defined in the preceding sentence. 
 
 SERP Tier 1 . The Tier 1 structure is designed to replace 60 percent of the amount of a participant's compensation at the time the participant reaches age 62 and has accrued 24 years of TVA service. Tier 1 benefits are based on a participant's highest average compensation during three consecutive SERP years and a pension multiple of 2.5 percent for each year of credited service up to a maximum of 24 years. Compensation is defined as salary and EAIP for benefit calculation purposes. Tier 1 benefits are offset by Social Security benefits, benefits provided under TVA's qualified defined benefit pension plan, and prior employer pension benefits when applicable. 
 
 SERP Tier 2 . The purpose of this restoration plan is to adjust qualified plan benefits to executives when benefits are lost due to IRS limits . Pension be nefits are based on a participant's average compensation over three consecutive fiscal years and a pension multiplier of 1.3 percent for each year of service. For benefit calculation, pension in cludes salary and annual incentives. 

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
 
 The following table provides information regarding deferred contributions, earnings, and balances for each of the NEOs. The amounts reported under this table do not represent compensation in addition to the compensation that was earned in 2024 and already reported in the Summary Compensation Table, but rather the amounts of compensation earned by the NEOs in 2024 or prior years that were or have been deferred.

 (1) Includes vested contributions. None of these amounts are included in the Summary Compensation Table as compensation for 2024. 
 (2) Includes vested earnings. Because none of the amounts are above market or preferential earnings under SEC rules, none of these amounts are included in the Summary Compensation Table. 
 (3) Includes vested contributions and earnings. 36,396 of this amount has been reported in the Summary Compensation Table as compensation for a prior fiscal year. 
 (4) Includes vested contributions and earnings. 80,717 of this amount has been reported in the Summary Compensation Table as compensation for a prior fiscal year. 
 
 TVA's compensation plans may allow participants to defer all or a portion of compensation earned under the plans as defined by plan terms and IRS regulations. All deferrals are credited to each participant in a deferred compensation account, and the deferral amounts are then funded into a rabbi trust. Each participant may elect one or more investment options made available by TVA or allow some or all funds to accrue interest at the rate established by the beginning of each fiscal year equal to the composite rate of all Treasury issues. Participants may elect to change from either one notional investment option or the TVA interest bearing option to another at any time. Generally, upon termination of employment, funds are distributed pursuant to elections made in accordance with applicable IRS regulations.

 Executive Severance Plan 
 
 All NEOs are participants in the TVA Executive Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan"). The Severance Plan provides that if TVA terminates an NEO s employment other than for Gross Misconduct (as defined below) or such participant terminates employment for Good Reason (as defined below), such participant will be eligible to receive the following benefits in addition to his or her accrued compensation: 
 
 For the CEO, a lump sum severance payment equal to the applicable multiplier times the employee's annual base salary, and continued healthcare benefits for a number of complete or partial years equal to such multiplier. The applicable multiplier is 1.0 for the CEO. 
 
 For the other NEOs, a lump sum severance payment equal to the applicable multiplier times the sum of the employee s annual base salary and target annual incentive, and continued healthcare benefits for a number of complete or partial years equal to such multiplier. The applicable multiplier is 1.0 for the other NEOs. 
 
 Any earned but unpaid incentive payments, and a prorated annual incentive payment for the year of termination based on actual achievement of performance goals. 
 
 In order to receive severance benefits under the Severance Plan, participants must timely execute (and not revoke) a release of claims in favor of TVA and comply with all applicable post-separation restrictive covenants. The terms of the Severance Plan will supersede rights and obligations with respect to severance under existing agreements to which Severance Plan participants are a party. 
 
 Under the Severance Plan, Good Reason shall mean the occurrence of any of the following: 
 
 a material adverse change in the participant s authority, duties, or responsibilities (excluding during any period of participant s physical or mental incapacity) with respect to his or her employment with TVA without the participant s prior written consent; 
 
 a material reduction in the participant s base salary without the participant s prior written consent (other than any reduction applicable to management employees generally); 
 
 an actual change in the participant s principal work location by more than 50 miles and more than 50 miles from the participant s principal place of abode as of the date of such change in job location without the participant s prior written consent; or 
 
 a material breach by TVA of any term or provision of the Severance Plan without the participant s prior written consent. 
 
 A participant may be considered to have Good Reason to terminate employment for purposes of the Severance Plan only if the participant provides written notice to TVA of termination within 30 days of the occurrence of the applicable event(s) or, if later, within 30 days of the date the participant has knowledge that such event(s) occurred. An event constituting Good Reason shall no longer constitute Good Reason if the circumstances described in the Good Reason notice are cured by TVA within 30 days following receipt of the Good Reason notice. 
 
 Under the Severance Plan, Gross Misconduct shall mean any of the following: 
 
 misconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or gross negligence that directly results in significant economic or reputational harm to TVA; 
 
 insubordination, intentional neglect of duties, or refusal to cooperate with investigations of TVA s business practices; 
 
 conviction of a crime amounting to a felony under the laws of the United States or any of the several states, or a crime of moral turpitude; 
 
 a significant violation of TVA s Code of Ethics or Code of Conduct; or 
 
 disclosure without authorization of proprietary or confidential information of TVA.

 Potential Payments on Account of Resignation, Retirement, Termination without Cause, Termination with Cause, Death, or Disability 
 
 The tables below show certain potential payments that would have been made to each NEO if his or her employment had been terminated on September 30, 2024, under various scenarios: retirement, resignation, resignation for Good Reason, termination without Cause, termination with Cause, death, and Disability. The tables below also include payments from the following sources: Severance Plan, SERP, EAIP, deferred cash recruitment/relocation incentive, LTR, LTP, and deferred compensation. 
 
 The following provides background information on certain payments included in the termination tables: 
 
 Resignation. The Resignation column covers resignations that do not qualify as resignations for Good Reason under TVA's Severance Plan. See Executive Compensation Tables and Narrative Disclosures - Executive Severance Plan for a definition of Good Reason. 
 
 Retirement. The Retirement column covers situations where an employee separates from service after having met one of the following criteria: (1) the employee has reached the age of 55 with at least 10 years of full-time TVA service, (2) the employee has reached the age of 60 with at least five years of full-time TVA service, or (3) the employee is in the Civil Service Retirement System or Federal Employees Retirement System and is eligible for an immediate retirement benefit upon termination as outlined in the applicable plan. 
 
 Severance Plan and Termination without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason. The Severance Plan provides that if TVA terminates an NEO's employment other than for Gross Misconduct or such participant terminates employment for Good Reason, such participant will be eligible to receive certain benefits in addition to his or her accrued compensation. See Executive Compensation Tables and Narrative Disclosures - Executive Severance Plan for definitions of Gross Misconduct and Good Reason, and for a discussion of the benefits provided to NEOs under the Severance Plan. 
 
 SERP. The SERP payments in the tables represent the present value of the accumulated benefit unless otherwise noted. 
 
 SERP Payment in Event of Death. In the event of a participant s death while employed by TVA, the participant s beneficiary will receive a lump sum payment equal to the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that would have been paid had the participant terminated employment on the date of death and elected a joint and 50 percent survivor benefit. The beneficiary will receive 50 percent of the reported value. 
 
 LTR Payment in Event of Retirement. The LTIP provides that if a participant retires, the participant is entitled to any portion of a LTR award that had vested at the time of the separation from service but not been paid as well as a prorated portion of any LTR grant that had not vested at the time of the participant's separation from service, provided the amount of any such LTR award for each vesting period within the retention cycle is prorated based on the number of whole months the participant was employed by TVA during such vesting period. 
 
 LTR Payment in Event of Death . The LTIP provides that in the event of the death of a participant, the participant's beneficiary is entitled to any portion of a LTR award that had vested at the time of the participant's death but not been paid as well as a prorated portion of any LTR grant that had not vested at the time of the participant's separation from service, provided that the LTR award for each vesting period will be prorated based on the number of whole months the participant was employed by TVA during the vesting period in which the participant separated from service as compared to (1) 12 months for the vesting period that includes the day that the participant separated from service, (2) 24 months for the vesting period that immediately follows the vesting period during which the participant separated from service, and (3) 36 months for the second vesting period that follows the vesting period during which the participant separated from service. 
 
 LTR Payment in Event of Disability. The LTIP provides that if a participant separates from service due to a disability, the participant is entitled to any portion of a LTR award that had vested at the time of the separation from service but not been paid as well as a prorated portion of any LTR grant that had not vested at the time of the participant's separation from service, provided that the LTR award will be prorated based on the number of whole months the participant was employed by TVA during the vesting period in which the participant separated from service as compared to (1) 12 months for the vesting period that includes the day that the participant separated from service, (2) 24 months for the vesting period that immediately follows the vesting period during which the participant separated from service, and (3) 36 months for the second vesting period that follows the vesting period during which the participant separated from service. 
 
 LTP Payment in the Event of Retirement. The LTIP provides that if a participant retires, the participant is entitled to (1) any LTP award that had vested at the time of the participant's separation from service but not been paid and (2) a prorated portion of any LTP awards that had not vested at the time of the participant's separation from service, provided that the amount of any such LTP award (a) is calculated using the actual percent of opportunity achieved and (b) is prorated based on the number of whole months the participant is employed by TVA during the applicable performance cycle. Jeff Lyash and John Thomas are the only NEOs who were eligible to retire as of September 30, 2024, and the LTP amounts included 
 206 

Table of Contents 

 in their Retirement columns assume that the percent of opportunity achieved will be 100 percent of target for the performance cycles ending on September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2026. 
 
 LTP Payment in Event of Death. The LTIP provides that in the event of the death of a participant, the participant's beneficiary is entitled to (1) any LTP award that had vested at the time of the participant's death but not been paid and (2) any LTP awards that had not vested at the time of the participant's death and that covered a performance cycle for which the participant had received a LTP grant, provided that the amount of any such LTP award (a) will be calculated assuming that the percent of opportunity achieved is 100 percent of target and (b) will be prorated based on the number of whole months the participant was participating in the plan during the applicable performance cycle. 
 
 LTP Payment in Event of Disability. The LTIP provides that if a participant separates from service due to a disability, the participant is entitled to (1) any LTP award that had vested at the time of the participant's separation from service but not been paid and (2) any LTP awards that had not vested at the time of the participant's separation from service and that covered a performance cycle for which the participant had received a LTP grant, provided that the amount of any such LTP award (a) will be calculated assuming that the percent of opportunity achieved is 100 percent of target and (b) will be prorated based on the number of whole months the participant was employed by TVA during the applicable performance cycle. 
 
 In addition to the amounts set forth in the termination tables, all NEOs would also be entitled to payments from plans generally available to TVA employees under the specific circumstances of termination of employment, including the health and welfare and pension plans and amounts in the 401(k) plan.

 Director Compensation 
 
 The TVA Act provides for up to nine directors on the TVA Board. As of November 13, 2024, the TVA Board consisted of eight members. Under the TVA Act, each director receives certain stipends that are increased annually by the same percentage increase applicable to adjustments under 5 U.S.C. 5318, which adjusts the annual rates of pay of employees on the Executive Schedule of the U.S. Government. Effective January 1, 2024, the annual stipend for TVA directors was increased fr om 58,400 to 61,100 per year unless (1) the director chairs a TVA Board committee, in which case the stipend was increased from 59,500 to 62,300 per year, or (2) the director is the Chair of the TVA Board, in which case the stipend was increased from 65,000 to 68,100 per year. Directors are also reimbursed under federal law for travel, lodging, and related expenses while attending meetings and for other official TVA business. 
 
 The annual stipends provided by the TVA Act for each director and for the Chair of the TVA Board as of November 13, 2024, are listed below:

 Notes 
 (1) TVA directors do not participate in the TVARS Retirement Plans, TVA's SERP, or any non-qualified deferred compensation plan available to TVA employees. However, as appointed officers of the U.S. government, the directors are members of FERS. FERS is administered by the federal Office of Personnel Management, and information regarding the value of FERS pension benefits is not available to TVA. 
 (2) These amounts include TVA's non-elective and matching contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan. 
 
 The directors are not eligible to participate in any incentive programs available to TVA employees. The directors do not participate in the TVARS Retirement Plans and do not participate in TVA's SERP. However, as appointed officers of the U.S. government, the directors are members of the Federal Employees Retirement System ("FERS"). FERS is a tiered retirement plan that includes three components: (1) Social Security benefits, (2) the Basic Benefit Plan, and (3) the Thrift Savings Plan ("TSP"). As members of FERS, each director is required to make a mandatory percentage contribution of his or her stipend to the Basic Benefit Plan in the amount of 0.8 percent for those directors appointed prior to January 1, 2013, 3.1 percent for those directors appointed between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, and 4.4 percent for those directors appointed on or after January 1, 2014. 
 
 209 

Table of Contents 

 The FERS Basic Benefit Plan is a qualified defined benefit plan that provides a retirement benefit based on a final average pay formula that includes age, highest average salary during any three consecutive years of service, and years of creditable service. A director must have at least five years of creditable service to be eligible to receive retirement benefits. Directors are eligible for immediate, unreduced retirement benefits once (1) they reach age 62 and have five years of FERS creditable service, (2) they reach age 60 and have 20 years of FERS creditable service, or (3) they attain the minimum retirement age and accumulate the specified years of service as set forth in the FERS regulations. Generally, benefits are calculated by multiplying 1.0 percent of the highest average salary during any three consecutive years of service by the number of years of creditable service. Directors who retire at age 62 or later with at least 20 years of FERS creditable service receive an enhanced benefit (a factor of 1.1 percent is used rather than 1.0 percent). 
 
 Each director is also eligible to participate in the TSP. The TSP is a tax-deferred retirement savings and investment plan that offers the same type of savings and tax benefits offered under 401(k) plans. Once a director becomes eligible, TVA contributes an amount equal to one percent of the director's stipend into a TSP account for the director. These contributions are made automatically every two weeks regardless of whether the director makes a contribution of his or her own money. Directors are eligible to contribute up to the TSP elective deferral limit. Directors receive matching contributions of 100 percent of each dollar for the first three percent of the director's stipend and 50 percent of each dollar for the next two percent of the director's stipend. 
 
 TVA offers a group of health and other benefits (medical, dental, vision, life and accidental death and disability insurance, and long-term disability insurance) that are available to a broad group of employees. Directors are eligible to participate in TVA's health benefit plans and other non-retirement benefit plans on the same terms and at the same contribution rates as other TVA employees.

 Not applicable. 

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Director Independence 
 
 The composition of the TVA Board is governed by the TVA Act. The TVA Act contains certain provisions that are similar to the considerations for independence under section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act, including that to be eligible for appointment to the TVA Board, an individual shall not be an employee of TVA and shall make full disclosure to Congress of any investment or other financial interest that the individual holds in the energy industry. 

Related Party Transactions 
 
 Conflict of Interest Provisions 
 
 All TVA employees, including directors and executive officers, are subject to the conflict of interest laws and regulations applicable to employees of the federal government. Accordingly, the general federal conflict of interest statute (18 U.S.C. 208) and the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 C.F.R. part 2635) ("Standards of Ethical Conduct") form the basis of TVA's policies and procedures for the review, approval, or ratification of related party transactions. The general federal conflict of interest statute, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits each government employee, including TVA's directors and executive officers, from participating personally and substantially (by advice, decision, or otherwise) as a government employee in any contract, controversy, proceeding, request for determination, or other particular matter in which, to his or her knowledge, he or she (or his or her spouse, minor child, general partner, organization with which he or she serves as officer, director, employee, trustee, or general partner, or any person or organization with which he or she is negotiating, or has an arrangement, for future employment) has a financial interest. Exceptions to the statutory prohibition relevant to TVA employees are (1) financial interests which have been deemed by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, in published regulations, to be too remote or inconsequential to affect the integrity of the employee's services, or (2) interests which are determined in writing, after full disclosure and on a case-by-case basis, to be not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the employee's services for TVA. Any waiver determinations would be made in accordance with applicable federal law and regulation. 
 
 More broadly, Subpart E of the Standards of Ethical Conduct provides that where an employee (1) knows that a particular matter involving specific parties is likely to have a direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of a member of his or her household, or that a person with whom the employee has a "covered relationship" (which includes, but is not limited to, persons with whom the employee has a close family relationship and organizations in which the employee is an active participant) is or represents a party to the matter, and (2) determines that the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of relevant facts to question his or her impartiality in the matter, the employee should not participate in the matter absent agency authorization. This authorization may be given by the employee's supervising officer, as agency designee, in consultation with the TVA Designated Agency Ethics Official, upon the determination that TVA's interest in the employee's participation in the matter outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the integrity of TVA's programs and operations. 
 
 The previously described restrictions are reflected in TVA's policies which require employees, including directors and executive officers, to comply with the guidelines outlined in the Standards of Ethical Conduct and which restate the standard of the conflict of interest statute. 
 
 Additionally, the TVA Board approved a written conflict of interest policy that applies to all TVA employees, including TVA's directors and executive officers. The conflict of interest policy reaffirms the requirement that all TVA employees must comply with applicable federal conflict of interest laws, regulations, and policies. It also establishes an additional policy that is applicable to TVA's directors and CEO. This additional policy provides that TVA's directors and CEO shall not hold a financial interest in (1) any distributor of TVA power; (2) any entity engaged primarily in the wholesale or retail generation, transmission, or sale of electricity, except where substantially all such business is conducted outside of North America; or (3) any entity that may reasonably be perceived as likely to be adversely affected by the success of TVA as a producer or transmitter of electric power. Any waiver of this additional policy may be made only by the TVA Board and will be disclosed promptly to the public, subject to the limitations on disclosure imposed by law. 
 
 TVA also has a protocol titled the "Obtaining Things of Value from TVA Protocol" (the "Protocol"). The Protocol describes what a TVA employee should do if a person covered by the Protocol asks for assistance in obtaining a specified thing of value from TVA. Similarly, the TVA Board Practice on External Inquiries describes what a member of the TVA Board should do if a person covered by the practice asks for assistance in obtaining a specified thing of value from TVA.

 TVA relies on the policies, practices, laws, and regulations discussed above to regulate conflicts of interest involving employees, including directors and executive officers. TVA has no other written or unwritten policy for the approval or ratification of any transactions in which TVA was or is to be a participant and in which any director or executive officer of TVA (or any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law of any director or executive officer of TVA) had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
 
 Other Relationships 
 
 TVA is engaged in a number of transactions with other agencies of the U.S. government, although such agencies do not fall within the definition of "related parties" for purposes of Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. These include, among other things, supplying electricity to other federal agencies, purchasing electricity from the Southeastern Power Administration, and engaging in various arrangements involving nuclear materials with the Department of Energy. See Part I, Item 1, Business and Note 23 Related Parties . 
 
 TVA also has access to a financing arrangement with the United States Department of the Treasury ("U.S. Treasury"). TVA and the U.S. Treasury have a memorandum of understanding under which the U.S. Treasury provides TVA with a 150 million credit facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under the facility at September 30, 2024. This credit facility has a maturity date of September 30, 2025, and is typically renewed annually. This arrangement is pursuant to the TVA Act. Access to this credit facility or other similar financing arrangements with the U.S. Treasury has been available to TVA since the 1960s. See Note 14 Debt and Other Obligations Credit Facility Agreements . 
 
 In addition, TVA is required by the 1959 amendment to the TVA Act to make annual payments to the U.S. Treasury from net power proceeds as a repayment of and as a return on the government's appropriation investment in TVA's power facilities (the "Power Program Appropriation Investment") until 1.0 billion of the Power Program Appropriation Investment has been repaid. With the 2014 payment, TVA fulfilled its requirement to repay 1.0 billion of the Power Program Appropriation Investment. The TVA Act requires TVA to continue to make payments to the U.S. Treasury indefinitely as a return on the remaining 258 million of the Power Program Appropriation Investment. See Note 23 Related Parties . 
 
 The TVA Act requires the proceeds for each fiscal year derived from the sale of power or any other activities to be paid into the U.S. Treasury on March 31 of each year, except for the portion of such proceeds as in the opinion of the TVA Board shall be necessary for TVA in the operation of dams and reservoirs and in conducting its business in generating, transmitting, and distributing electric energy. For each fiscal year, the TVA Board adopts a resolution retaining for use in the operation of the TVA power system the entire margin of net power proceeds remaining at the conclusion of such fiscal year.

 The TVA Board has an Audit, Risk, and Cybersecurity Committee ("Audit Committee"). Under the TVA Act, the Audit Committee, in consultation with the Inspector General, recommends to the TVA Board the selection of an external auditor. TVA's Audit Committee, in consultation with the Inspector General, recommended that the TVA Board select Ernst Young LLP as TVA's external auditor for the 2024 and 2023 audits and other related services, and the TVA Board approved these recommendations. 
 
 TVA has a policy (the "Policy") that requires all auditing services and permissible non-audit services provided by the external auditor to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Policy also lists the following services as ones the external auditor is not permitted to perform: 
 
 Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of TVA; 
 Financial information system design and implementation; 
 Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, and contribution-in-kind reports; 
 Actuarial services; 
 Internal audit outsourcing services; 
 Management functions or human resources; 
 Broker or dealer, investment adviser, or investment banking services; 
 Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit; and 
 Any other services that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board determines, by regulation, are impermissible. 
 
 The Policy also delegates to the Chair of the Audit Committee the authority to pre-approve a permissible service so long as the amount of the service does not exceed 100,000 and the total amount of services pre-approved during the year by the Chair does not exceed 200,000. The Chair must report for informational purposes the services pre-approved under this provision at the Audit Committee's next meeting. 
 
 The Audit Committee pre-approved all audit services for 2024 and 2023.

Section 3.2 Rent . The Facility Lessee hereby agrees to pay to the Owner Lessor basic lease rent Basic Lease Rent for the lease of the Facility during the Facility Lease Term in installments payable on each Rent Payment Date in the amount set forth opposite such Rent Payment Date under the columns entitled Basic Lease Rent (Debt Portion) and Basic Lease Rent (Equity Portion) on Schedule 1 hereto, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 3.4 hereof.

All Supplemental Lease Rent to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall be payable in the manner set forth in Section 3.5 . 
 Section 3.4 Adjustment of Lease Schedules . 
 (a) The Facility Lessee and the Owner Lessor agree that Basic Lease Rent shall be adjusted after the Closing Date, either upwards or downwards, to reflect (i) a reduction in Basic Lease Rent in connection with a partial termination of the Facility Lease pursuant to Section 15 calculated in accordance with the second sentence of Section 3.2 , (ii) a reduction in Basic Lease Rent in connection with the prepayment of one or more Equity Notes in connection with a Regulatory Event of Loss calculated in accordance with Section 13.2(c) , and (iii) either a reduction or an increase in Basic Lease Rent to reflect the principal amount, amortization and interest rate on any Additional Lessor Notes issued pursuant to Section 2.12 of the Lease Indenture in connection with (A) a refinancing of the Lessor Notes pursuant to Section 11.1 of the Participation Agreement or (B) a Supplemental Financing pursuant to Section 11.2 of the Participation Agreement. Any adjustments pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall be calculated in a manner to ensure that Basic Lease Rent payable hereunder is in an amount sufficient to enable the Owner Lessor to pay the principal of and interest on the Lessor Notes (after taking into account such Additional Lessor Notes issued pursuant to Section 11.2 of the Participation Agreement and refinancing of Lessor Notes in 

3 

accordance with Section 11.1 of the Participation Agreement, as applicable) due and payable on each scheduled payment date in respect of such Lessor Note and to preserve the return on and of the Equity Investment and, in the case of a Supplemental Financing, any Additional Equity Investment made pursuant to Section 11.2 of the Participation Agreement, as contemplated at the time the Equity Investment or Additional Equity Investment, if any, was made through the end of the Facility Lease Term calculated in a manner consistent with the initial calculation of the return on and of the Equity Investment of the Owner Lessor and the Equity Investor, including as to the U.S. federal, state and local income tax consequences of the return on and of such investment and of the receipt of Basic Lease Rent and Supplemental Lease Rent by the Owner Lessor for the payment of amounts due and payable by the Owner Lessor under or with respect to the Lessor Notes or the Lease Indenture. The adjustments contemplated by this Section 3.4 will result in corresponding adjustments to the Termination Values. Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.4(a) shall be made subject to and in compliance with Section 3.4(b) hereof. 
 (b) Anything herein or in any other Transaction Document to the contrary notwithstanding, Basic Lease Rent payable on any Rent Payment Date, whether or not adjusted in accordance with this Section 3.4 , shall, in the aggregate, be in an amount at least sufficient to pay in full the scheduled principal of and interest payments on the Lessor Notes on such Rent Payment Date, other than any such scheduled principal of and interest payments on the Lessor Notes to the extent paid from the Construction Period Financing Account pursuant to Section 2.17 of the Lease Indenture. Anything herein or in any other Transaction Document to the contrary notwithstanding, Termination Values on any date under this Facility Lease, whether or not adjusted in accordance with this Section 3.4 , shall, together with Basic Lease Rent due and owing on such date, be in an amount at least sufficient to pay in full the principal of, and accrued interest on, the Lessor Notes payable on such date. 
 (c) Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall initially be computed by the Facility Lessee, subject to the verification procedure described in this Section 3.4(c) . Once computed, the results of such computation shall promptly be delivered by the Facility Lessee to the Owner Lessor. Within 20 days after the receipt of the results of any such adjustment, the Owner Lessor may request that a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants (which firm shall not be the primary accountants for the Facility Lessee, the Owner Lessor, the Equity Investor or the Lease Indenture Trustee) jointly selected by the Owner Lessor and the Facility Lessee (the Verifier verify, after consultation with the Owner Lessor and the Facility Lessee, the accuracy of such adjustment in accordance with this Section 3.4 . The Owner Lessor and the Facility Lessee hereby agree, subject to the execution by the Verifier of an appropriate confidentiality agreement, to provide the Verifier with all information and materials (other than income tax returns) as shall be necessary in connection therewith. If the Verifier confirms that such adjustment is in accordance with this Section 3.4 , it shall so certify to the Facility Lessee and the Owner Lessor and such certification shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Facility Lessee, the Owner Lessor and the Equity Investor. If the Verifier concludes that such adjustment is not in accordance with this Section 3.4 , and the adjustments to Basic Lease Rent or Termination Value calculated by the Verifier are different from those calculated by the Facility Lessee, then it shall so certify to the Facility Lessee and the Owner Lessor and the Verifier s calculation shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Facility Lessee, the Owner Lessor and the Equity Investor. If the Owner Lessor does not request verification of any adjustment within the period specified 

4 

above, the computation provided by the Facility Lessee shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Facility Lessee, the Owner Lessor and the Equity Investor. The final determination of any adjustment hereunder shall be set forth in an amendment to this Facility Lease, executed and delivered by the Owner Lessor and the Facility Lessee provided, however , that any omission to execute and deliver such amendment shall not affect the validity and effectiveness of any such adjustment. The reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the Verifier in verifying an adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall be paid by the Facility Lessee. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the sole responsibility of the Verifier shall be to verify the calculations hereunder and matters of interpretation of this Facility Lease or any other Transaction Document shall not be within the scope of the Verifier s responsibilities.

The arbitrators so chosen shall meet within 10 Business Days after the second arbitrator is appointed and within 20 Business Days thereafter shall decide the dispute. If within such period they cannot agree upon their decision, they shall within 10 Business Days thereafter appoint a third arbitrator and, if they cannot agree upon such appointment, the third arbitrator shall be appointed upon their application or upon the application of either party, by the American Arbitration Association, or any organization which is a successor thereto from a panel of arbitrators having expertise in the business of operating simple cycle combustion turbines.
