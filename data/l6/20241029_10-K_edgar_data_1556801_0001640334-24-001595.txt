BUSINESS Business Overview We were formerly classified as a shell company and have since transitioned into active operations following the acquisition of RAC Real Estate Acquisition Corp. ("RAC"). We no longer maintain the status of a shell company due to these developments. In July 2022, we acquired RAC, a Wyoming-based corporation, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Through RAC, the Company focuses on real estate transactions, particularly the acquisition, development, and sale or rental of low-income housing. Our investment approach is segmented into three primary areas: Acquiring, refurbishing, and selling traditional foreclosures; Purchasing, developing, and renting properties in "Land Banks," which typically comprise over 100 homes or lots in a single location; Acquiring, refurbishing, or developing homes available through HECM (Home Equity Conversion Mortgage) pools. On January 31, 2023, the Company changed its corporate name to My City Builders, Inc., through the merger of the Company with its wholly owned subsidiary, My City Builders, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Subsidiary ). Pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger between the Company and the Subsidiary, the Subsidiary was merged with and into the Company and the Company s name was changed to My City Builders, Inc. The only change to the Company s articles of incorporation was the change of the Company s corporate name. Pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 92A.180, the merger did not require stockholder approval. On April 26, 2023, FINRA notified the Company that their review of our corporate name change, disclosed in our 8-K filed on February 1, 2023, with the SEC, was complete and that the announcement of the merger, name and symbol change for the Company had been announced on their Daily List on April 26, 2023. The corporate action took effect at the open of business on April 27, 2023, in the open market. The Company s new trading symbol is MYCB. On March 27, 2023, RAC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement dated effective March 27, 2023, (the Agreement with, Frank Gillen, an individual Mr. Gillen and Michael Colvard, an individual Mr. Colvard ). The purpose of the LLC is to build 3-bedroom 2-bathroom single-family low-income homes in Gadsden Alabama. On May 05, 2023, Mr. Colvard s construction agreement with RAC was terminated and Mr. Colvard transferred his 1 and withdrew as a member and manager of the LLC. On October 4, 2022, the Company, through RAC, entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement with Fix Pads Holdings, LLC ("Fix Pads"). As a result of the agreement, RAC and Fix Pads formed a limited liability company called RAC FIXPADS II, LLC LLC ), incorporated in the state of Delaware. The LLC has two members, RAC and Fix Pads, both providing an initial contribution to the LLC of 1,000 in exchange for a 50 membership interest represented by an issuance of 1,000 Units of the LLC to each party. Each member is entitled to one vote per member. The LLC is managed by a manager, Fix Pads. The agreement provides that additional capital contributions of the members will be made to the LLC as follows: (i) Fix Pads will transfer and assign all rights to and incidents of ownership for up to 60 residential properties it has title, or will have title, to the LLC, as set forth in the agreement; and (ii) RAC will make additional cash contributions to the capital of the LLC, up to a maximum of 5,214,000, on such dates and in such amounts as requested by the LLC, in the manner set forth in the agreement. From the sale of each property by the LLC, the Company shall receive 13,000 and the average additional cash capital contribution per property. During the years ended July 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company invested 0 and 2,679,500 and recognized impairment loss of 947,500and 1,732,000, respectively. Since the acquisition of RAC, the Company, through our third-party vendor, has financed the clearance of 55 titles in the name of Fix Pads Holdings. On July 22, 2022, the Company received a promissory note, in the principal amount of 672,960 from, and entered into a Loan Agreement dated July 18, 2022, with, Fix Pads Holdings, LLC. The note had a 12 interest rate per annum payable of 672,960. Consideration for the note was paid in part by the Company in the amount of 328,626, net of prepayment interest and in part by a third-party investor in the amount of 328,626. On August 18, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note of 358,620. The note had a 12 interest rate per annum payable of 358,620 and was due on August 1, 2023. Consideration for the note was paid in part by the Company in the amount of 175,007, net of prepayment interest and in part by a third-party investor in the amount of 175,007. During the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company collected principal of 444,325 and interest of 67,457, of which principal of 157,105 and interest of 28,133 (totaling 185,238) were collected on behalf of a third-party investor and recorded as accrued liabilities as of July 31, 2023. On July 23, 2024, the Company repaid outstanding due of 185,238. On July 7, 2023, RAC filed an ongoing lawsuit with Fix Pad Holdings, therefore, no further interest income was recognized. During the years ended July 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded interest income of 0 and 49,187, respectively. 5 Table of Contents On May 19, 2023, RAC filed a complaint for breach of two promissory notes entered into with Fix Pads Holdings, LLC and for injunctive relief in the 11 th Judicial Circuit Court in Miami-Dade County Florida, as well as an emergency motion for temporary injunction enjoining Fix Pads Holdings, LLC from selling, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any real property assets pledged as collateral in relation to the two promissory notes entered into between RAC and Fix Pads. In addition to the injunctive relief sought above, RAC is also seeking damages for breach of the promissory notes. After RAC filed and served the lawsuit, Fix Pads removed the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on May 24, 2023. As such, the case is now proceeding in the Southern District of Florida. RAC has obtained temporary injunctive relief against Fix Pads. On July 7, 2023, RAC filed a complaint for appointment of receiver, breach of Limited Liability Company Agreement, and breach of fiduciary duty in the 11 th Judicial Circuit Court of Miami-Dade County, Florida against Fix Pads Holdings LLC, FixPads Management, LLC and RAC FixPads II, LLC. RAC seeks a receiver to be appointed to wind up the real property assets of RAC FixPads II, LLC and for damages for breach of the joint venture agreement. In June 2024, the parties entered into two settlement agreements, which FixPads Holdings LLC and the other Defendants agreed to transfer the title of 44 properties to the Company. Pursuant to title search and settlement of taxes and due related to properties, the Company proceeded to obtain the Quitclaim Deed Certificates on 29 properties. The Company intends to sell these properties. As of the date of this report, 29 Quitclaim Deed Certificates were issued, and the rest are under process. The Company obtained the official fair value reports of properties from an independent firm based on sales comparison and secondary sales and recognized the value of 29 properties based on the valuation reports and physical condition of the homes. Some of the homes must be remodeled, therefore its valuation was based on land price or secondary sales and or value per Square Foot. Those valuations were not more than sales comparison price and have been disclosed as nonmonetary gain in the Company s Financial Statements. On April 25th, 2024, RAC finalized the purchase of two additional lots in Gadsden, Alabama bringing the total properties owned in East Gadsden to twenty-two. This decision stemmed from the ongoing construction of three homes by RAC on the same street, slated for completion and rental availability by July 31st, 2024. With the aim of bolstering rental demand, RAC intends to commence construction on these newly acquired lots this calendar year by December 31 st , 2024. The homes are 3-bedroom 2-bathroom single family homes with under roof of 1270 square feet. The plan for Gadsden Alabama is to build new low-income single-family homes for rent. On July 31, 2024, RAC Gadsden LLC entered into a land purchase agreement in Glencoe Alabama. Glencoe is the neighboring town to Gadsden, and the Company plans to build seven to eight duplex apartments on the parcel of land during the calendar year of 2025. As of July 31 st, 2024, RAC has completed eight of the eleven homes under construction in East Gadsden and has seven of the eleven properties leased with monthly lease payments of 1,250, each for a period of one year for each home leased. Organization We are a Nevada corporation incorporated on October 26, 2010, under the name Oconn Industries Corp. On March 11, 2014, we changed our corporate name to Diamante Minerals, Inc. On March 20, 2018, we changed our corporate name to iMine Corporation. On January 31, 2023, we changed our corporate name to My City Builders, Inc. Our address is 100 Biscayne Blvd., #1611, Miami FL 33132, telephone (786) 553-4006. Our corporate website is www.mycitybuilders.com. Sales and Marketing We intend to market our properties to those seeking homes, including to low-income individuals and families. We may engage third party real estate brokers and agents to provide these services. 6 Table of Contents Competition We believe there are only limited barriers to entry into our business. Current and future competitors may have more resources than we have. Our projects face competition generally from REITs, institutional pension plans and other public and private real estate companies and private real estate investors for the acquisition of properties and for raising capital. In transaction services, we face competition with real estate firms in the acquisition and disposition of properties, and we also compete with other sponsors of real estate for investors to provide the capital to allow us to make these investments. We also compete against real estate companies who may be chosen by a broker-dealer as an investment platform instead of us. In management services, we compete with other properties for viable investors for properties. Real estate development is a highly competitive business. We compete with numerous developers, builders and others for the acquisition of property. As we attempt to expand our operations, we will certainly be competing with other businesses ranging from large multinational corporations to small startup business such as us. Many of our competitors may have longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry. Government Regulations Real Property Development The real estate development industry is subject to environmental, building, construction, zoning and real estate regulations that are imposed by various federal, state and local authorities. In developing a community, we must obtain the approval of various government agencies regarding matters such as permitted land uses, housing density, installation of utility services and the dedication of acreage for open space, parks, schools and other community purposes. Federal, state and local regulations affect real property development by specifying, among other things, the type and quality of building material that must be used, certain aspects of land use and building design and the way homebuilders may conduct their sales, operations and overall relationships with potential renters and buyers. Changes in prevailing local circumstances or applicable laws may require additional permits and approvals or modifications of approvals previously obtained. Permits and approvals will vary depending on the type and location of the land being developed. Timing of the beginning and completion of developmental projects can depend upon receipt of necessary authorizations, permits and approvals. Because of the provisional nature of these approvals and the concerns of various environmental and public interest groups, the approval process can be delayed by withdrawals or modifications of preliminary approvals and by litigation and appeals challenging development rights. Our ability to develop projects could be delayed or prevented due to litigation challenging previously obtained governmental approvals. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or slow-growth or no-growth initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Such delays could adversely affect our ability to complete our projects, significantly increase the costs of doing so or drive potential customers to purchase competitors products. Management Services The Company, any salespeople we may have and, in some instances, property managers we may employee may be regulated by the states in which we do business. These regulations may include licensing procedures, prescribed professional responsibilities and anti-fraud provisions. Our activities may also be subject to various local, state, national and international jurisdictions fair advertising, trade, housing and real estate settlement laws and regulations and are affected by laws and regulations relating to real estate and real estate finance and development. Environmental Compliance Federal, state and local laws and regulations impose environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, disclosure obligations and other restrictions that impact the management, development, use or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities with respect to some properties. If transactions in which we are involved are delayed or abandoned as a result of these restrictions, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, a failure by us to disclose environmental concerns to potential investors or third-party buyers of the developed property may subject our company to liability and may adversely impact our business or cause us to incur costs for cleanup of hazardous substances or wastes or other environmental liabilities. 7 Table of Contents Various environmental laws and regulations also can impose liability for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous or toxic substances at sites currently or formerly owned or operated by a party, or at off-site locations to which such party sent wastes for disposal. As a potential property manager, we could be held liable as an operator for any such contamination; even if the original activity was legal and we had no knowledge of, or did not cause, the release or contamination. Further, because liability under some of these laws is joint and several, we could be held responsible for more than our share, or even all, of the costs for such a contaminated site if the other responsible parties are unable to pay. Similarly, we are generally obliged, under the debt financing arrangements on the properties owned by us, to provide indemnity to the lenders for environmental liabilities and to remediate any environmental problems that might arise. Insurance for these matters may not always be available, or sufficient to cover our losses. Employees As of the date of this report, the Company employs two part-time executives: Interim CEO Yolanda Goodell and Interim CFO Francis Pittilloni. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this annual report before making an investment decision with regard to our securities. The statements contained in this annual report include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. The risks set forth below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties may exist that could also adversely affect our business, prospects or operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or a significant part of your investment. Because of our lack of cash and our working capital deficiency, we will not have resources to expand our business of acquiring, developing and selling/renting real estate, and we will need to raise funds for such activities. At July 31, 2024, we have cash of 20,245 and a working capital of 64,205, and, because our only current source of revenue is interest income from two promissory notes the Company acquired in connection with our business plan. If we are unable to obtain funding for these activities we may be unable to complete an acquisition or file our delinquent SEC quarterly reports. If we are unable to implement our business plan because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations. Any financing which we may be able to obtain is likely to be on very unfavorable terms and, if equity is issued, may result in significant dilution to our stockholders. Subsequent to our completion of an acquisition, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. We did not have the financial resources to conduct extensive due diligence in our acquisition of RAC, material issues may be present inside RAC that we did not uncover or factors outside of RAC s business and outside of our control may arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses or losses significantly in excess of those we may anticipate based on the financial statement of RAC. Even if our due diligence successfully identified certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject under pre-existing of RAC or by virtue of our obtaining post-acquisition debt financing. 8 Table of Contents Our auditors report includes a going concern paragraph. Our financial statements include a going-concern paragraph. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net income of 25,752. As of July 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 2,019,954 and has nominal revenues since inception and only recently engaged in an active business. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plans to raise necessary funding through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ended July 31, 2024. However, until the Company engages in an active business or makes an acquisition the Company is likely to not be able to raise any significant debt or equity financing. The ability of the Company to begin operations in its new business model is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining financing to commence operations and develop a business plan or making an acquisition. The Company cannot give any assurance as to its ability to develop or acquire a business or to operate profitably. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to attract, train and retain technical and financial personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected. It is likely that our future success will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, train and retain key management, technical and financial personnel. Recruiting and retaining capable personnel, particularly for a company with no history of earnings or operations will be vital to our success. We anticipate that there will be substantial competition for qualified personnel. We cannot assure you we will be able to attract or retain the technical and financial personnel we require. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Risks Concerning our Common Stock Because our common stock is a penny stock, you may have difficulty selling our common stock. Our common stock is a penny stock, as defined by the SEC regulations, and therefore is subject to the rules adopted by the SEC regulating broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. The SEC rules may have the effect of reducing trading activity in our common stock by making it more difficult for investors to purchase and sell their shares. The SEC s rules require a broker or dealer proposing to effect a transaction in a penny stock to deliver the customer a risk disclosure document that provides certain information prescribed by the SEC, including, but not limited to, the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker or dealer must also disclose the aggregate amount of any compensation received or receivable by him in connection with such transaction prior to consummating the transaction. In addition, the SEC s rules also require a broker or dealer to make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction before completion of the transaction. The existence of the SEC s rules may result in a lower trading volume of our common stock and lower trading prices. Further, some broker-dealers will not process transactions in penny stocks. There is a limited market for our common stock, which may make it difficult for you to sell your stock . Our common stock trades on the OTC Pink marketplace under the symbol MYCB. The OTC Pink market is not a national securities exchange and does not provide the benefits to stockholders which a national exchange provides. Furthermore, according to the OTC Markets website, the OTC Pink is for all types of companies that are there by reasons of default, distress or design, which is why they are further segmented based on the level of information that they provide. There is a limited trading market for our common stock and there are frequently days on which there is no trading in our common stock. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may develop for our common stock, the ability of holders of our common stock to sell our common stock, or the prices at which holders may be able to sell our common stock. Further, because of the thin float, the reported bid and asked prices may have little relationship to the price you would pay if you wanted to buy shares or the price you would receive if you wanted to sell shares. 9 Table of Contents Exercise of Series A Preferred shares or future convertible instruments may have a dilutive effect on our common stock. We have outstanding 100,000 Series A Preferred shares which are exercisable at a 25 discount to the next financing of at least 1,000,000. If the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise of these or future options or warrants, or conversion of any future convertible notes or any other convertible securities is in excess of the various exercise or conversion prices of such convertible securities, exercise or conversion of such convertible securities would have a dilutive effect on our common stock. Further, any additional financing that we secure may require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock and which result in additional dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common stockholders. Our lack of internal controls over financial reporting may affect the market for and price of our common stock. Our disclosure controls and our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. We do not have the financial resources or personnel to develop or implement systems that would provide us with the necessary information on a timely basis so as to be able to implement financial controls. Our financial condition together with the fact that we presently have two part-time employees, one of which is both our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and does not have an accounting background, makes it difficult for us to implement a system of internal controls over financial reporting, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and implement the necessary controls. The absence of internal controls over financial reporting may inhibit investors from purchasing our shares and may make it more difficult for us to raise debt or equity financing. Further, we cannot assure you that, if we make an acquisition, we will be able to implement internal controls over financial reporting. Because we anticipate that any company, we may acquire will not have internal controls over financial reporting in effect, we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement such internal controls. Our lack of a full-time chief financial officer could affect our ability to develop financial controls, which could affect the market price for our common stock. We do not have a full-time chief financial officer. At present, our chief executive officer, who does not have an accounting background, is also acting as our chief financial officer. We do not anticipate that we will be able to hire a qualified chief financial officer unless our financial condition improves significantly. The lack of an experienced chief financial officer, together with our lack of internal controls, may impair our ability to raise money through a debt or equity financing as well as the market for and the market price of our common stock. We do not have any independent directors. At present, we do not have any independent directors. Our board consists of two directors, one of which is Yolanda Goodell, who is our interim chief executive officer and Francis Pittilloni, who is our interim chief financial officer. Because we have no independent directors, we do not have many checks and balances on the directors, which may make it difficult for us to develop internal controls and to raise money in the financial markets. 10 Table of Contents Our stock price may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value. The dollar volume of trading in our stock is low and we cannot assure you that any significant market will develop. As a result, any reported prices may not reflect the price at which you would be able to sell shares if you want to sell any shares you own or buy shares if you wish to buy share. Further, stocks with a low trading volume may be more subject to manipulation than a stock that has a significant public float. The price of our stock may fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following, in addition to the risks described above and general market and economic conditions: our low stock price, which may result in a modest dollar purchase or sale of our common stock having a disproportionately large effect on the stock price; the market s perception as to our ability to make an acquisition that can generate revenue and net income; the market s perception as to our ability to generate positive cash flow or earnings following an acquisition or change in business; changes in our or securities analysts estimate of our financial performance; our ability or perceived ability to obtain necessary financing for our operations; the perception of the market for the principal products which any company we may acquire or any business we may seek to develop and our ability to generate revenue and cash flow from that business or proposed business; the risks associated with any business we may acquire or any business we may seek to develop; the anticipated or actual results of our operations; changes in market valuations of other companies in our industry; litigation or changes in regulations affecting our industry; concern about our lack of internal controls; any discrepancy between anticipated or projected results and actual results of our operations; the effect or anticipated effect of changes in trade and tariffs on our business; actions by third parties to either sell or purchase stock in quantities which would have a significant effect on our stock price; and other factors not within our control. Raising funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities could dilute the net tangible book value of the common stock and impose restrictions on our working capital. If we were to raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, either alone or in connection with non-equity financing, the net tangible book value of the then outstanding common stock could decline. If the additional equity securities were issued at a per share price less than the market price, which is customary in the private placement of equity securities, the holders of the outstanding shares would suffer a dilution, which could be significant. We may have difficulty in raising funds through the sale of debt securities because of both our financial position, the thin market for our stock; the lack of any collateral on which a lender may place a value, and the absence of any history of revenue or operations. If we can raise funds from the sale of debt securities, the lenders may impose restrictions on our operations and may impair our working capital as we service any such debt obligations. We do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 11 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On March 23, 2023, RAC was awarded a judgement from the District Court in Clark County Nevada enabling the company to cancel common shares held in the name of HUI PING LIU. These shares were originally issued to HUI PING LIU for no consideration by our former CEO Daniel Tsai. On May 19, 2023, RAC filed a complaint for breach of two promissory notes entered into with Fix Pads Holdings, LLC and for injunctive relief in the 11 th Judicial Circuit Court in Miami-Dade County Florida, as well as an emergency motion for temporary injunction enjoining Fix Pads Holdings, LLC from selling, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any real property assets pledged as collateral in relation to the two promissory notes entered into between RAC and Fix Pads. In addition to the injunctive relief sought above, RAC is also seeking damages for breach of the promissory notes. After RAC filed and served the lawsuit, Fix Pads removed the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on May 24, 2023. As such, the case is now proceeding in the Southern District of Florida. RAC has obtained temporary injunctive relief against Fix Pads. On July 7, 2023, RAC filed a complaint for appointment of receiver, breach of LLC agreement, and breach of fiduciary duty in the 11 th Judicial Circuit Court of Miami-Dade County, Florida against Fix Pads Holdings LLC, FixPads Management, LLC and RAC FixPads II, LLC. RAC seeks a receiver to be appointed to wind up the real property assets of RAC FixPads II, LLC and for damages for breach of the joint venture agreement. In June 2024, the parties entered into two settlement agreements, which FixPads Holdings LLC and the other defendants agreed to transfer the title of 44 properties to the Company. Pursuant to title search and settlement of taxes and due related to properties, the Company proceeded to obtain the quitclaim deed certificate of 29 properties. The Company intends to sell these properties. As of the date of this report, 24 quitclaim deed certificates were issued, and the rest are under process. RAC plans to start the renovation and completion of the properties during this calendar year and have all twenty-nine homes fully renovated by the next calendar year. All twenty-nine homes will be immediately placed for sale once fully renovated. On July 23 rd , 2024, as part of the settlement agreements RAC paid 185,238.37 as part of the proceeds owed to Frank Campanero on the secured loans dated July 22, 2022, and August 18, 2022. ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Overview In July 2022, we acquired RAC, a Wyoming-based corporation, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Through RAC, the Company focuses on real estate transactions, particularly the acquisition, development, and sale or rental of low-income housing. Our investment approach is segmented into three primary areas: Acquiring, refurbishing, and selling traditional foreclosures; Purchasing, developing, and renting properties in "Land Banks," which typically comprise over 100 homes or lots in a single location; Acquiring, refurbishing, or developing homes available through HECM (Home Equity Conversion Mortgage) pools. On March 27, 2023, RAC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement dated effective March 27, 2023, (the Agreement with, Frank Gillen, an individual Mr. Gillen and Michael Colvard, an individual Mr. Colvard ). The purpose of the LLC is to build 3-bedroom 2-bathroom single-family low-income homes in Gadsden Alabama. On May 05, 2023, Mr. Colvard s construction agreement with the LLC was terminated and Mr. Colvard transferred his 1 and withdrew as a member and manager of the LLC. On April 25th, 2024, RAC finalized the purchase of two additional lots in Gadsden, Alabama bringing the total properties owned in East Gadsden to twenty-two. This decision stemmed from the ongoing construction of three homes by RAC on the same street, slated for completion and rental availability by July 31st, 2024. With the aim of bolstering rental demand, RAC intends to commence construction on these newly acquired lots this calendar year by December 31 st , 2024. The homes are 3-bedroom 2-bathroom single family homes with under roof of 1270 square feet. The plan for Gadsden Alabama is to build new low-income single-family homes for rent. On July 31, 2024, RAC Gadsden LLC entered into a land purchase agreement in Glencoe Alabama. Glencoe is the neighboring town to Gadsden, and we plan to build seven to eight duplex apartments on the parcel of land during the calendar year of 2025. As of July 31 st, 2024, RAC has completed eight of the eleven homes under construction in East Gadsden and has eight of the eleven properties leased with monthly lease payments of 1,250, each for a period of one year for each home leased. Result of operations The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended July 31, 2024, and 2023, which are included herein. 14 Table of Contents Our operating results for the years ended July 31, 2024, and 2023, and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows: Years Ended July 31, 2024 2023 Change Revenue 59,300 49,187 (10,113 Operating expenses 337,670 202,462 135,208 Other (income) expenses (304,122 1,869,360 (2,173,482 Net (income) loss (25,752 2,022,635 (2,048,387 For the years ended July 31, 2024, and 2023, we generated revenue from interest income of 0 and 49,187 and revenue from rent income of 59,300 and 0, respectively. We had a net income of 25,752 for the year ended July 31, 2024, and net loss of 2,022,635 for the year ended July 31, 2023. The decrease in net loss of 2,048,387 were primarily attributed to a reduction in other expenses of 2,173,482, offset by an increase in operating expenses of 135,208 and revenue of 10,113 Operating expenses for the years ended July 32, 2024, and 2023 were 337,670 and 202,462, respectively. For the years ended July 31, 2024, and 2023, the operating expenses were primarily attributed to professional fees of 235,940 and 177,931, general and administrative expenses of 55,774 and 24,531, depreciation expenses of 31,985 and 0, cost of rental homes of 13,971 and 0, respectively. The cost of rental homes was for rented homes such as lawncare, maintenance and repairs, management fees, utilities, insurance and property taxes. Other income and expenses for the years ended July 31, 2024, and 2023, represent impairment loss on investment of 947,500 and 1,732,000, interest expenses related party of 27,795 and 137,360 for granted loans and interest expenses of 19,279 and 0 for bank borrowing and third-party loan, nonmonetary gain of 1,298,696 and 0 respectively. The nonmonetary gain of 1,298,696 is related to settlement agreements with Fix Pads Holdings in connection with twenty-nine homes which the Quitclaim Deed Certificates were issued to the Company. The Company obtained the official fair value reports of properties from an independent firm based on sales comparison and secondary sales and recognized the value of twenty-nine (29) properties based on the valuation reports and physical condition of the homes. Some of the homes must be remodeled, therefore its valuation was based on land price or secondary sales and or value per Square Foot. Those valuations were not more than sales comparison price.

Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net gain of 25,752. As of July 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 2,019,954. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plans to raise necessary funding through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ended July 31, 2024. However, until the Company engages in an active business or makes an acquisition the Company is likely not to be able to raise any significant debt or equity financing. The ability of the Company to begin operations in its new business model is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining financing to commence operations and develop a business plan or making an acquisition. The Company cannot give any assurance as to its ability to develop or acquire a business or to operate profitably. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 16 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements. Use of Estimates The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that directly affect the results of reported assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, including the valuation of non-cash transactions. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which requires the Company to recognize revenues when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue based on the five criteria for revenue recognition established under Topic 606: (i) Identify the contract, or contracts, with a tenant; (ii) Identify the performance obligations in the rental contract; (iii) Determine the transaction price; (iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Rental income The Company generated rental income from operating leases, which is accounted for under ASC 842. Operating lease revenue is generally recognized on straight-line basis over the terms of the lease agreements. Cost of rental homes The cost of rental homes are expenses directly related to rental homes, such as lawncare, maintenance and repairs, management fees, utilities, insurance and property taxes. Commitments and Contingencies The Company follows ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies , to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. 17 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company has implemented all new pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or results of operations. Nonmonetary Transactions The Company follows ASC 450, Non-Monetary Transactions and considers ASC 450-30 Contingencies , to report accounting for recognition homes inventory for sales and nonmonetary gain on settlement of lawsuit. Concentration As pf July 31, 2024, and 2023 and for the years ended July 31, 2024, and 2023, customer concentrations (more than 10 were as follows: Revenue -rental income Percentage of Revenue For The Year ended July 31, 2024 2023 Tenant A 15.89 - Tenant B 24.08 - Tenant C 25.66 - Tenant D 17.85 - Tenant E 8.39 - Tenant F 5.03 - Tenant G 2.32 - Tenant H 0.78 - Total (as a group) 100.00 - Accounts receivable The rental properties are managed by a management company during the year ended July 31, 2024, therefore 100 of accounts receivable is related to one customer at July 31, 2024.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE On February 26, 2024, we engaged TPS Thayer, LLC - Certified Public Accountants TPS as our new independent accountants. During our two most recent fiscal years ended July 31, 2023, and through the date of Form 8-K, neither we, nor anyone on our behalf, has consulted with TPS regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and either a written report was provided to us or oral advice was provided that the new accountant concluded was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to this item) or a reportable event (as described in paragraph 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Management s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure Controls ), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of July 31, 2024, the end of the year covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. The Disclosure Controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, due to our limited internal audit function and the absence of any accounting staff, our disclosure controls were not effective as of July 31, 2024, such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the chief executive officer/chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404 ). Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. During our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024, management identified material weaknesses related to (i) our internal audit functions (ii) inadequate levels of review of the financial statements, (iii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions, (iii) the absence of any full-time accounting personnel, and (v) the absence of any independent directors. Therefore, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of July 31, 2024. Management has determined that our internal controls contain material weaknesses due to the absence of segregation of duties, as well as lack of qualified accounting personnel and excessive reliance on third party consultants for accounting, financial reporting and related activities. The lack of any separation of duties, with the same person, who is our only employee who serves as both chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and who does not have an accounting background and serves on a part-time basis, makes it unlikely that we will be able to implement effective internal controls over financial reporting in the near future. 19 Table of Contents Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties is not possible. However, to the extent possible, we plan to implement procedures to assure that the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions will be performed by separate individuals if and when we have sufficient income to enable us to hire such individuals, and we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to hire such personnel. Our financial condition makes it difficult for us to implement a system of internal controls over financial reporting. Until we generate significantly greater revenues and employ accounting personnel, it is doubtful that we will be able to implement any system which provides us with any degree of internal controls over financial reporting. Due to the nature of this material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, there is more than a remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to our annual or interim financial statements could not be prevented or detected. A material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the year ended July 31, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of My City Builders, Inc. (the Company as of July 31, 2023, the related consolidated statement of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at July 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that My City Builders, Inc. will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from operations and is in need of additional capital to grow its operations so that it can become profitable. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans with regard to these matters are described in Note 3. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee or the Board of Directors and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Investment Impairment Assessment Description of the Matter As described in Note 6 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company invested 2,679,500 pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement entered on October 4, 2022. In 2023, the Company filed a complaint for breach of the Limited Liability Company Agreement, and both parties participated in a mediation concerning the lawsuit. As of the date of this report, both parties are in process of finalizing the mediation agreement. Investment is tested for impairment at least annually and the determination of the fair value of the investment requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The litigation for the breach of Limited Liability Company Agreement could indicate that the carrying value of investment may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the investment is determined to not be recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Auditing the Company's impairment assessment is challenging because of the subjective auditor judgment necessary in evaluating management's assumptions and assessment of the estimated fair value. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit Our primary audit procedures to address management s assessment regarding the impairment include: Obtaining an understanding and reviewing the tentative agreement on all material terms to concerning this matter. Obtaining an understanding and evaluating management s assumptions and assessment in determining the estimated fair value of the investment and the impairment charge. /s/ KCCW Accountancy Corp.
