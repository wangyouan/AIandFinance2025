 NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 
 
 This Annual Report contains historical information as well as forward-looking statements. Statements looking forward in time are included in this Annual Report pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results in future periods to be materially different from any future performance suggested herein. We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following forward-looking statements, among others, sometimes have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual results during 2024 and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on our behalf. 
 
 Item 1. Business. 
 
 General Development of Business 
 
 Overview 
 
 We intend to commence business operations by offering real estate management services for clients that focus on cost efficient operations and tenant retention on a range of properties including residential housing and Class A, B, and C office space, as well as industrial, manufacturing, retail, and warehousing facilities. We also intend to provide our clients with real estate consulting services, including market analysis and modeling, market forecasts, lease and asset management, site selection, feasibility studies, sales and exit strategies, strategic planning, organizational design, capital management, and research services. We intend to commence operations in the Las Vegas, Nevada area due to the significant demand for real estate management services there and the proximity of our management team to that city. 
 
 We were only incorporated on March 24, 2021, and have not commenced pursuing our business plan because we have been focused on raising the initial capital to fund our business operations. From our incorporation on March 24, 2021, to July 31, 2024, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of 106,914. To date, we have raised an aggregate of 83,400 through the sale of our common stock. Proceeds from these sales were used to fund the filing of our registration statement and will be used for working capital. Further losses are anticipated in the development of our business. As a result, our auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Anticipated Services 
 
 We intend to provide clients with two principal types of services: (1) property management; and (2) property consulting. 
 
 Property Management Services 
 
 As property managers, the services that we intend to provide to owners of residential, commercial, and industrial properties include: 
 
 completing an initial evaluation of properties and working with the owners to determine a target rental or lease rate; 
 
 gathering comparable rental and lease rates in the area of the properties; 
 
 reviewing the properties to determine if any repairs or upgrades should be recommended to the owners to increase rental or lease value; 
 
 gathering detailed information regarding the features of the properties, including interior and exterior photographs; 
 1 
 
 discussing with the owners the policies that they would like to implement with respect to the rental or lease arrangements (e.g., acceptability of pets in a residential property; acceptable uses for commercial and industrial properties); 
 
 marketing the properties for rent or lease by creating advertisements in various media including online, print, onsite signage, and fliers depending on the suitability of each medium for the type of property involved; 
 
 answering potential tenant and lessee inquiries; meeting with them to view properties; and collecting applications and deposits; 
 
 performing background and credit checks on prospective tenants and lessees; 
 
 communicating with the property owners regarding prospective tenants and lessees; 
 
 preparing and overseeing the execution of lease agreements; 
 
 performing move-in inspections with tenants and lessees and having them execute a report verifying the condition of the property prior to the lease commencement date; 
 
 collecting security deposits, rents, and lease payments; 
 
 pursuing late payments and fees; 
 
 where necessary, preparing the necessary paperwork to evict or commence an unlawful detainer action; 
 
 performing periodic property inspections and providing the results of each inspection to the owner if there are concerns regarding the condition of the property; 
 
 providing accounting services to document and record cash inflows and outflows, as well as related invoices, receipts, and payment information; 
 
 preparing monthly cash flow statements and annual reports of financial results including required tax documents for the owners; 
 
 overseeing maintenance and repairs on properties; and 
 
 managing tenant and lessee move-out including inspections, damage assessment, and damage deposit returns. 
 
 We intend to generate revenue by charging owners a set monthly fee for our property management services, which will usually be based on a percentage of the revenue that a rented or leased property generates. Such fees will vary depending on the type of property involved, the amount of work that we will have to perform, and the rates that competitors charge for similar services. 
 
 Property Consulting Services 
 
 As property consultants, the services that we intend to provide include: 
 
 preparing plans of action and evaluation for clients considering real estate acquisitions and development; 
 
 interpreting relevant real estate market data concerning price, yield, market stability, investment risks and trends, regulation, and economic influences; 
 
 searching public records for transactions such as sales, leases, and assessments; 
 
 computing property values while considering factors such as depreciation, replacement cost, comparable properties, and income potential; 
 
 obtaining county land values and sales information in support of value assessments; 
 2 

checking building codes and zoning bylaws that may impact appraisal and development; 
 
 estimating building replacement costs using building valuation manuals and professional cost estimators; 
 
 inspecting properties to evaluate construction, condition, features, and functional design; 
 
 evaluating land and neighborhoods where properties are situated including assessing locations, trends, and pending changes that could influence present and developed land value; 
 
 providing market analysis and modelling for properties, as well as market forecasts and research; and 
 
 providing advice on site selection, feasibility studies, sales and exit strategies, strategic planning, organizational design, and capital management. 
 
 We intend to generate revenue by charging owners either an hourly rate for our services or a set price for certain service that we reach through negotiation with the clients. Initially, two of our directors, Gregory Navone, and James C. Shaw will provide these services to clients. As our operations expand, we will need to retain additional staff in order to provide all of the above-noted services. 
 
 Demand for Property Management and Consulting Services 
 
 According to the University of Nevada - Las Vegas Center for Business and Economic Research s 2019 report, the population of Clark County in which Las Vegas is situated is expected to grow from 2,284,616 residents in 2018 to approximately 2,719,000 residents in 2030, which represents a population increase of about 19 within that time frame. Cumming Corporation, an international construction management company that provides forecasts regarding construction trends in various jurisdictions, projects that the residential construction will increase in 2021 by almost 30 with multi-family rather than single-family residences driving this growth. However, the firm foresees that demand will outpace supply due to labor and supply chain constraints. These trends will likely increase demand for residential, commercial, and industrial real estate in the area, as well as increase demand for property management and consulting services. 
 
 Marketing Strategy 
 
 While we intend to offer our services to all sectors of the property management and consulting markets, we will initially focus on commercial real and multi-unit residential estate given our president s experience in developing and operating shopping centers and apartment buildings in Las Vegas. We believe that we will be able to charge higher rates for our services in these sectors because they tend to generate relatively higher profit margins for owners and often require significant professional management and advice due to the large scale of construction and operations. 
 
 In order to reach our target market sectors, we intend to rely upon the real estate and other business relationships that our directors have established in the Las Vegas area and also focus our marketing efforts on our Internet presence, electronic brochures, and as our business develops, print media advertising. We believe that social media tools are critically important to building our brand and awareness of our business and will focus on online video advertising, client testimonials, and virtual tours of available properties that we manage. We also intend to select and place advertising on those social media platforms that will be effective in reaching our target clients. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The real estate management sector, including real estate consulting, is extremely fragmented and competitive. The sector includes large entities that provide services nationally, such as Greystar Real Estate Partners Lincoln Property Company, and CRBE Group, as well as real estate investment trusts and real estate developers that have in-house real estate management. There are also many well-established residential, commercial, and industrial property management companies that solely focus on the Las Vegas area. 
 
 Since the principal competitive factors in providing property management services are pricing, reputation, and quality of service, the fact that most of our competitors have greater financial resources, enjoy greater economies of scale, and have established reputations will make it more difficult for us to gain market share. We also expect to continue to 
 3 
 
 face competition from new market entrants. We may be unable to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Government Regulation 
 
 Nevada State Licensing Requirements 
 
 Under Nevada law, property management is considered to be a real estate activity requiring a real estate broker s license. In order to lease, rent, list, collect rents, procure prospects, or negotiate, assist, or offer to perform any of those acts, he or she needs either a salesperson s or broker s license. In addition, he or she must obtain a property manager permit. No broker s license is required if the property manager does not engage in leasing activities, or if they are strictly on-site managers. Currently, only Gregory Navone, our president, has a real estate broker s license in Nevada. He intends to apply for a property manager permit. In order to obtain a Nevada property management permit, a person must have a Nevada real estate license, attend an accredited 24-hour property management pre-permit course, and pass the Nevada property management state examination within one year of the date of application. 
 
 To obtain a license as a real estate salesperson in Nevada, one must complete 90 hours or six semester units of instruction in real estate principles, practices, and law that is given by an approved provider. Additionally, applicants must show proof of passing the national and Nevada state exam within one year of the application date. To obtain a license as a real estate broker in Nevada, a person must complete 64 semester units of instruction. The applicant must have been actively engaged as a full-time licensed real estate broker or salesman for at least two of the four years immediately prior to the issuance of a Nevada broker license and must pass the national and Nevada state exam within one year of the application date. 
 
 Nevada Revised Statute NRS 645 outlines various laws that apply to real estate brokers and salespersons. Among the duties that it imposes on those with a real estate license in Nevada include obligations to: 
 
 1. Not deal with any party to a real estate transaction in a manner which is deceitful, fraudulent or dishonest; 
 
 2. Exercise reasonable skill and care with respect to all parties to the real estate transaction; 
 
 3. Disclose to each party to the real estate transaction as soon as practicable (a) any material and relevant facts, data or information which licensee knows, or with reasonable care and diligence the licensee should know, about the property; and (b) each source from which licensee will receive compensation. 
 
 4. Abide by all other duties, responsibilities and obligations required of the licensee in law or regulations; 
 
 5. Exercise reasonable skill and care to carry out the terms of the brokerage agreement and the licensee s duties in the brokerage agreement; 
 
 6. Not disclose, except to the licensee s broker, confidential information relating to a client for one year after the revocation or termination of the brokerage agreement, unless licensee is required to do so by court order or the client gives written permission; 
 
 7. Seek a sale, purchase, option, rental or lease of real property at the price and terms stated in the brokerage agreement or at a price acceptable to the client; 
 
 8. Present all offers made to, or by the client as soon as practicable, unless the client chooses to waive the duty of the licensee to present all offers and signs a waiver of the duty on a form prescribed by the Nevada Real Estate Division; 
 
 9. Disclose to the client material facts of which the licensee has knowledge concerning the real estate transaction; 
 
 10. Advise the client to obtain advice from an expert relating to matters which are beyond the expertise of the licensee; and 
 
 11. Account to the client for all money and property the licensee receives in which the client may have an interest. 
 4 
 
 Property Management 
 
 NRS 645 also mandates that a property management agreement must include: 
 
 1. The term of the agreement and, if the agreement is subject to renewal, provisions clearly setting forth the circumstances under which the agreement may be renewed and the term of each such renewal; 
 
 2. A provision for the retention and disposition of deposits of the tenants of the property during the term of the agreement and, if the agreement is subject to renewal, during the term of each such renewal; 
 
 3. The fee or compensation to be paid to the broker; 
 
 4. The extent to which the broker may act as the agent of the client; 
 
 5. If the agreement is subject to cancellation, provisions clearly setting forth the circumstances under which the agreement may be cancelled. The agreement may authorize the broker or the client, or both, to cancel the agreement with cause or without cause, or both, under the circumstances set forth in the agreement; and 
 
 6. If the broker intends to provide asset management services for the client, a provision indicating the extent to which the broker will provide those services. 
 
 Subsidiaries 
 
 We do not have any subsidiaries. 
 
 Patents and Trademarks 
 
 We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks. 
 
 Governmental and Industry Regulations 
 
 We will be subject to federal and state laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations including federal securities laws. We will also be subject to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business.

 We have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date.

PART II 
 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. 
 
 Introduction 
 
 We were incorporated on March 24, 2021 under the laws of the State of Wyoming. 
 
 Results of Operations for the Year Ended July 31, 2024 
 
 From August 1, 2023 to our fiscal year end of July 31, 2024, we did not earn any revenue. From August 1, 2023 to our fiscal year end of July 31, 2024, we incurred net loss of 20, 135 consisting entirely of general and administrative fees. 
 
 We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to complete our proposed business plan. For these reasons our auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of July 31, 2024, our current assets of 15,638 consisted of 638 in cash and 15,000 in prepayments and deposits and our total liabilities were 39,152, which consisted entirely of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other methods, the sale of equity or debt securities. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. From August 1, 2023 to July 31, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 120 consisting of our net loss for the period of 20,135 and an increase of accounts payable of 20,015. 
 7 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 From August 1, 2021 to July 31, 2024, we have not had any cash flows from investing activities. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue exploration activities. For these reasons, there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Since our incorporation, we have financed our operations through proceeds from the sale of our common stock. We expect to finance operations through the sale of equity for the foreseeable future, as we do not receive significant revenue from our business operations. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in arranging financing on acceptable terms. 
 
 Our ability to raise additional capital is affected by trends and uncertainties beyond our control. We do not currently have any arrangements for financing and we may not be able to find such financing if required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including investor sentiment. Market factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unavailable to us. 
 
 Our auditors are of the opinion that our continuation as a going concern is in doubt. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon continued financial support from our shareholders and other related parties. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of the date of this annual report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, litigation and warranties. We base its estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
 
 Property and Equipment 
 
 Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment are accounted for by accelerated methods over the following estimated useful lives: 
 
 Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 We review property and equipment for potential impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with the guidance in ASC 360-15-35 Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the long-lived assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the 
 8 
 
 sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If an impairment exists, the resulting write-down would be the difference between the fair market value of the long-lived asset and the related net book value. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Deferred income tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the statutory marginal income tax rate in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the deferred income tax assets or liabilities from period to period. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is required if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

 In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Going Concern 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of 106,914 and net loss of 20,135. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans with regards to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or are required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosure that are material to the financial statement and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

and operating cash outflows of as of July 31, 2024. Further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period no less than 12 months from the date of this report. In order to remain in business, the Company will need to raise capital in the next twelve months. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and proceeds from its public offering. The Company has no written or verbal commitments from shareholders, director or officer to provide the Company with any form of cash advances, loans or other sources of liquidity to meet its working capital needs. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 As supervised by our board of directors and our principal executive and principal financial officer, management has established a system of disclosure, controls and procedures and has evaluated the effectiveness of that system. The system and its evaluation are reported on in the below Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our principal executive and financial officer has concluded that our disclosure, controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of July 31, 2024, were not effective, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024. We carried out this assessment using the criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 
 
 Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
 
 Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of July 31, 2024 and were subject to material weaknesses. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria established in the COSO: 
 
 1 Failing to have an audit committee or other independent committee that is independent of management to assess internal control over financial reporting; and 
 2 Failing to have a director that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm, pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only 
 9 
 
 management s report in this annual report. Management concluded in this assessment that as of July 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. 
 
 There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of our 2024 fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Section 16(A) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
 
 Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than five percent (5 of the Company s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, the Company believes that during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, all such filing requirements applicable to its officers and directors were complied with, except that our three directors were required to file a Form 3 with respect to their shareholdings.

Code of Ethics 
 
 We have not adopted a Code of Ethics that governs the conduct of our officer. 
 
 Audit Committee 
 
 We do not have a formal audit committee or an audit committee financial expert. We do not have an audit committee financial expert because we believe the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further, because we have limited operations, at the present time, we believe the services of a financial expert are not warranted.

This information includes the dollar value of base salaries, bonus awards and number of stock options granted, and certain other compensation, if any.
