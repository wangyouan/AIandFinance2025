doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its major shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to
meet the Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available
or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company can obtain additional financing,
if necessary, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its
stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

As

of our Common Stock.

The
transfer agent for our capital stock is VStock Transfer, LLC, with an address at 18, Lafayette Place, Woodmere, New York 11598 and telephone
number is +1 (212)828-8436. 

Penny
Stock Regulations 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of 1,000,000, or annual
incomes exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

Dividend
Policy 

Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our
board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no obligations or restrictions to declare or pay dividends
on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our board of directors currently intends
to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future.

Plus Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Phoenix Plus Corp., Phoenix Plus International Limited and Phoenix Green Energy Sdn. Bhd.

Basis
of consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

Use
of estimates 

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported
revenue and expenses during the year reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. 

Revenue
recognition 

In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic
606, Revenue from Contracts . ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the
terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations
in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance
obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to
contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers
to its clients. 

Revenue
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The
Company derives its revenue from solar PV system installation services, consultancy services provided
to our customers on engineering, equipment procurement and transportation, construction on solar plant. 

The
revenue from long term contract is recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the end of the reporting
period, the stage of completion is measured by the proportion that costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total
costs. The revenue from non-contract customers is recognized upon the delivery of services. 

The
Company applied judgements and assumptions that significantly affect the determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognized
from contracts with customers for providing renewable energy turnkey solutions, including engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning EPCC ), solar PV installation services on our customers on engineering, equipment procurement and transportation, construction
on solar plant.
The Company measures the performance of service work done by comparing the actual costs incurred with the estimated total costs required
to complete the services. Significant judgements are required to estimate the total contract costs to complete. In making these estimates,
management relied on estimates and also on past experience of completed projects. A change in the estimates will directly affect the
revenue to be recognized. 

Cost
of revenue 

Cost
of revenue includes the cost of services in providing consultancy services and installation services. 

Income
taxes 

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 ).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the year that includes the enactment date. 

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.

Net
loss per share 

The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic loss per share
is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per
share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares
were dilutive. 

Foreign
currencies translation 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded
in the statements of operations. 

The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars US ). The Company s subsidiary in Labuan and Hong Kong
maintains its books and record in United States Dollars US respectively, while the Company s subsidiary in Malaysia
maintains its books and record in Ringgit Malaysia MYR ). Ringgit Malaysia MYR is functional currency as
being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. 

In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not the US are translated
into US , in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. The gains and losses resulting
from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income within the statement of stockholders equity.

Related
parties 

Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control
the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also
considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. 

Fair
value of financial instruments: 

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and
amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 

The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 ),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level
 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level
 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

Leases 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations
by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Most
prominent among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases
under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. As required by the standard, the Company will adopt the provisions of the new standard effective August 1, 2019,
using the required modified retrospective approach. We believe the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates ASUs ). Management periodically reviews new accounting standards that are issued. 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant
segment expenses. The ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU
may have on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures to expand the
disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The ASU 2023-09 is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. 

Early
adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU may have on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.

NAME 
 
 AGE 
 
 POSITION 

1. 
 Lee
 Chong Chow

 Chief
 Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director 

Set
forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of our executive officers and directors for the past five
years. 

Lee
Chong Chow Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director 

Mr.
Lee, aged 54, holds a Bachelor degree of Economic from Shobi University since 2005. After his graduation, he then started up a company
doing small trading and investment in Japan. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Mr. Lee dedicated himself to make best contribution
to improve the human living environment and develop the sustainable energy solar power energy industry. Mr. Lee has invested more than
10 companies that are specializing in green solar power until today. Mr. Lee also has more than 10 years of working experiences in the
solar industry companies such as Fujisolar co.ltd, Choyo Power co.ltd, Vsun co.ltd (Vietnam) and many more which are providing solar
energy solutions. 

Mr.
Lee was appointed as Executive Director of Phoenix Plus Corp .
on January 8, 2023. Subsequently on February 28, 2023, Mr. Lee was appointed as the Chief Executive
Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company. 

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in
other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.
The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers
and Directors as the Company is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company review the Company s internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees
of the Board 

Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Director(s) believe that it is not necessary to have
such committees, at this time, because the Director(s) can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term
is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14)
of the FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because
management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that
retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date.

are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such
time as we are required to do so. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

2 How
Kok Choong is a controlling shareholder of Agape ATP Corporation and owns 50 of the issued and outstanding shares of H D Holding

Kok Choong collectively, in the row of Mr. How. 

Beneficial
ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to
be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares).
In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon
exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership
of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition
rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect
the person s actual voting power at any particular date. 

(1) 
 Beneficial
 ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment
 power with respect to securities. Beneficial ownership also includes shares of stock subject to options and warrants currently exercisable
 or exercisable within 60 days of the date of this table. In determining the percent of common stock owned by a person or entity as
 of the date of this Report, (a) the numerator is the number of shares of the class beneficially owned by such person or entity, including
 shares which may be acquired within 60 days on exercise of warrants or options and conversion of convertible securities, and (b)
 the denominator is the sum of (i) the total shares of common stock outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report (332,699,500
 shares), and (ii) the total number of shares that the beneficial owner may acquire upon exercise of the derivative securities. Unless
 otherwise stated, each beneficial owner has sole power to vote and dispose of its shares.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Phoenix Plus Corporation (the Company as of July 31, 2024
and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, consolidated statements of changes in stockholders 
equity, and consolidated statement of cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2024, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the notes to consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, for the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company incurred net loss of 437,781 and negative cash flow from
operating activities of 653,119 and has accumulated deficit of 2,587,431. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit
matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical
audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

F- 2 

Revenue
recognition 

The
Company has determined that certain performance obligations in relation to project activities are satisfied over time and thus recognises
revenue from this activity over time. 

A
significant proportion of the Company's revenues and profits are derived from project activities. For the financial year ended July 31,
2024, project revenue and cost of sales are as follows: 

Project
 activities 

Revenue: 
 
 USD1,231,334 
 
 (99.9 
 of the Company s revenue) 

Cost
 of sales: 
 
 USD1,279,069 
 
 (99.9 
 of the Company s cost of sales) 

We identified revenue and cost of sales from project activities as an areas requiring audit focus as significant
management s judgement and estimates are involved in estimating the total project costs (which is used to determine gross profit
margin of project activities undertaken by the Company). The amount of revenue and profit recognised from project activities are dependent
on, amongst others, the extent of costs incurred to the total estimated costs of construction to derive the percentage-of-completion and
the estimated total revenue for each of the respective projects. 

In
addressing this area of focus, we performed, amongst others, the following procedures: 

(a) 
 Obtained
 an understanding of the processes and internal controls over the accuracy and timing of revenue recognised in the financial statements,
 including controls performed by management in estimating the total project costs, profit margin and progress of projects; 

(b) 
 For
 individually significant projects, we read the contracts entered into with customers to obtain an understanding of the specific terms
 and conditions; 

(c) 
 Evaluated
 the assumptions applied in estimating the total project costs for each project phase by examining documentary evidence such as letters
 of award issued to contractors to support the budgeted gross project cost. We also considered the historical accuracy of management s
 forecasts for the similar projects within the Company in evaluating the estimated total project costs; 

(d) 
 Evaluated
 the determination of progress of projects by examining supporting evidence such as contractors progress claims and suppliers 
 invoices. 

The
Company s disclosure on contract assets is included in Note 7 to the financial statements.

meet the Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available
or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing,
if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its
stock holders, in the case of equity financing.
