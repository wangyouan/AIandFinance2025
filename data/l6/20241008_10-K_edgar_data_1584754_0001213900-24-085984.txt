Glossary 

The following is a glossary of technical terms
used herein: 

Acoustic wave - a mechanical wave that vibrates in the same
 direction as its direction of travel. 

AlN - Aluminum Nitride. 

Acoustic wave filter - an electromechanical device that provides
 radio frequency control and selection, in which an electrical signal is converted into a mechanical wave in a device constructed
 of a piezoelectric material and then back to an electrical signal. 

Band, channel or frequency band - a designated range of radio
 wave frequencies used to communicate with a mobile device. 

Bulk acoustic wave (BAW) - an acoustic wave traveling through
 a material exhibiting elasticity, typically vertical or perpendicular to the surface of a piezoelectric material. 

Digital baseband - the digital transceiver, which includes the
 main processor for the communication device. 

Duplexer - a bi-directional device that connects the antenna
 to the transmitter and receiver of a wireless device and simultaneously filters both the transmit signal and receive signal. 

Filter - a series of interconnected resonators designed to pass
 (or select) a desired radio frequency signal and block unwanted signals. 

Group III element nitrides - a dielectric material comprised
 of group IIIA element, such as boron (B), aluminum (Al) or gallium (Ga), combined with group 5A (or VA nitrogen) to form a compound
 semiconductor nitride such as BN, AlN, or GaN. For resonators, the dielectric is typically chosen based upon the piezoelectric constant
 of the material in order to generate the highest electromechanical coupling. 

iv 

Insertion Loss - the power losses associated with inserting
 a BAW filter into a circuit. 

Lossy - resistive losses that result in heat generation. 

Metrology - techniques used to evaluate materials, devices and

PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Akoustis Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
was incorporated in 2013. The Company is focused on developing, designing, and manufacturing innovative RF filter solutions for the wireless
industry, including for products such as smartphones and tablets, network infrastructure equipment, Wi-Fi Customer Premise Equipment CPE ),
and defense applications. Filters are critical in selecting and rejecting signals, and their performance enables differentiation in the
modules defining the RF front-end RFFE ). Located between the device s antenna and its digital backend, the RFFE is
the circuitry that performs the analog signal processing and contains components such as amplifiers, filters and switches. We have developed
a proprietary microelectromechanical system MEMS based bulk acoustic wave BAW technology and a unique
manufacturing process flow, called XBAW , for our filters produced
for use in RFFE modules. Our XBAW filters incorporate optimized high purity
piezoelectric materials for high power, high frequency and wide bandwidth operation. We are developing RF filters for 5G, Wi-Fi and defense
bands using our proprietary resonator device models and product design kits PDKs ). As we qualify our RF filter products,
we are engaging with target customers to evaluate our filter solutions. Our initial designs target UHB, sub-7 GHz 5G, Wi-Fi and defense
bands. We expect our RF filter solutions will address problems (such as loss, bandwidth, power handling, and isolation) created by the
growing number of frequency bands in the RFFE of mobile devices, infrastructure and premise equipment to support 5G, and Wi-Fi. We have
prototyped, sampled and shipped our single-band low loss BAW filter designs for 5G frequency bands and 5 GHz and 6 GHz Wi-Fi bands which
are suited to competitive BAW solutions and historically cannot be addressed with low-band, lower power handling surface acoustic wave SAW technology. Additionally, through our wholly owned subsidiary, RFMi, of which we acquired majority ownership in October
2021 and full ownership in April 2023, we operate a fabless business whereby we make sales of complementary SAW resonators, RF filters,
crystal Xtal resonators and oscillators, and ceramic products addressing opportunities in multiple end markets,
such as automotive and industrial applications. We also offer back-end semiconductor supply chain services through our wholly owned subsidiary,
GDSI, which we acquired in January 2023. 

We own and/or have filed applications for patents
on the core resonator device technology, manufacturing facility and intellectual property IP necessary to produce our
RF filter chips and operate as a pure-play RF filter supplier, providing discrete filter solutions direct to Original Equipment
Manufacturers OEMs and aligning with the front- end module manufacturers that seek to acquire high performance filters
to expand their module businesses. We believe this business model is the most direct and efficient means of delivering our solutions
to the market. 

Technology .
Our device technology is based upon bulk-mode acoustic resonance, which we believe is superior to surface-mode resonance for high-band
and ultra-high-band UHB applications that include 4G/LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi, and defense applications. Although some of our target
customers utilize or manufacture the RFFE module, they may lack access to critical UHB filter technology that we produce, which is necessary
to compete in high frequency applications. 

Manufacturing . We currently manufacture
Akoustis high-performance RF filter circuits, using our first generation XBAW wafer process, in our 125,000-square
foot wafer-manufacturing facility located in Canandaigua, New York (the New York Facility ), which we acquired in June 2017.
Our SAW-based RF filter products are manufactured by a third party and sold either directly or through a sales distributor. 

Intellectual Property . As
of September 1, 2024, our IP portfolio included 97 patents. Additionally, as of September 1, 2024, we have 31 pending patent applications.
These patents cover our XBAW RF filter technology from raw materials through the system architectures. Given the significance
of the Company s intellectual property to its business, the Company enforces its intellectual property rights and protects its patent
portfolio, which may include filing lawsuits against companies that the Company believes are infringing upon its patents. The Company
considers protecting its intellectual property rights to be central to its business model and competitive position in the RF filter industry. 

By designing, manufacturing, and marketing our RF filter products to
mobile phone OEMs, defense OEMs, network infrastructure OEMs, and Wi-Fi CPE OEMs, we seek to enable broader competition among the front-end
module manufacturers. 

Since we own and/or have filed applications for
patents on the core technology and control access to our intellectual property, we expect to offer several ways to engage with potential
customers. First, we engage with multiple wireless markets, providing standardized filters that we design and offer as standard catalog
components. Second, we deliver unique filters to customer-supplied specifications, which we design and fabricate on a customized basis.
Finally, we offer our models and design kits for our customers to design their own filters utilizing our proprietary technology. 

1 

We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for commercialization
of our technology on a continuous basis because our business model involves materials and solid-state device technology development and
engineering of catalog and custom filter design solutions. To succeed across our combined portfolio of Akoustis, XBAW, and RFMi products,
we must convince customers in a wide range of industries including mobile phone OEMs, RFFE module manufacturers, network infrastructure
OEMs, Wi-Fi CPE OEMs, medical device makers, automotive and defense customers to use our products in their systems and modules. For example,
since there are two dominant BAW filter suppliers in the industry that have high-band technology, and both utilize such technology as
a competitive advantage at the module level, we expect customers that lack access to high-band filter technology will be open to engage
with our company for XBAW filters. 

To help drive our XBAW filter business, we plan to continue to pursue
RF filter design and R D development agreements and potentially joint ventures with target customers and other strategic partners,
although we cannot guarantee we will be successful in these efforts. These types of arrangements may subsidize technology development
costs and qualification, filter design costs, and offer complementary technology and market intelligence and other avenues to revenue.
However, we intend to retain ownership of our core XBAW technology, intellectual property, designs, and related improvements. Across our
combined portfolio of Akoustis, XBAW, and RFMi products, as resources permit, we expect to continue development of catalog designs for
multiple customers and to offer such catalog products in multiple sales channels. 

Recent Developments 

On April 3, 2024, we announced two new bandedge
RF filter products for Wi-Fi Automotive and Access Point applications. These filters are expected to ramp into production in the second
half of calendar year 2024. 

On April 8, 2024, we announced that our high-performance narrowband
patented XBAW filters are being designed into a new program with an enterprise-class original equipment manufacturer (OEM). 

On May 1, 2024, we announced two design wins with a Tier-1 Network
Infrastructure customer for two Wi-Fi 7 fixed wireless access enterprise and home gateway platforms. 

On May 17, 2024, after a trial in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Delaware (the District Court in the matter of Qorvo Inc. vs. Akoustis Technologies, Inc. DE Case
1:21-cv-01417-JPM (the Qorvo Litigation ), a jury verdict was entered in favor of plaintiff, Qorvo Inc. Qorvo ),
and against the Company. Although several of Qorvo s claims were either withdrawn or dismissed before or during trial, or decided
by the jury in the Company s favor, the jury found that the Company was unjustly enriched by the willful misappropriation of certain
Qorvo trade secrets and that certain accused products infringed U.S. Patent Nos. 7,522,018 and 9,735,755. The Company believes that its
XBAW products incorporating previously disclosed design updates are not affected by this verdict. The jury awarded Qorvo approximately
 38.6 million in damages. 

On May 22, 2024, we announced the final release
to manufacturing of design updates across our product portfolio which removed any patent features claimed by Qorvo in U.S. Patent Nos.
7,522,018 and 9,735,755. 

On June 27, 2024, we announced that we received 2 million in volume
orders for Wi-Fi 7 program from a Tier-1 carrier in their Tri-Band 4x4 MIMO router. 

On July 9, 2024, we announced an 8 million volume XBAW order
with a Tier-1 customer to be used in their Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 Access Points. 

On August 13, 2024, we announced an additional
purchase order for 13 million XBAW filters from our existing Tier-1 customer for use in their Wi-Fi Access Points raising production
commitments to greater than 21 million, plus a customer option to increase order quantities. 

On September 9, 2024, the District Court issued
an Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiff s Motion for Attorneys Fees (the Attorneys Fees Order ).
The Attorneys Fees Order awarded Qorvo approximately 11.7 million in attorneys fees (the Attorneys Fees Award ). 

On September 10, 2024, the District Court issued
an Order on Pre- and Post-Judgment Interest (the Judgment Interest Order and, together with the Attorneys Fees Order,
the Orders ). The Judgment Interest Order awarded Qorvo approximately 7.3 million (the Judgment Interest Award 
and, collectively with the Damages Award and the Attorneys Fees Award, the Awards ). 

The Orders are not enforceable or appealable;
instead, the Awards will be included in the District Court s final judgment, which will also reflect the outcome of the Post-Trial
Motions and Qorvo s other post-trial motions. Once the District Court renders its final judgment, the Defendants and Qorvo will
have thirty days within which to challenge it (including the Awards) by filing a notice of appeal. If the Company elects to appeal the
final judgment and posts an undertaking (such as an appeal bond) within thirty days of entry of final judgment, the Awards would not be
enforceable pending the exhaustion of all appeals.

Financing 

We have not achieved profitability from operations,
and so have funded our operations largely with issuances of equity and debt securities, as well as development contracts, RF filter and
production orders, government grants, MEMS foundry services (which we exited in 2021) and engineering services. We have historically incurred
losses which are primarily the result of material and processing costs associated with developing and commercializing our technology,
as well as personnel costs, professional fees (primarily accounting and legal), and other general and administrative G A expenses. We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for the commercialization of our technology on a continuous basis because our
business model involves materials and solid-state device technology development and engineering of catalog and custom filter design solutions. 

On May 17, 2024, the jury in the Qorvo Litigation awarded Qorvo approximately
 38.6 million in damages. On September 9 and 10, 2024, the District Court issued orders awarding Qorvo an aggregate of approximately 19.0
million in attorneys fees and pre- and post-judgment interest (collectively, the Awards ). Although, as of the date
of this Report, the District Court has not entered a final judgment in respect of the jury verdict in the Qorvo Litigation, and Akoustis
may elect to appeal such final judgment and the Awards, these matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we elect not to appeal an adverse final judgment or the Awards, or if we are unable to post an undertaking (such
as an appeal bond) to enable us to do so, we will likely be forced to pursue a reorganization proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. 

Except for the Company s ATM Sales Agreement
with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC and Roth Capital Partners, LLC, with respect to which the sales agents are under no obligation to
sell any shares of Common Stock and the use of which may depend on market conditions, the Company has no commitments or arrangements
to obtain any additional funds, and there can be no assurance such funds will be available on acceptable terms or at all. 

Recent Financing Activity 

Registered Direct Offering of Common Stock
and Pre-Funded Warrants 

On May 22, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement
and placement agency agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC Roth to issue and sell an aggregate of 10,500,000 shares
of its Common Stock, and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 39,500,000 shares of Common Stock in a registered direct offering. The
offering price was 0.20 per share and 0.199 per pre-funded warrant. Under the placement agency agreement, the Company agreed to pay
the Placement Agent an aggregate cash fee equal to 6.0 of the aggregate gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the securities
and to reimburse the placement agent for up to 50,000 of expenses. The closing of the offering occurred on May 24, 2024. Gross proceeds
were approximately 10.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The prefunded
warrants were treated as equity and are included in Additional paid in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet included in this Report.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, 8.5 million pre-funded warrants were exercised. 

Underwritten Offering of Common Stock

Our XBAW Filter Technology and Business 

Current RF acoustic wave filters utilize piezoelectric
material physical properties, the resonator device structure and the manufacturing process technology. Existing BAW filters use an acoustic
wave ladder that is based on a monolithic topology approach using polycrystalline materials. 

XBAW technology encompasses cutting-edge polycrystalline, single-crystal
and other high purity piezoelectric materials, which are fabricated into bulk-mode, acoustic wave resonators and RF filters. Our innovative
piezoelectric materials contain high-purity Group III element nitride materials and possess a unique signature, which can be detected
by conventional material metrology tools. We utilize analytical modeling techniques to aid in the design and internal manufacturing of
our materials, whereby the raw substrate materials utilized in our XBAW process are sourced from a third party. Once our filter designs
are simulated and ready to manufacture, we supply the NY Facility raw materials, a mask design file, and a unique process sequence to
fabricate our resonators and filters. We hold many issued and pending patents on our XBAW wafer process flow, which is compatible with
wafer level packaging (WLP) that allows for low-profile, cost- effective filters to be produced. 

Technological Challenges Facing the Mobile
Device Industry 

Rising consumer demand for always-on wireless broadband
connectivity creates an unprecedented need for high performance RFFE modules for mobile devices. Mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets
and wearables are quickly becoming the primary means of accessing the Internet and driving the Internet of Things (IoT). Rapid growth
in mobile data traffic tests the limits of existing wireless bandwidth. Carriers and regulators have responded by opening new spectrums
of RF frequencies, driving up the number of frequency bands in mobile devices. This substantial increase in frequency bands has created
a demand for more filters, as well as a demand for filters with higher selectivity. The global transition to LTE and adoption of LTE-Advanced
with more sophisticated carrier aggregation and multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) techniques has continued to push the requirements
for increased supply of high-performance filters. Furthermore, the introduction of 5G mobile technologies and their associated frequencies
has created an even greater need for high-performance, high-frequency filters as the bands being auctioned have primarily been in the
3-6 GHz range, well above the frequencies of current networks. 

The new spectrum introduced by 4G/LTE and 5G
is driving spectrum licensing at higher frequencies than previous 3G smartphone models. For example, new TDD LTE frequencies allocated
for 5G wireless cover frequencies nearly twice as high as those covered in previous generation phones. As a result, the demand for filters
represents the single largest opportunity in the RFFE industry, according to a Mobile Experts 2022 report. For traditional low
band frequencies, SAW filters have been the primary choice, while high band solutions have utilized BAW filters due to their performance
and yield. While there are multiple sources of supply for SAW technology, the source of supply for BAW filters is more limited and essentially
dominated by two manufacturers worldwide. See Competition below. 

In addition, signal loss of current generation
acoustic wave filters is excessively high, and up to half of the transmit power is wasted as heat, which ultimately constrains battery
life. Another challenge is that the allocated spectrum for mobile communication bands requires high bandwidth RF filters, which, in turn,
requires wide bandwidth core resonator technology. In addition, filters with inferior selectivity either reduce the number or bandwidth
of operating bands the mobile device can support or increase the noise in the operating bands. Each of these problems negatively impacts
the end-user s experience when using the mobile device. 

The RFFE must meet growing data demands while
reducing cost and improving battery life. Our solution involves a new approach to RFFE component manufacturing, enabled by XBAW technology.
We expect our XBAW technology to produce filters that will reduce the overall system cost and improve performance of the RFFE.

Our XBAW Filter Solutions 

Our XBAW filter business is focused on the commercialization of wide
bandwidth RF filters operating in the high frequency spectrum known as the sub 8 GHz bands. Using our XBAW technology, we believe these
filters enable new power amplifier duplexer (PAD) module or RFFE competition for high band modules as well as performance-driven low band
applications. Initially, we expect to target select strategic RFFE market leaders as well as tier two mobile phone OEMs and/or RFFE module
suppliers. Longer term, the focus of our XBAW filter business will be to expand our market share by engaging with additional mobile phone
OEMs and RFFE module manufacturers. We manufacture our XBAW wafers in our Canandaigua, NY fabrication facility where we continue to focus
on the commercialization of our filters using our XBAW technology. We plan to continue, as resources permit, to develop a series of filter
designs to be used in the manufacturing of discrete filters, duplexers or more complex multiplexers targeting the 4G/LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi, automotive
and defense frequency bands. We believe our filter designs will create an alternative for, and replace, filters currently manufactured
using materials with fundamentally inferior performance. Figure 1 below illustrates characterization plots that represent the high power,
high bandwidth and high frequency capability of our high purity piezoelectric materials. 

Figure 1-Characteristics of our high purity
piezoelectric materials used to fabricate our BAW RF filters. 

Single-Band Discrete Designs, Duplexers
and Multiplexers 

SAW filters are generally desired in modern RFFE because of their performance,
small size and low cost. However, traditional SAW ladder designs do not perform well in high frequency bands or bands with closely spaced
receive and transmit channels, typical of many new bands. Therefore, BAW filters are preferred for these bands. In the NY Facility, we
fabricate BAW resonators, the building block of BAW filters, that offer high frequency, wide bandwidth and high-power performance. We
believe the improved efficiency provided by BAW filters will reduce the total cost of RFFE modules, offer efficient use of shared frequency
spectrum as well as reduce the battery demand of mobile devices. Additionally, we believe that our XBAW technology will allow for a single
manufacturing method that will support all of the BAW filter band range and a significant portion of the SAW band range. Figure 2 below
illustrates what we believe will be the frequency range of our XBAW technology.

Figure 2- The potential range of our technology. 

Pure-Play Filter Provider Enables New Module
Competition 

Our XBAW and XP3F technology allows for a wide range of frequency coverage,
and we plan to supply XBAW filters that will support frequency bands from 2 to 20+ GHz for 4G/LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi, automotive, timing, defense
and future radio3 FR3 applications. We have successfully demonstrated resonators and filters that will support the design
and fabrication of 5G/LTE filters, Wi-Fi filters and defense filters, with frequencies adjacent to the 5G mobile frequencies, in particular
the N77, N78, and N79 bands. We have transitioned our XBAW technology to high volume manufacturing with the target of being a pure-play
filter supplier that will address the increasing RF complexity placed on RFFE manufacturers. 

Our XP3F technology is expected to enable the
new smart phone and wireless infrastructure requirements for FR3 and SATCOM applications, allowing integration of smaller size and less
weight from the conventional technology. 

Figure 3 illustrates historical and projected growth in RF complexity.

Commercialization of XBAW Filters and Developmental
XP3F Technology 

The immediate focus of our XBAW filter business is on the commercialization
of wide bandwidth RF filters to address the Wi-Fi, Network Infrastructure and Defense bands with innovative single-band designs using
our XBAW sub 8 GHz RF filter technology. We are currently developing commercial single-band XBAW filters through the NY Facility. We are
focused on developing fixed-band XBAW filters because we believe these designs present the greatest near-term potential for commercialization
of our technology. 

Our technology development process consists of
the following five phases: 

1. 
 Pre-Alpha Demonstrate basic feasibility/capabilities 

2. 
 Alpha Develop stable recipe (Process freeze) with limited production
 development 

3. 
 Beta Complete technology qualification (Process qualification)
 in factory to enable product design 

4. 
 Pre-Production Demonstrate lead product production capabilities,
 release final design tools 

5. 
 Production Continual improvement of process and parametric
 performance 

We have completed all phases for our first
generation XBAW process technology called XB1. Additionally, we have received and delivered orders for pre-production products based
on our XBAW process technology, and as of end fiscal 2024, we have shipped more than 97 million XBAW filters to the 5G mobile,
Wi-Fi, 5G infrastructure and defense markets. 

Currently our XP3F technology is in the Beta 
phase, having successfully completed Phase 1 of our contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) COmpact Front
end Filters as the ElEmental level (COFFEE) program as the only commercially viable filter to demonstrate success up to 20GHz. Akoustis
is pursuing further government-funded projects and has been involved in more than 9 subsequent projects that are expected to be awarded
to the selected bidders in the coming months. One of these project submissions is targeted at enabling communications during the Los Angeles
2028 Olympic Games. 

Research and Development 

Since inception, the Company s focus
has been on developing material science that innovates wireless filter technology with a compelling value proposition to our
potential customers and a significant and noticeable impact to the end user. Compared to legacy polycrystalline material (used to
manufacture RF resonators and filters), our patented XBAW technology employs high purity piezoelectric films in our resonators,
which are used as the enabler to create high performance BAW RF filters. Our high purity piezoelectric materials are a key
differentiator when compared to the incumbent amorphous thin-film technologies because they increase the acoustic velocity, the
electromechanical coupling coefficient in the resonator and/or high-power performance. These technology features allow Akoustis to
engineer RF filter solutions for a broad spectrum for multiple radio frequencies and thus multiple end markets. 

Research and development expense totaled 30.0
million for the year ended June 30, 2024, and 33.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. R D activities focused on high purity
piezoelectric materials development and resonator demonstration. Current R D investments include materials advancement, resonator
development, RF filter design, high yield wafer manufacturing and filter packaging. 

As a result of our efforts, we have developed
and introduced multiple new XBAW filters which are currently sampling and in production with multiple customers across multiple markets.
Our focus remains on improving the electromechanical coupling and quality factor of our resonator technology and the performance of our
fabricated filters through design improvements and process optimization experiments. 

Recent Developments in R D 

We concentrated on several products and end markets
in fiscal 2024 including 5G mobile, Wi-Fi, CBRS, SATCOM, defense, and 5G infrastructure. 

Advancements in our Wi-Fi portfolio continued in fiscal 2024. With
the roll out of the Wi-Fi 7 frequency band, 5.17-7.125 GHz, new filters are needed that can operate at high frequency with ultra-wide
bandwidth. This has driven investment in the development of both standard and custom XBAW filters to address this new
market over the past several years. We announced our first two Wi-Fi 6E filters in fiscal 2021, including a 5.5 GHz and 6.5 GHz XBAW 
filter solution with 675 MHz and 1180 MHz of bandwidth. In early fiscal 2022, we entered the Wi-Fi 6E market with our first design win
in August of 2021 for a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) gateway product. 

7 

Figure 4 Wi-Fi 6E and emerging
Wi-Fi 7 channel frequency spectrum 

In early January 2022, we announced the addition of five additional
design wins in Wi-Fi, four in Wi-Fi 6E and one in Wi-Fi 6, bringing the total number of Wi-Fi design wins to thirteen. We added two additional
design wins in April 2022, bringing the total number to fifteen, and we received one additional design win in Wi-Fi 6E in the June 2022
quarter. In October 2022, we announced the addition of three new design wins in Wi-Fi 6E bringing total to nineteen. In May 2023, we announced
the addition of one design win in Wi-Fi 7 and two additional design wins in Wi-Fi 6 bringing total to twenty-two. We are currently sampling
and shipping volume pre-production and production filters with multiple OEMs, ODMs and SoC makers. 

In June 2020, we entered into a strategic purchase
agreement with a tier 1 enterprise-focused Wi-Fi OEM to create customer Wi-Fi 6E XBAW filters for a MU-MIMO enterprise router product.
During fiscal 2021 and 2022, we developed multiple filters for this customer, all of which have been design-locked and successfully completed
qualification in the June 2022 quarter. We entered into production with this customer in the first half of fiscal 2023. 

In April, 2021, we announced that we had developed
two new Wi-Fi 6E XBAW filters, a 5.6 GHz filter and a 6.6 GHz filter. The 5.6 GHz filter module covers the entire UNII 1-4 spectrum and
enables an additional 80 MHz and 160 MHz channel in UNII 4, while the 6.6 GHz filter module covers the UNII 5-8 spectrum. Current Wi-Fi
6E configurations allow for the use of six 80 MHz and three 160 MHz channels in the UNII 1-3 spectrum and fourteen 80 MHz and seven 160
MHz channels in the UNII 5-8 spectrum. The XBAW 5.6/6.6 GHz coexistence filter modules allow for the use of seven 80 MHz and three
160 MHz channels in the UNII 1-4 spectrum and twelve 80 MHz and six 160 MHz channels in the UNII 5-8 spectrum. Given that the 6 GHz portion
of the Wi-Fi 6E standard has begun to experience utilization relatively recently, this new XBAW coexistence solution allows for an
environment of greater capacity in the 5 GHz bands. We received our first order from a tier-1 consumer-focused OEM on the same day we
introduced the filters, with the first order for the development of new multi-user, multiple-in-multiple-out mesh routing products for
the consumer market. In June 2023, we announced the introduction of next generation 5.6 GHz and 6.6 GHz filters with improved performance
in a package greater than 4 times smaller compared to the previous generation of the product. 

During fiscal year 2024, we have released to production a suite of
filters primarily aimed at this new Wi-Fi 7 market that is defined in Figure 5. The XBAW technology is redefining the
capability of our customers as we believe that Akoustis is the only filter supplier currently able to achieve the technical goal of achieving
60dB just 50MHz away from the passband. 

Figure 5 Akoustis WIFI 7 filters 

We had several significant advancements in our
CBRS and 5G mobile infrastructure business during fiscal 2024 with the adoption of N104 and FR3. Since our technology is significantly
smaller and lighter than alternative commercial technologies, XBAW is able to provide comparable performance whilst reducing
installation costs compared with conventional cavity filters. In the June quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered production with three CBRS
infrastructure OEM s, our first production ramps in mobile infrastructure. Also in that quarter, we finished the first phase development
of our new 3.8 GHz filter for the US market. In late calendar 2020, the FCC auctioned frequencies between 3.7 GHz and 3.98 GHz for 5G
mobile use in the United States. Carriers are currently building networks that operate between 3.7 GHz and 3.98 GHz; we are running second
iteration of our filters to address these bands and expect to begin sampling our new 3.8 GHz filter to OEMs in late calendar 2023 for
use in small cell base stations.

In the defense market, we built on our early successes
in phased array radar and drone filters with the award of a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contract to advance XBAW
technology in October of 2020, and the award of a second DARPA contract in April 2022 to advance the Company s XBAW technology to
18 GHz. The first program, a Direct-to-Phase-2 DP2 program, is to facilitate MEMS development, produce novel piezoelectric
materials and device designs for both commercial and defense markets. One of the major outcomes from the DP2 program is to develop a piezo
MEMS PDK for the Company s proprietary and patented XBAW process which is expected to support customer engagements
that leverage the PDK to create devices and circuits, including RF filters, using the XBAW process. Under the second program, the Company
intends to develop a novel mode overtone approach to circumvent trade-offs inherent in traditional BAW frequency scaling approaches. 

Akoustis currently has 12 commercial XBAW
filters in its production and greater than 4 XBAW filters in development. Current product catalog filters include a 5.6 GHz Wi-Fi
filter, a 5.2 GHz Wi-Fi filter, a 5.5 GHz Wi-Fi-6E filter, a 6.5 GHz Wi-Fi 6E filter, three small cell 5G network infrastructure
filters including two Band n77 filters and one Band n79 filter, a 3.8 GHz filter for defense phased-array radar applications, and a
3.6 GHz filter for the CBRS 5G infrastructure market. New developments include standard catalog and custom filters for the sub-7 GHz
bands targeting 5G mobile device, network infrastructure, Wi-Fi CPE, automotive and defense markets. 

Our RFMi Technology and Business 

RFMi is focused on supplying SAW and Xtal based
frequency components to automotive, industrial IoT, medical, telecom, consumer, and other markets. The team designs, develops and markets
under RFMi-branded SAW band pass filters, notch filters, diplexers, duplexers, resonators and delay lines, as well as Xtal resonators,
temperature sensing Xtal resonators, temperature compensated crystal oscillators TCXO ), voltage controlled temperature
compensated crystal oscillators VCTCXO ), crystal oscillators XO ), voltage controlled crystal oscillators VCXO ), oven controlled crystal oscillators OCXO and Xtal filters, etc. 

Technological Challenges Facing Customers
for RFMi-branded Solutions 

While wireless spectrum expands to above 3GHz
where Akoustis XBAW products are focused, the spectrum under 3GHz is also becoming more and more crowded. Customers are losing guard
bands next to their operating spectrum to competing applications and operators, and co-existence has become necessary
for functionality for wireless electronics. LTE applications increasingly need to co-exist with Industrial, Scientific, and Medical ISM band applications, satellite signals are interfered by terrestrial signals, industrial wireless control signals are saturated by communication
signals, even medical wireless signals can be interrupted by other RF power outputs. The more traditional filtering technologies, like
L-C (inductor capacitor) and ceramic filters, may not have a Q factor high enough to supply steep roll-off from passband to rejection
band. On the other hand, the demand for available data has also exploded, due to the increasing speed of data transmission and digital
communication, which requires faster and more accurate piezo-ceramic resonators. 

Our RFMi-branded Solutions for the RFMi
Customers 

RFMi is addressing jamming and high data rate
problems by focusing on frequency components and supplying diverse and flexible SAW and Xtal products. In its operation spectrum (about
30MHz to 3GHz), SAW technology offers one of the highest Q factors. RFMi provides custom and standard SAW band pass filters to allow
a signal spectrum to pass while rejecting the other signals, as well as a SAW diplexer with one input and two output, SAW duplexers that
transmit and receive simultaneously for Frequency Division Duplex FDD applications, and SAW resonators for high frequency
transmitters, as well as custom delay lines. For Xtal products, instead of only supplying standard Xtal resonators at a few frequencies,
RFMi provides a family of Xtal products and supports custom designs to accommodate a wider temperature range than standard products,
stable frequency, and low jitter and phase noise. 

Our GDSI Services and Business 

GDSI supplies advanced back-end wafer processing and
supply chain services to over 250 customers across multiple industries including automotive, IoT, defense, medical, optical and communications.

Raw Materials 

Within its internal manufacturing operation for
XBAW filters, Akoustis sources raw materials, process gases, metals and other miscellaneous supplies to fabricate its BAW RF filter circuits.
Materials range from substrates (used to deposit key piezoelectric materials) to standard dielectric-based laminates (used for packaging
of the RF filter circuits). The Company sources at least two types of substrate materials for its BAW process and we have more than
one supplier for one material and a single source for the other. Multiple process gases are used for material synthesis, process etching
and wafer treatment. While there is more than one supplier for most process gases, the purity levels of such gases may change by source.
Hence, either purification or process requalification may be required when purchasing from a second source is required. Akoustis sources
various high purity metals for electrode formation and interconnect layers for its RF circuits. Such metals are available in various
purity levels and are available from more than one supplier. Other process handling hardware common to the semiconductor industry is
available in abundance from multiple suppliers. Consistent with other semiconductor manufacturers, the Company may have to work with
all its suppliers to ensure adequate supply of raw materials, process gases and metals as the Company ramps from R D into high volume
manufacturing. 

RFMi Supply Chain 

RFMi mainly relies on its contract manufacturer,
Tai-Saw Technology Co., Ltd. TST to source raw materials, such as different chemicals and gases for front and back-end
manufacturing, quartz, lithium tantalate and certain bonded wafers, metal targets, Xtal blanks, semiconductor IC s, aluminum bonding
wires and flip chip gold stub bump supplies, packages and lids. Most raw materials have dual or multi-sources. However, certain materials,
e.g., high temperature co-fired ceramic HTCC ceramic packages, bonded wafers and automotive grade TCXO/VCTCXO IC s
are single-sourced as there is no alternative supplier or the alternative supplier does not guarantee automotive grade materials. Many
of RFMi s customers are automotive and require a Production Part Approval Process PPAP ), where using an alternative
source may require re-PPAP and take efforts and time. RFMi intends to diversity its supply chain, however, it takes time and resources.
Certain raw material, like HTCC ceramic packages, may not have a second source for the foreseeable future. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of intellectual property
rights, including patents and trade secrets, along with copyrights, trademarks and contractual obligations and restrictions to protect
our core technology and business. 

In
the United States and internationally, as of September 01, 2024, our IP portfolio included 97 patents, including one blocking patent
that we have licensed from Cornell University. Additionally, we have 31 active and pending patent applications. These patents cover our
XBAW RF filter technology from the substrate level through the system application layer. Where possible, we leverage both federal and
state level R D grants to support development and commercialization of our technology. Our owned patents expire between 2034 and
2040. We intend to continue to innovate and expand our patent portfolio, and when appropriate, we will look to purchase license(s) that
grant access to additional intellectual property that enables, enhances or further expands our technical capabilities and/or product. 

We believe that Akoustis has competitive advantages
from rights granted under our patent applications. Some applications, however, may not result in the issuance of any patents. In addition,
any future patent may be opposed, contested, circumvented or designed around by a third party or found to be unenforceable or invalidated.
Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies
or design around patents owned or licensed by us. 

We generally control access to, and use of, our
confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors
and customers. We rely in part on the United States and international copyright laws to protect our intellectual property. All employees
and consultants are required to execute confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements in connection with their employment
and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in
connection with the employment or consulting relationship. 

Competition 

The RF filter market is controlled by a relatively
small number of RF component suppliers. These companies include, among others, Broadcom Corporation, Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Murata ),
Qorvo, Skyworks Solutions Inc., Taiyo Yuden Co. Ltd., and Qualcomm Incorporated. Broadcom Corporation and Qorvo dominate the high band
BAW filter market, controlling a significant portion of the customer base and are increasing capacity to meet the growing RF filter demand
of the 4G/5G cellular market. 

We compete directly with these companies to secure
design slots inside RFFE module targeting companies that procure filters or internally source filters. While many of our competitors have
more resources than we have, we believe that our filter designs will be superior in performance, and we approach prospective customers
as a pure-play filter supplier, offering advantages in performance over the full frequency range at competitive costs. Our challenges
include convincing our customers that we have a strong intellectual property position, we will be able to deliver in volume, we will meet
their price targets, and we can satisfy quality, reliability and other requirements. For a list of other competitive factors, see Item
1A. Risk Factors - We are still developing many of our products, and they may not be accepted in the market. 

10 

The Xtal market is more mature and there are
many players, including Epson, KDS Daishinku, Kyocera, Murata and NDK from Japan and TXC from Taiwan. Our RFMi products are largely focused
on niche markets such as Industrial IoT and professional audio, which may reduce competition with these large, high volume competitors.
In addition, our RFMi products primarily consist of TCXO, VCTCXO and VCXO, instead of low cost Xtal. However, we may still compete with
market participants with more resources and purchasing power than us. 

Employees 

We place an emphasis on hiring the best talent at the right time to
enable our core technology and business growth. This includes establishing a competitive compensation and benefits package, thereby enhancing
our ability to recruit experienced personnel and key technologists. As of June 30, 2024, we had a total of 117 full-time employees. We
will continue to hire specific and targeted positions to further enable our technology and manufacturing capabilities as and when appropriate
and as resources permit. 

Government Regulations 

Our business and products in development are or may
become subject to regulation by various federal and state governmental agencies, including the radio frequency emission regulatory activities
of the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC ), the consumer protection laws of the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ),
the import/export regulatory activities of the Department of Commerce, international traffic in arms regulations (ITAR) administered by
the Department of State, the product safety regulatory activities of the Consumer Products Safety Commission, and the environmental regulatory
activities of the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA ). 

The rules and regulations of the FCC limit the
RF used by, and level of power emitting from, electronic equipment. Our RF filters, as a key element enabling consumer electronic smartphone
equipment, are required to comply with these FCC rules and may require certification, verification or registration of our RF filters
with the FCC. Certification and verification of new equipment requires testing to ensure the equipment s compliance with the FCC s
rules. The equipment must be labeled according to the FCC s rules to show compliance with these rules. Testing, processing of the
FCC s equipment certificate or FCC registration and labeling may increase development and production costs and could delay the
implementation of our XBAW acoustic wave resonator technology for our RF filters and the launch and commercial productions of our filters
into the U.S. market. Electronic equipment permitted or authorized to be used by us through FCC certification or verification procedures
must not cause harmful interference to licensed FCC users, and may be subject to RF interference from licensed FCC users. Selling, leasing
or importing non-compliant equipment is considered a violation of FCC rules and federal law, and violators may be subject to an enforcement
action by the FCC. Any failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the FCC could have an adverse effect on our business,
operating results and financial condition by increasing our compliance costs and/or limiting our sales in the United States. 

Like our XBAW products, RFMi s SAW and
Xtal products are frequency components and are subject to similar FCC rules. For instance, many of RFMi s customers operate in
ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band, MICS (Medical Implant Communication System), WMTS (Wireless Medical Telemetry Service)
and other bands regulated by FCC, in which transmission power level is restricted and products have to pass the FCC, and in certain cases
FDA certification to be allowed in the market. Even though RFMi s components do not need to be certified by FCC and/or FDA, our
customers modules and systems which incorporate RFMi components may need to be certified. Any failure of RFMi s customers to be
certified would affect RFMi s sales. 

The semiconductor and electronics industries
also have been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use
of various substances, a number of which have been used in our products in development or processes. While we have implemented a compliance
program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available
or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted
counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties
and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results. We will continue to monitor our
quality program and expand as required to maintain compliance and ability to audit our supply chain. 

Noncompliance with applicable regulations or
requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits,
fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could require us to pay contractual
damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys fees and costs. These enforcement actions could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil
or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition,
responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management s attention and resources and an increase
in professional fees. 

Recent Legislation 

In August 2022, the Creating Helpful Incentives
to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act (the CHIPS Act was signed into law. The CHIPS Act provides for a 25 refundable
tax credit on certain investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The credit is provided for qualifying property which is placed
in service after December 31, 2022. The CHIPS Act also provides for certain other financial incentives to further investments in domestic
semiconductor manufacturing. The Company recorded an investment tax credit of 3.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

This section is a summary of the risks that we
presently believe are material to the operations of the Company. Additional risks of which we are not presently aware or which we presently
deem immaterial may also impair the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations. 

11 

Risk Factors Summary 

Risks Related to our Financial Condition 

We have a history of operating
losses and will need to raise significant additional capital to continue our business and operations. Additionally, the Qorvo Litigation
resulted in a verdict against the Company, awarding Qorvo approximately 38.6 million in damages, and the District Court has since awarded
Qorvo approximately 11.7 million in attorneys fees and approximately 7.3 million in pre- and post-judgment interest, which has
severely constrained our liquidity. If we are unable to arrange financing in the near term or timely appeal recent judgments and awards
issued by the District Court, we may be forced to seek protection by filing a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code,
which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could cause you to lose all of your investment. 

Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We may be required to identify and evaluate
possible financial and strategic alternatives and their implications for the Company. 

All of our debt obligations will have priority over our Common Stock
with respect to payment in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation dissolution or winding up. 

Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash or Common Stock, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business or have the ability to issue the necessary number of shares of Common Stock to pay our substantial debt. 

Risks Related to our Business and the Industry
in which we Operate 

We have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our business and future prospects. 

We may not generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability. 

We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are not
 able to remediate these material weaknesses appropriately and timely, or if we are unable to implement and maintain effective
 internal control over financial reporting in the future, this could result in losses from errors, harm our reputation or cause
 investors to lose confidence in the reported financial information. 

We have recently engaged, and may in the future engage, in acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our shareholders and harm our financial condition and operating results. 

We are subject to a number of restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness, which may restrict our business and financing activities. 

Our business, results of operation and financial condition have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by a pandemic, epidemic or other public health emergency. 

The industry and the markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. 

We are still developing many of our products, and they may not be accepted in the market. 

Winning business in the semiconductor industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue. 

We face risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing facility. 

A supply shortage, such as the one recently experienced by the semiconductor
industry, could disrupt normal business activity, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 

The average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future. 

Problems in scaling our manufacturing operations or poor manufacturing yields could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Industry overcapacity could cause us to underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 

We face intense competition, which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of potential market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We contract with a number of large service providers and product companies that have considerable bargaining power, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues. 

We may be subject to risks related to doing business in, and having counterparties based in, foreign countries. 

Economic regulation in China could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 

We depend on a few large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue. 

Global shortages in manufacturing capacities could negatively affect our operations and negatively impact our results of operations. 

Changes in general economic conditions, together with other factors, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry, and our business, therefore, may also experience cyclical fluctuations in the future. 

If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our business. 

12 

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 

If we fail to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property
 rights, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies. 

We have a limited number of patent applications, which may not result
 in issued patents or patents that fully protect our intellectual property. 

We are and may in the future be involved in lawsuits to protect or
 enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. 

We need to protect our trademark rights and disclosure of our trade
 secrets to prevent competitors from taking advantage of our goodwill. 

Development of certain technologies with our customers or manufacturers
 may result in restrictions on jointly-developed intellectual property. 

We are and may be subject to claims of infringement, misappropriation
 or misuse of third party intellectual property that, regardless of merit, could result in significant expense and loss of our intellectual
 property rights. 

Risks Related to Regulatory Requirements 

Government regulation may adversely affect our business. 

We may incur substantial expenses in connection with regulatory requirements, and any regulatory compliance failure could cause our business to suffer. 

There could be an adverse change or increase in the laws and/or regulations governing our business. 

Investment Risks 

Our common stock has been thinly traded and its share price in the
 public markets has experienced, and may in the future experience, extreme volatility. 

Stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests because
 of the future issuance of additional shares of our stock or other securities. 

General Risk Factors 

Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our proprietary
 information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. 

Litigation or legal proceedings, including product liability claims,
 could expose us to significant liabilities, occupy a significant amount of our management s time and attention and damage our
 reputation. 

There could be an adverse change or increase in the laws and/or regulations
 governing our business. 

Risks Related to our Financial Condition 

We have a history of operating losses and
will need to raise significant additional capital to continue our business and operations. Additionally, the Qorvo Litigation resulted
in a verdict against the Company, awarding Qorvo approximately 38.6 million in damages, and the District Court has since awarded Qorvo
approximately 11.7 million in attorneys fees and approximately 7.3 million in pre- and post-judgment interest, which has severely
constrained our liquidity. If we are unable to arrange financing in the near term, or to timely appeal the verdict and fee awards, we
will be forced to seek protection by filing a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, which would have a material adverse
effect on our business and could cause you to lose all of your investment. 

We are experiencing financial and operating challenges.
As of June 30, 2024, we had 24.4 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 84.4 million of current liabilities, resulting in
negative working capital. Current liabilities include a litigation related contingent liability in respect of an adverse judgment against
the Company in the Qorvo Litigation awarding Qorvo approximately 38.6 million in damages and subsequently issued orders awarding Qorvo
approximately 11.7 million in attorneys fees and approximately 7.3 million in pre- and post-judgment interest. The verdict in
the Qorvo Litigation together with the related awards have created significant uncertainty regarding the Company s financial condition
and prospects. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the verdict and the related awards on its business, results of operations,
and financial condition; however, depending on both (i) the outcome of the Company s post-trial motions and the District Court s
final judgment and (ii) the Company s ability to arrange any financing or to timely appeal the District Court s judgment and
awards, which may require the Company s posting an undertaking (such as an appeal bond), the Company will be required to seek protection
under applicable bankruptcy laws. 

13 

Factors that could limit our ability to raise
additional capital include, among other matters: 

the expectation that we will be forced to pursue a reorganization proceeding
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; 

the expectation that we will continue to incur losses and generate negative cash flows from operations; 

our substantially limited liquidity and capital resources to meet our obligations as they become due; 

the potential that our
common stock will be delisted by Nasdaq in the event we fail to regain compliance in a timely manner with the minimum bid price requirement
and maintain compliance with other listing requirements; 

the amounts outstanding
under our 44.0 million principal amount of our 6.0 Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the convertible notes and a 4.0
million promissory note issued in connection with our acquisition of GDSI (including the potential we may experience one or more defaults
or events of default under such instruments); and 

the other risks and uncertainties described in this Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 

Any inability to raise adequate funds on commercially
reasonable terms and in the near term or to timely appeal the District Court s judgment and awards would force us to seek protection
by filing a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, resulting in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment. 

Our independent registered public accounting
firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company s historical financial statements
have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm
has issued a report that included an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity financing or other capital
or to timely appeal the District Court s judgment and awards. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. However, if adequate funds are not available to us when we need them, we will be forced to
file a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code and may be required to cease or curtail our operations, raising substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

It may be necessary for us to pursue financial
and strategic alternatives and their implications for the Company and its stockholders are uncertain. 

We are in the process of identifying and evaluating
possible financial and strategic alternatives and their implications for the Company. No assurance can be given as to whether any particular
financial or strategic alternative will be undertaken, and if so, upon what terms or conditions. We may not have enough available cash
to pursue a strategic restructuring, refinancing, or other transaction, and may have to file for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy, whether Chapter
11 or Chapter 7, could result in significant decrease in value for all stockholders. In addition, if we file for bankruptcy, it may cause
disruption in supply from critical vendors required to continue operations, negatively impact sales orders and collections from customers
and negatively impact employee relations. 

All of our debt obligations will have priority
over our Common Stock with respect to payment in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation dissolution or winding up and the convertible
notes may be accelerated upon certain events of default. 

In any bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company, shares of Common Stock would rank in right of payment or distribution below all debt claims against us. As
a result, holders of Common Stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or distribution in respect of their shares prior to the
discharge of all debt claims against us. As a result, holders of shares of Common Stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or
other distribution of assets in the event of a bankruptcy or upon a liquidation or dissolution until after all of our obligations to our
debt holders. Accordingly, holders of Common Stock may lose their entire investment in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Company. 

Additionally, the indenture governing our 44.0
million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes includes certain events of default, the occurrence of which enables the convertible
note holders to declare all of the convertible notes to be due and payable immediately. These events of defaults include, among other
things, (i) the Common Stock not being listed on an exchange such as the Nasdaq Capital Market and (ii) a final judgment or judgments
for the payment of money being entered by a court in an aggregate amount exceeding 10.0 million and such judgments remain undischarged,
unpaid or unstayed for a period of 60 days. As described below under the risk factor titled Our failure to meet the minimum
bid price for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market could adversely affect our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities
and the liquidity of our common stock, and could result in the delisting of our Common Stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market. ,
we have received a notice from Nasdaq s Listings Qualifications Department that it had determined to delist the Common Stock. While
we have requested a hearing in respect of the delisting determination, there can be no assurance that Nasdaq will grant the Company any
compliance period. As a result, our Common Stock may be delisting, constituting an event of default under the convertible notes. Furthermore,
the District Court has issued awards in an aggregate amount of 19.0 million and is expected to issue a final judgment in respect of the
jury award of approximately 38.6 million in the Qorvo Litigation. Once the final judgment is rendered by the District Court, the Company
will have 30 days within which to challenge it (during which time the judgment and related awards are automatically stayed). However,
if the Company does not timely appeal the judgment and awards, since they aggregate in excess of 10.0 million, they would constitute
an event of default under the convertible notes if they remain undischarged, unpaid or unstayed for a period of 60 days following expiration
of the 30-day appeal period. 

14 

Servicing our debt requires a significant
amount of cash or Common Stock, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business or have the ability to issue the necessary
number of shares of Common Stock to pay our substantial debt. 

We have incurred 44.0 million of indebtedness
pursuant to convertible notes issued in June 2022 and have issued a 4.0 million promissory note in connection with our acquisition of
GDSI. This level of debt could have significant consequences on future operations, including: 

increasing
our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; 

making
it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations; 

making
it more difficult to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other
purposes; 

requiring
the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of
cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures; 

placing
us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital than we have;
and 

limiting
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. 

Accrued interest on our 6.0 Convertible Senior
Notes due 2027 is payable semi-annually in cash or freely tradable shares of Common Stock. Our ability to make scheduled payments of interest
depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business
may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt in cash and make necessary capital expenditures. 

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow
to satisfy payment obligations under our convertible notes, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets
or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities
or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. If we determine to pay the
interest in shares of Common Stock, it could materially dilute our current stockholders. 

Our ability to raise capital may be materially
adversely impacted by economic and geopolitical uncertainties. 

A sustained disruption in the capital markets
from economic and geopolitical uncertainties such as conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, pandemics such as COVID-19, bank failures,
inflation, recession, or higher interest rates could negatively impact our ability to raise capital. In the past, we have financed our
operations primarily by the issuance of equity and debt securities. However, we cannot predict if such economic and geopolitical uncertainties
will impact the capital markets or if we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us. Such macro-economic disruptions
may disrupt our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations in the future, which could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and prospects, and could ultimately cause our business to fail. 

Risks Related to our Business and the Industry
in which we Operate 

We have a limited operating history upon
which investors can evaluate our business and future prospects. 

We are an emerging commercial company that began meaningful
commercial operations in 2019 by selling advanced single-crystal BAW filter products for RFFEs for use in the mobile wireless device industry.
Historically, we have primarily focused on R D of high efficiency acoustic wave resonator technology utilizing single-crystal piezoelectric
materials, and have not become profitable from operations. 

Since our expectations of potential customers
and future demand for our products are based on only limited experience, it is difficult for our management and our investors to accurately
forecast and evaluate our future prospects and our revenues. Our proposed progression of our operations is therefore subject to all of
the risks inherent in light of the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the growth
of any new business and the development of a product, as well as those risks that are specific to our business in particular. The risks
include, but are not limited to, our reliance on third parties to complete some processes for the manufacturing and packaging of our
products, the possibility that we will not be able to develop functional and scalable products, or that although functional and scalable,
our products and/or services will not be accepted in the market. To successfully introduce and market our products at a profit, we must
establish brand name recognition and competitive advantages for our products. There are no assurances that the Company can successfully
address these challenges. If it is unsuccessful, the Company and its business, financial condition and operating results will be materially
and adversely affected. 

We may not generate sufficient revenues
to achieve profitability. 

We have incurred operating losses since our inception
and expect to continue to have negative cash flow from operations. We have only generated minimal revenues from shipment of product while
our primary sources of funds have been R D grants, MEMS foundry services (which we exited in 2021), issuances of our equity, and
debt. Our future profitability will depend on our ability to create a sustainable business model and generate sufficient revenues, which
is subject to a number of factors, including our ability to successfully implement our strategies and execute our R D plan, our ability
to implement our improved design and cost reductions into manufacturing of our RF filters, the availability of funding, market acceptance
of our products, consumer demand for end products incorporating our products, our ability to compete effectively in a crowded field,
our ability to respond effectively to technological advances by timely introducing our new technologies and products, and global economic
and political conditions. 

15 

Our future profitability also depends on our
expense levels, which are influenced by a number of factors, including the resources we devote to developing and supporting our projects
and potential products, the continued progress of our research and development of potential products, our ability to improve R D
efficiencies, license fees or royalties we may be required to pay, and the potential need to acquire licenses to new technology, the
availability of intellectual property for licensing or acquisition, or the use of our technology in new markets, which could require
us to pay unanticipated license fees and royalties in connection with these licenses. 

Our development and commercialization efforts
may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues to offset higher expenses. These
expenses, among other things, may cause our net income and working capital to decrease. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue and
manage our expenses, we may never achieve profitability, which would adversely and materially affect our ability to provide a return
to our investors. 

We have identified a material weakness in
our internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to remediate this material weakness appropriately and timely, or if
we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, this could result in losses
from errors, harm our reputation or cause investors to lose confidence in the reported financial information, all or any of which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market
price of our Common Stock, our access to debt or other capital markets or other aspects of our business, prospects, results of operations
or financial condition. 

As a public company, we are required to maintain
internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. 

As discussed further in Item 9A, Controls
and Procedures, we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the
design and implementation of access security and program change management controls for certain financially relevant systems that ensure
appropriate access to data and adequate system changes. We describe the specific issues leading to these conclusions in Item 9A, Controls
and Procedures Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

The actions we are taking to remediate the material
weaknesses may be insufficient and we may in the future discover other areas of our internal controls that need improvement. If we have
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements
may be materially misstated. Additionally, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective
or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting, we may not be able to access debt markets, equity investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness
of our financial reports and the market price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to investigations
by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. 

We have recently engaged, and may in the
future engage, in acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our shareholders and harm our financial condition and
operating results. 

In October 2021, we acquired a majority ownership
position in RFMi and, on April 29, 2022, exercised the right to acquire the remaining 49 . In January 2023, we acquired all of the outstanding
capital stock of GDSI. The consideration for the acquisitions included cash, Common Stock and a secured promissory note. We may in the
future make additional acquisitions of, or investments in, companies that we believe have products or capabilities that are a strategic
or commercial fit with our current business or otherwise offer opportunities for our company. In connection with these acquisitions or
investments, we may: 

issue Common Stock or other forms of equity that would dilute our existing
shareholders percentage of ownership, 

incur debt and assume liabilities, and 

incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets or incur large
 and immediate write-offs. 

We may not be able to complete acquisitions on
favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete an acquisition, such as of RFMi and GDSI, we cannot assure you that it will ultimately strengthen
our competitive position, that it will be viewed positively by customers, financial markets or investors or that we will otherwise realize
the expected benefits of such an acquisition to the anticipated extent or at all. Furthermore, the acquisitions of RFMi and GDSI and any
future acquisitions could pose numerous additional risks to our expected operations, including, but not limited to: 

problems integrating the purchased business, products or technologies, 

challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other
 anticipated benefits, 

increases to our expenses, 

the assumption of significant liabilities, which may have been previously
 unknown or not discoverable through diligence, that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial
 resources of any indemnifying party, 

16 

inability to maintain relationships with prospective key customers,
 vendors and other business partners of the acquired businesses, 

diversion of management s attention from its day-to-day responsibilities, 

difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during
 the transition and integration, 

entrance into marketplaces where we have no or limited prior experience
 and where competitors have stronger marketplace positions, 

potential stockholder litigation challenging the acquisition, which could result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability, 

potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired
 entity, and 

historical financial information may not be representative or indicative
 of our results as a combined company. 

Acquisitions may also have unanticipated tax,
legal, regulatory and accounting ramifications, including recording goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are
subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges and incurring amortization expenses
related to certain intangible assets. 

We have recorded, and may record in the
future, goodwill and intangible and long-lived assets as a result of acquisitions and other investments, and changes in future business
conditions have caused, and in the future could cause, these assets to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that reduces
our operating income. 

As a result of our acquisitions of RFMi and GDSI, we recorded approximately
 14.6 million of goodwill and 17.7 million of intangible assets. Furthermore, the carrying value of our long-lived assets is based on
certain assumptions and estimates regarding their fair value. GAAP rules require us to test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment
on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived
assets, including property and equipment, when there are indications that the assets might be impaired. As described in Note 3 to the
financial statements included with this Report, during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company observed continuing declines in its
stock price, which led it to determine that a triggering event had occurred and therefore the Company performed a quantitative test for
its two reporting units, which led to a goodwill impairment charge of approximately 8.1 million. Additionally, the Company recorded an
impairment charge against its property plant and equipment of 35.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 reflecting the
difference between the carrying amount of the assets and their fair value. 

We are subject to a number of restrictive
covenants relating to our indebtedness, which may restrict our business and financing activities. 

The indenture governing our convertible notes
imposes operating and other restrictions on us. Such restrictions may affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things,
our ability to: 

incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; 

issue preferred stock or stock of any subsidiary; 

make investments or acquisitions; 

merge, consolidate, dissolve or liquidate; 

engage in certain asset sales (including the sale of stock of our subsidiary); 

grant liens (except permitted liens); 

pay dividends; 

engage in transactions with our affiliates; and 

enter into a new line of business. 

The restrictions in the indenture governing the
convertible notes may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interests of our business, and may make it
difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted.
We also may incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and
operational flexibility. Our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will largely depend on the pricing of our products
and services, and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers
or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements. The breach of any of these covenants
and restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the convertible notes, which could result in an acceleration
of our indebtedness. 

17 

Our
business, results of operation and financial condition have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by a pandemic, epidemic
or other public health emergency. 

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact
on worldwide economic activity and caused disruptions in our supply chain and distribution networks as well as sales activity. Another
pandemic, including a new COVID-19 variant, or other public health emergency, together with preventative measures taken to contain or
mitigate such crises, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial conditions. In addition, a pandemic or other public
health emergency could impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, product and energy
costs, labor supply and costs, and interest rates. Any pandemic or other public health emergency could also amplify the other risks and
uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We cannot reasonably predict the ultimate impact
of any pandemic or other public health emergency, including the extent of any adverse impact on our business, results of operations and
financial condition, which will depend on, among other things, the duration and spread, the impact of governmental regulations that may
be imposed in response, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak, the availability, safety and efficacy
of vaccines, including against emerging variants of the infectious disease, and global economic conditions. 

Our sales efforts typically function by in-person
meetings with customers and potential customers to discuss our products. The method and timing of these meetings has been altered due
to stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions relating to COVID-19. This limitation on the ability of our sales personnel to maintain
their customary interaction with customers may negatively affect demand for our products. We have also found that potential customers
have been forced to slow and reprioritize various product development projects as a result of COVID-19. This disruption to our sales
activity and our customers businesses, and the resulting delay in the growth of our business, may have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Furthermore, a reduction or delay in revenues will prolong our dependence
on capital raising to finance our operations. 

The industry and the markets in which the
Company operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Therefore, in order for our products to be competitive
and achieve market acceptance, we need to keep pace with rapid development of new process technologies. 

The markets in which we compete are intensely
competitive. We operate primarily in the industry that designs and produces semiconductor components for wireless communications and
other wireless devices, which is subject to rapid changes in both product and process technologies based on demand and evolving industry
standards. The markets for our products are characterized by: 

rapid technological developments and product evolution, 

rapid changes in customer requirements, 

frequent new product introductions and enhancements, 

continuous demand for higher levels of integration, decreased size
 and decreased power consumption, 

short product life cycles with declining prices over the life cycle
 of the product, and 

evolving industry standards. 

The continuous evolutions of these technologies
and frequent introduction of new products and enhancements have generally resulted in short product life cycles for wireless semiconductor
products, in general, and for RFFEs, in particular. Our R D activity and resulting products could become obsolete or less competitive
sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the above-noted factors. Therefore, in order for
our products to be competitive and achieve market acceptance, we need to keep pace with rapid development of new process technologies,
which requires us to: 

respond effectively to technological advances by timely introducing
 new technologies and products, 

successfully implement our strategies and execute our R D plan
 in practice, 

improve the efficiency of our technology, and 

implement our improved design and cost reductions into manufacturing
 of our RF filters. 

We are still developing many of our products,
and they may not be accepted in the market. 

Although we believe that our XBAW acoustic wave
resonator technology, which utilizes high purity piezoelectric materials, provides material advantages over existing RF filters technologies,
and we have developed and are currently developing various methods of integration suitable for implementation of this technology into
RF filters, we cannot be certain that our RF BAW filters will be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance. While we have fabricated
R D filters that demonstrate the performance of our XBAW technology, and this technology has been qualified for mass production,
the Company is undergoing a critical production ramp to commercial scale. There are no assurances that we can successfully overcome many
of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields. In addition to our limited operating
history, we will depend on a limited number of manufacturers and customers for a significant portion of our revenue in the future and
we cannot guarantee their acceptance of our products. Each of these factors may adversely affect our ability to implement our business
strategy and achieve our business goals. 

18 

The successful development of our XBAW technology
and market acceptance of our RF BAW filters will be highly complex and will depend on the following principal competitive factors, including
our ability to: 

comply with industry standards and effectively compete against current
 technology for producing RF acoustic wave filters, 

differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors by delivering
 RF BAW filters that are higher in quality, reliability and technical performance, 

anticipate customer and market requirements, changes in technology
 and industry standards and timely develop improved technologies that meet high levels of satisfaction of our potential customers, 

maintain, grow and manage our internal teams to the extent we increase
 our operations and develop new segments of our business, 

develop and maintain successful collaborative, strategic, and other
 relationships with manufacturers, customers and contractors, 

protect, develop or otherwise obtain adequate intellectual property
 for our technology and our filters; and 

obtain strong financial, sales, marketing, technical and other resources
 necessary to develop, test, manufacture, commercialize and market our filters. 

If we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these
objectives, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. As a result, our XBAW technology and
our RF filters may not be accepted in the market and we may never attain profitability. 

Winning business in the semiconductor industry
is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue. 

Our business is dependent on us winning competitive
bid selection processes, known as design wins . These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate
significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain
a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result
in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes. 

Winning a product design does not guarantee sales
to a customer. A delay or cancellation of a customer s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we
incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it. In addition, the timing of design wins
is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins at the same time, may strain our resources
and supply chain. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses.
Further, often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturing
line for those products. The qualification process can take significant time and resources. Delays in qualification or failure to qualify
our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue. Finally, customers
could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce
demand for our products, and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and
results of operations. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into which our products
are incorporated, often have very short life cycles. 

We face risks associated with the operation
of our manufacturing facility. 

We operate a wafer fabrication facility in Canandaigua,
NY that we acquired in June 2017. We currently use several international and domestic suppliers to assemble and test our products, as
well as our own test and tape and reel facilities located in the U.S. 

A number of factors related to our facilities
will affect our business and financial results, including the following: 

our ability to adjust production capacity in a timely fashion in response
 to changes in demand for our products; 

the significant fixed costs of operating the facilities; 

factory utilization rates; 

our ability to qualify our facilities for new products and new technologies
 in a timely manner; 

the availability of raw materials, the impact of the volatility of
 commodity pricing and tariffs imposed on raw materials, including substrates, gold, platinum and high purity source materials such
 as gallium, aluminum, arsenic, indium, silicon, phosphorous and palladium; 

our manufacturing cycle times; 

our manufacturing yields; 

our ability to hire, train and manage qualified production personnel; 

our compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations;
 and 

our ability to avoid prolonged periods of down-time in our facilities
 for any reason. 

19 

We are dependent upon third parties for
the supply of raw materials and components. 

Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining
adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost, including silicon wafers,
copper lead frames, precious and rare earth metals, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. Although we maintain relationships
with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials
and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components,
as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able
to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality
specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost. If a supplier were unable to meet
our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability
to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of
raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or
terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material
or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on
a limited number of sole-source suppliers. If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect
on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. As certain materials are highly specialized, the lead time needed
to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source. To the extent
we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply
arrangements would be exacerbated. 

The ongoing supply
shortage experienced by the semiconductor industry has disrupted and will likely continue to disrupt normal business activity, and may
have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 

The global silicon semiconductor industry is experiencing a shortage
in supply and difficulties in ability to meet customer demand. These issues have led to an increase in lead-times of the production of
semiconductor chips and components. 

We have experienced,
and expect to continue to experience, disruption to parts of our semiconductor supply chain, including procuring necessary components
and inputs, such as wafers and substrates, in a timely fashion, with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation
and raising prices. We have also incurred higher costs to secure available inventory, or have extended our purchase commitments or placed
non-cancellable orders with suppliers, which introduces inventory risk if our forecasts and assumptions are inaccurate. In addition,
disruptions to commercial transportation infrastructure have increased delivery times for materials and components to our facilities
and, in some cases, our ability to timely ship our products to customers. We have seen some of our customers become more conservative
in response to these complications by reducing their purchases and inventories or postponing capital expenditures, including product
orders from us. 

Social and environmental responsibility
regulations, policies and provisions, as well as customer and investor demands, may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely
affect our relationships with customers and investors. 

There is an increasing focus on corporate, social
and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry, particularly with OEMs that manufacture consumer electronics. A number
of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements
that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions.
An increasing number of investors are also requiring companies to disclose corporate, social and environmental policies, practices and
metrics. In addition, various jurisdictions are developing climate change-based laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional
direct costs for compliance, as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance
costs that are passed on to us. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as investor expectations, on corporate environmental
and social responsibility practices and disclosure, are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for
us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing. If we are unable to comply,
or are unable to cause our suppliers or manufacturers to comply, with such policies or provisions or meet the requirements of our customers
and investors, a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares, and may take legal action against
us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations. 

In recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders,
regulators and the public in general on corporate, social and environmental matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related
risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain,
human rights, and social responsibility. We may be unable to satisfactorily meet evolving standards, regulations and disclosure requirements
related to corporate, social, and environmental matters. Such matters can affect the willingness or ability of investors to make an investment
in our Company, as well as our ability to meet regulatory requirements, including the SEC s proposed rules related to greenhouse
gas emissions. Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations, additional regulations and industry standards
or achieve our corporate, social, and environmental responsibility goals could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition, or stock price. 

In addition, as part of their corporate, social
and environmental responsibility programs, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced
from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts, such as in the Democratic Republic
of Congo. This could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices,
including our products. As a result, we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers demands, which may harm our sales and
operating results. 

20 

The average selling prices of semiconductor
products in our markets have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future, which could harm our revenue and gross profit. 

Certain of the semiconductor products we develop
and sell are used for high volume applications. As a result, the prices of those products have often decreased rapidly. Gross profit
on our products may be negatively affected by, among other things, pricing pressures from our customers. We have reduced, and may in
the future reduce, the average selling prices of our products in response to, or in anticipation of, future competitive pricing pressures,
new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors. In addition, some of our customer agreements provide for volume-based
pricing and product pricing roadmaps, which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time. Our margins and financial
results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, reducing
manufacturing costs, or developing new and higher value-added products on a timely basis. 

If we experience poor manufacturing yields,
our operating results may suffer. 

Our products have unique designs and are fabricated
using multiple semiconductor process technologies that are highly complex. In many cases, our products are assembled in customized packages.
Many of our products consist of multiple components in a single module and feature enhanced levels of integration and complexity. Our
customers insist that our products be designed to meet their exact specifications for quality, performance and reliability. Our manufacturing
yield is a combination of yields across the entire supply chain, including wafer fabrication, assembly and test yields. Defects in a
single component in an assembled module product can impact the yield for the entire module, which means the adverse economic impacts
of an individual defect can be multiplied many times over if we fail to discover the defect before the module is assembled. Due to the
complexity of our products, we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields and other quality issues, particularly
with respect to new products. 

Our customers test our products once they have
been assembled into their products. The number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of
many factors, including: 

design errors; 

minute impurities and variations in materials used; 

contamination of the manufacturing environment; 

equipment failure or variations in the manufacturing processes; 

losses from broken wafers or other human error; and 

defects in substrates and packaging. 

We constantly seek to improve our manufacturing
yields. Typically, for a given level of sales, when our yields improve, our gross margins improve, and when our yields decrease, our
unit costs are higher, our margins are lower, and our operating results are adversely affected. 

Costs of product defects and deviations from
required specifications could include the following: 

writing off inventory; 

scrapping products that cannot be fixed; 

accepting returns of products that have been shipped; 

providing product replacements at no charge; 

reimbursement of direct and indirect costs incurred by our customers
 in recalling or reworking their products due to defects in our products; 

travel and personnel costs to investigate potential product quality
 issues and to identify or confirm the failure mechanism or root cause of product defects; and 

defending against litigation. 

These costs could be significant and could reduce
our gross margins. Our reputation with customers also could be damaged as a result of product defects and quality issues, and product
demand could be reduced, which could harm our business and financial results. 

21 

Problems in scaling our manufacturing operations
could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Future customer demand may require us to significantly
increase our manufacturing capacity. There are substantial technical challenges to increasing manufacturing capacity, including equipment
acquisition lead times, materials procurement, scaling our manufacturing process, manufacturing site expansion, and the need to significantly
increase production yields while maintaining or improving quality control and assurance. Developing commercial-scale manufacturing facilities
will require the investment of substantial additional funds and the hiring and retention of additional management, quality assurance,
quality control and technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience. The scaling of manufacturing capacity is subject
to numerous risks and uncertainties and may lead to variability in product quality or reliability, prolonged construction timelines,
as well as resources required to acquire, install and maintain manufacturing equipment, among others, all of which can lead to unexpected
delays in manufacturing output. Additionally, the production of our products must occur in a highly controlled and clean environment
to minimize particles and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants. Weaknesses in process control or minute impurities in materials
may cause a substantial percentage of defective products. We may not be able to maintain stringent quality controls and contamination
problems could arise. Material defects in our products could result in loss or delay of revenues, delayed market acceptance, damage to
our reputation, lost customers, legal claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs. If we are unable to
successfully scale up our manufacturing operations to meet customer demand, our business growth could be materially adversely affected. 

Industry overcapacity could cause us to
underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 

It is difficult to predict future demand for
our products, which makes it difficult to estimate future requirements for production capacity and avoid periods of overcapacity. Fluctuations
in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products also can lead to overcapacity and contribute
to cyclicality in the semiconductor market. 

Capacity expansion projects have long lead times
and require capital commitments based on forecasted product trends and demand well in advance of production orders from customers. In
recent years, we have made significant capital investments to expand our RF filter capacity to address forecasted future demand patterns.
In certain cases, these capacity additions may exceed the near-term demand requirements, leading to overcapacity situations and underutilization
of our manufacturing facilities. 

As many of our manufacturing costs are fixed,
these costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues experienced during periods of underutilization. Underutilization
of our manufacturing facilities can adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results. If demand for our products experiences
a prolonged decrease, we may be required to close or idle facilities and write down our long-lived assets or shorten the useful lives
of underutilized assets and accelerate depreciation, which would increase our expenses. 

We face intense competition, which may
cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of potential market share and may materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

We compete with U.S. and international semiconductor
manufacturers and mobile semiconductor companies of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, some of whom have significantly
greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. We expect competition in our markets to intensify as
new competitors enter the market, existing competitors merge or form alliances, and new technologies emerge. Our competitors may introduce
new solutions and technologies that are superior to our products, are verified on a commercial scale, and have achieved widespread market
acceptance. Certain of our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can. This implementation
may require us to modify the manufacturing process for our filters, design new products to more stringent standards, and redesign some
existing products, which may prove difficult for us and result in delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. 

Increased competition could also result
in pricing pressures, declining average selling prices for our products, decreased gross margins and loss of potential market share.
We will need to make substantial investments to develop these enhancements and technologies, and we cannot assure investors that we will
have funds available for these investments or that these enhancements and technologies will be successful. If a competing technology
emerges that is, or is perceived to be, superior to our existing technology and we are unable to adapt to these changes and to compete
effectively, our market share and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our business, revenue, and results
of operations could be harmed. 

In addition, from time to time, governments may
provide subsidies or make other investments that could give competitive advantages to many semiconductor companies. In August 2022, the
United States enacted the CHIPS Act, which, among other things, provides funding to increase domestic production and research and development
in the semiconductor industry. Our competitors could receive government funding allocated under the CHIPS Act or otherwise benefit from
such investments to a greater extent than we do, which could cause them to gain market share and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

22 

We contract with a number of large service
providers and product companies that have considerable bargaining power, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that could
have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues. 

Large service providers and product companies
comprise a significant portion of our current and target customer bases. These customers generally have greater purchasing and bargaining
power than smaller entities and, accordingly, often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers, including us. As we seek
to expand our sales to existing customers and acquire new customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that are favorable
to our customers and that may affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs and have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, large customers have increased buying power and ability to
require onerous terms in our contracts with them, including pricing, warranties, and terms related to indemnification, intellectual property
ownership and licensing. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of these contracts, it could result in liabilities of a material nature,
including litigation, damages, additional costs, loss of market share, loss of intellectual property rights or exclusive use of such
rights, and loss of reputation. Additionally, the terms these large customers may require, such as most-favored customer or exclusivity provisions
with respect to specific products, may impact our ability to do business with other customers and generate revenues from such
customers. 

We may be subject to risks related to doing
business in, and having counterparties based in, foreign countries. 

We engage in operations, and enter into agreements
with counterparties, located outside the U.S., which exposes us to political, governmental and economic instability and foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations. 

Any disruption caused by these factors could
harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects. Risks associated with potential operations, commitments
and investments outside of the U.S. include but are not limited to risks of: 

global and local economic, social and political conditions and uncertainty, including heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, China and Taiwan, or other countries; 

currency exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations; 

war, including the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, or terrorist attack; 

local outbreak of disease, such as COVID-19; 

renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts or international
 trade arrangements; 

labor market conditions and workers rights affecting our manufacturing
 operations or those of our customers; 

macro-economic conditions impacting key markets and sources of supply; 

changing laws and policies affecting trade, taxation, financial regulation,
 immigration, and investment; 

compliance with laws and regulations that differ among jurisdictions,
 including those covering taxes, intellectual property ownership and infringement, imports and exports, anti-corruption and anti-bribery,
 antitrust and competition, data privacy, and environment, health, and safety; and 

general hazards associated with the assertion of sovereignty over areas
 in which operations are conducted, transactions occur, or counterparties are located. 

As our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar,
any operations conducted outside the U.S. or transactions denominated in foreign currencies would face additional risks of fluctuating
currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. In addition, we would be subject to the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations and exchange rate changes on our financial reports when translating our assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses from operations or transactions outside of the U.S. into U.S. dollars at the then-applicable exchange rates. These
translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. 

RFMi relies on third parties outside the
U.S., including in Taiwan, for its development and manufacturing activities . 

Our subsidiary, RFMi, depends on contractors for
certain of its manufacturing and research and development activities. Specifically, RFMi s contract manufacturer, TST, produces
the majority of products sold by RFMi. TST ships some products to RFMi for distribution to end customers and, in some cases, ships products
directly to those customers. TST is located in Taiwan and therefore geopolitical changes in China-Taiwan relations could disrupt its operations,
which would adversely affect RFMi s ability to manufacture certain products. In addition, we have leased office space and have operations
in Taiwan. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be affected by changes in governmental and economic
policies in Taiwan, social instability and diplomatic and social developments in or affecting Taiwan due to its unique international political
status. We cannot assure that relations between Taiwan and China will not face political, military or economic uncertainties in the future.
Any deterioration in the relations between Taiwan and China, and other factors affecting military, political or economic conditions in
Taiwan, could disrupt RFMi s and our business operations and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 

23 

Economic regulation in China could adversely
impact our business and results of operations. 

A significant portion of our potential customer
base is in China. For many years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid growth and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation.
In response to these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulate growth and to contain inflation,
including currency controls and measures designed to restrict credit, control prices or set currency exchange rates. Such actions in
the future, as well as other changes in Chinese laws and regulations, including actions in furtherance of China s stated policy
of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers as well as China s data localization policies and measures, could
increase the cost of doing business in China, foster the emergence of Chinese-based competitors, decrease the demand for our products
in China, or reduce the supply of critical materials for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations. 

Changes in government trade and investment
policies, including the imposition of tariffs, export restrictions, sanctions, transaction restrictions, or retaliatory measures could
limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations. 

The
U.S. or foreign governments may take administrative, legislative or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability
to sell products in certain countries, particularly Russia and in China. For example, beginning in May 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs,
ranging from 7.5 to 25 on approximately two-thirds of U.S. imports from China, including certain electronic components and equipment.
China has taken retaliatory actions, including imposing tariffs on certain U.S. exports effective September, 2019. While the imposition
of these tariffs did not have a direct, material adverse impact on our business during fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the direct and
indirect effects of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure and are only one part of a larger U.S./China
economic and trade policy friction. For example, U.S. government actions targeting
exports of certain technologies to and from China are becoming more pervasive. In 2018, the U.S. adopted new laws designed to address
concerns about the export of emerging and foundational technologies to China. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued regulations
implementing former President Trump s executive order invoking national emergency economic powers to implement a framework to regulate
the acquisition or transfer of information communications technology in transactions that imposed undue national security risks. In addition,
the U.S. Department of Commerce enacted new rules that expanded export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to
companies and other end-users in China that are designated as military end-users or have operations that could support military end uses;
has added additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list and unverified list under suspicion of military-civil fusion, support
of Russia, or other factors associated with a broadening scope of national security concerns; and has expanded an existing rule (referred
to as the foreign direct product rule) in a manner that could cause foreign-made wafers, chipsets, and certain related items to be subject
to U.S. licensing requirements if certain Chinese corporations or their affiliates are parties to a transaction involving the items. 

In response to these and other U.S. actions, China
could determine to take or appear to have taken countermeasures against U.S. companies doing business in or with China. These series
of actions and other types of countermeasures could lead to additional restrictions on the export of products that include or enable certain
technologies, including products we could potentially provide to China-based customers. More recently in August 2023, President Biden
issued an executive order that provides for the establishment of a new outbound investment program to block and regulate investment in
China in sensitive technologies. In addition, the Biden administration has and likely will continue to take action under U.S. export control
laws to restrict transfer of goods, technology, information, and the provision of services that could harm U.S. national security. 

Furthermore, the imposition of tariffs on our
potential customers products that are imported from China to the U.S. could harm sales of such products, which could indirectly
harm our business. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs, export controls, countermeasures,
or other trade measures between the U.S. and China or other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions
may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. 

The loss or temporary loss of potential foreign
customers or the imposition of restrictions on our ability to sell products to such customers as a result of tariffs, export restrictions,
sanctions or other U.S. executive or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our sales, business and results of operations. 

24 

We depend on a few large customers for
a substantial portion of our revenue. 

A substantial portion of our revenue comes from
large purchases by a small number of customers. Our future operating results depend on both the success of our largest customers and
on our success in diversifying our products and customer base. 

The concentration of our revenue with a relatively
small number of customers makes us particularly dependent on factors, both positive and negative, affecting those customers. If demand
for their devices incorporating our products increases, our results are favorably impacted, while if demand for their devices decreases,
they may reduce their purchases of, or stop purchasing, our products and our operating results would suffer. Even if we achieve a design
win, our customers can delay, temporarily suspend, or cancel the manufacture or release of a new device for any reason, such as a shortage
of supply of other components needed to manufacture their device. Most of our customers can cease incorporating our products into their
devices with little notice to us and with little or no penalty. The loss of a large customer and failure to add new customers to replace
lost revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Global shortages in manufacturing capacities
could negatively affect our operations and negatively impact our results of operations. 

Our business depends in significant part upon manufacturers of products
requiring semiconductors, as well as the current and anticipated production of these products. As a supplier to such manufacturers, we
are subject to the business cycles that characterize the industry. Past increases in demand for semiconductor products have resulted in
a global shortage of manufacturing capacities. If this shortage occurs again, and our customers are forced to reduce the amount of their
products they manufacture or plan to manufacture due to a limited supply of semiconductors, our business, financial condition and results
of operations could be negatively affected. 

Changes in general economic conditions,
together with other factors, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry, and our business, therefore, may also experience
cyclical fluctuations in the future. 

From time to time, changes in general economic
conditions, together with other factors, may cause significant upturns and downturns in the semiconductor industry. These fluctuations
are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 

levels of inventory in our end markets, 

availability and cost of supply for manufacturing of our products, 

changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured with our technology
 and sold by our prospective customers, 

exposure to foreign currency exchange rates, import duties and tariffs, 

inflation or a tightening of the credit markets 

industry production capacity levels and fluctuations in industry manufacturing
 yields, 

market acceptance of our current and future customers products
 that incorporate our RF filters, 

the gain or loss of significant customers, 

the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in
 average selling prices of products, 

new product and technology introductions by competitors, 

changes in the mix of products produced and sold, and 

intellectual property disputes. 

25 

As a result, the demand for our products can
change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate, and our business, therefore, may also experience cyclical fluctuations in future operating
results. In addition, future downturns in the electronic systems industry could adversely impact our revenue and harm our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast
revenue, gross margin and expenses, and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt. For example, an escalation of trade tensions
between the U.S. and China has resulted in trade restrictions and increased tariffs that harm our ability to participate in Chinese markets
or compete effectively with Chinese companies. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions and further
escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, especially China, and possible decoupling of the U.S. and China
economies, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade. 

We have had recent departures of key executive
officers and major changes in our Board of Directors. These changes may create uncertainty and, more generally, if we are unable to attract
and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively
operate our business. 

As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key
technical personnel represent a significant asset. We believe that our future success is highly dependent on the continued services of
our current key officers, employees, and Board members, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced technical
personnel. The loss of key personnel could have a detrimental effect on our operations. Specifically, the recent departures of our President
and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President of Business Development, and major changes in our Board and other senior
management may create uncertainty within the remaining personnel. Turnover of this kind may result in remaining employees taking on increased
responsibilities, which could divert attention from key business areas. An inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel
could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. The competition for management and technical personnel is
intense in the wireless semiconductor industry, and therefore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified
management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. 

If we are unable to establish effective
marketing and sales capabilities or enter into additional agreements with third parties to market and sell our products, we may not be
able to effectively generate and sustain or increase product revenues. 

We have limited experience selling, marketing
or distributing products and currently have a small internal marketing and sales force. To progress the launch and commercialization
of our technology and our products, we must build on a territory-by-territory basis marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other
non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so.
Therefore, we may choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties that have direct sales
forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales
force and distribution systems. If so, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships
for such capabilities, such collaborator s strategic interest in the products under development and such collaborator s ability
to successfully market and sell any such products. 

If we are unable to enter into such arrangements
when needed on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. Further, to the extent that
we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties,
and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. If we decide in the future to establish an internal sales and marketing
team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our products, it could be expensive and time
consuming and would require significant attention of our executive officers to manage. We may also not have sufficient resources to allocate
to the sales and marketing of our products. Any failure or delay in the development of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities,
either through collaboration with one or more third parties or through internal efforts, would adversely impact the commercialization
of any of our products that we obtain approval to market. As a result, our future product revenue would suffer, and we may incur significant
additional losses. 

26 

We may engage in future acquisitions that
could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our shareholders and harm our financial condition and operating results. 

We have in the past acquired other businesses and may, in the future,
make acquisitions of, or investments in, companies that we believe have products or capabilities that are a strategic or commercial fit
with our current business or otherwise offer opportunities for our company. In connection with these acquisitions or investments, we may: 

issue Common Stock or other forms of equity that would dilute our existing
 shareholders percentage of ownership, 

incur debt and assume liabilities, and 

incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets or incur large
 and immediate write-offs. 

We may not be able to complete acquisitions on
favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete an acquisition, we cannot assure you that it will ultimately strengthen our competitive
position or that it will be viewed positively by customers, financial markets or investors. Furthermore, future acquisitions could pose
numerous additional risks to our expected operations, including: 

problems integrating the purchased business, products or technologies, 

challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other
 anticipated benefits, 

increases to our expenses, 

the assumption of significant liabilities that exceed the limitations
 of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying party, 

inability to maintain relationships with prospective key customers,
 vendors and other business partners of the acquired businesses, 

diversion of management s attention from its day-to-day responsibilities, 

difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during
 the transition and integration, 

entrance into marketplaces where we have no or limited prior experience
 and where competitors have stronger marketplace positions, 

potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired
 entity, and 

historical financial information may not be representative or indicative
 of our results as a combined company. 

Unsolicited takeover proposals, governance
change proposals, proxy contests and certain proposals/actions by activist investors may create additional risks and uncertainties with
respect to our financial position, operations, strategies and management, and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain
key employees. Any perceived uncertainties may affect the market price and volatility of our securities. 

Public companies in the technology industry have
been the target of unsolicited takeover proposals in the past. In the event that a third party, such as a competitor, private equity
firm or activist investor makes an unsolicited takeover proposal, or proposes to change our governance policies or board of directors,
or makes other proposals concerning our ownership structure or operations, our review and consideration of such proposals may be a significant
distraction for our management and employees, and may require us to expend significant time and resources. Such proposals may create
uncertainty for our employees, additional risks and uncertainties with respect to our financial position, operations, strategies and
management, and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction
also may affect the market price and volatility of our securities.

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 

If we fail to obtain, maintain and enforce
our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies. 

Our long-term success largely depends on our
ability to market technologically competitive products which, in turn, largely depends on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate
intellectual property protection and to enforce our proprietary rights without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. While
we rely upon a combination of our patent applications currently pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ),
our trademarks, copyrights, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our
technologies, there can be no assurance that: 

our currently pending or future patent applications will result in
 issued patents, 

our limited patent portfolio will provide adequate protection to our
 core technology, 

we will succeed in protecting our technology adequately in all key
 jurisdictions, 

we will be able to finalize negotiations to enter into agreements pursuant
 to which we will license certain patents, or 

we can prevent third parties from disclosure or misappropriation of
 our proprietary information which could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding
 any competitive advantage we may derive from the proprietary information. 

In addition, we intend to expand our international
presence, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. 

We have a limited number of patent applications,
which may not result in issued patents or patents that fully protect our intellectual property. 

In the United States and internationally we had
97 applications as of August 25, 2023; however, there is no assurance that any of the pending applications or our future patent applications
will result in patents being issued, or that any patents that may be issued as a result of existing or future applications will provide
meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. 

The process of seeking patent protection in the
United States and abroad can be long and expensive. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential
for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain at the time of filing that we are the first to file any patent application related
to our technology. In addition, patent applications are often published as part of the patent application process, even if such applications
do not issue as patents. When published, such applications will become publicly available, and proprietary information disclosed in the
application will become available to others. While at present we are unaware of competing patent applications, competing applications
could potentially surface. 

Even if all of our pending patent applications
are granted and result in registration of our patents, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced, or that
the scope of any patent rights could provide a sufficient degree of protection that could permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage
with respect to these products and technologies. For example, we cannot predict: 

the degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against
 competitors, including whether third parties will find ways to make, use, sell, offer to sell or import competitive products without
 infringing our patents; 

if and when patents will be issued; 

if third parties will obtain patents claiming inventions similar to
 those covered by our patents and patent applications; 

28 

if third parties have blocking patents that could be used to prevent
 us from marketing our own patented products and practicing our own technology; or 

whether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings
 (e.g., at the USPTO) in connection with patent rights, which may be costly whether we win or lose. 

As a result, the patent applications we own may
fail to result in issued patents in the United States. Third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any issued
patents or patents issued to us in the future, which may result in those patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Even
if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others
from developing similar products that do not infringe the claims made in our patents. If the breadth or strength of protection provided
by the patents we hold or pursue is threatened, we may not be able to prevent others from offering similar technology and products in
the RFFE mobile market and our ability to commercialize our RF filters with technology protected by those patents could be threatened. 

If we fail to obtain issued patents outside of
the United States, our ability to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property
rights in countries outside of the United States where our filters may be sold in the future may be significantly limited. If we file
foreign patent applications related to our pending U.S. patent applications or to our issued patents in the United States, these applications
may be contested and fail to result in issued patents outside of the United States or we may be required to narrow our claims. Even if
some or all of our patent applications are granted outside of the United States and result in issued patents, effective enforcement of
rights granted by these patents in some countries may not be available due to the differences in foreign patent and other laws concerning
intellectual property rights, a relatively weak legal regime protecting intellectual property rights in these countries, and because
it is difficult, expensive and time-consuming to police unauthorized use of our intellectual property when infringers are overseas. This
failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights outside of the United States could have a materially
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. 

We are, and may in the future be, involved
in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. 

Competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our potential
licensors. To attempt to stop infringement or unauthorized use, we may file infringement claims from time to time, which can be expensive
and time consuming and distract management. The Company s lawsuit, Akoustis Technologies, Inc. vs. Qorvo, Inc., TX Case 2:23-cv-00180-JRG-RSP ,
is an example of the Company s effort to prevent infringement of its patents. For more information, see Litigation, Claims
and Assessments in Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies of the consolidated financial statements in Item
8 of Part II of this Annual Report. 

If we pursue any infringement proceeding, a court
may decide that a patent of ours or one of our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from
using the relevant technology on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. Additionally, any enforcement
of our patents may provoke third parties to assert counterclaims against us. Some of our current and potential competitors have the ability
to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights than we have. Moreover, the legal systems
of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, which could reduce the likelihood
of success of, or the amount of damages that could be awarded resulting from, any infringement proceeding we pursue in any such jurisdiction.
An adverse result in any infringement litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated,
held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, which could limit the ability
of our filters to compete in those jurisdictions. 

Interference proceedings could be provoked by third parties or brought
by the USPTO to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could
require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to use it from the prevailing party. Our business could
be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 

29 

We need to protect our trademark rights
and disclosure of our trade secrets to prevent competitors from taking advantage of our goodwill. 

We believe that the protection of our trademark
rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand, maintaining goodwill, and maintaining or increasing market
share. We currently have nineteen registered domestic and international trademarks and two pending domestic trademark applications including
the marks AKOUSTIS, XBAW, and RFMi in multiple forms and international classes. We may expend substantial cost and effort in an attempt
to register new trademarks and maintain and enforce our trademark rights. If we do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks
from infringement, any goodwill that we have developed in those trademarks could be lost or impaired. 

Third parties may claim that the sale or promotion
of our products, when and if we have any, may infringe on the trademark rights of others. Trademark infringement problems occur frequently
in connection with the sale and marketing of products in the RFFE mobile industry. If we become involved in any dispute regarding our
trademark rights, regardless of whether we prevail, we could be required to engage in costly, distracting and time-consuming litigation
that could harm our business. If the trademarks we use are found to infringe upon the trademark of another company, we could be liable
for damages and be forced to stop using those trademarks, and as result, we could lose all the goodwill that has been developed in those
trademarks. 

In addition to the protection afforded by patents
and trademarks, we seek to rely on copyright, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how
that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our processes that involve proprietary
know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. For Akoustis, this includes chip layouts, circuit designs, resonator
layouts and implementation, and MEMS resonator device engineering. Although we require all of our employees and certain consultants and
advisors to assign inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary
know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, our trade secrets and other proprietary information may
be disclosed, or competitors may otherwise gain access to such information or independently develop substantially equivalent information.
If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not
be able to establish or maintain the competitive advantage that we believe is provided by such intellectual property, which would weaken
our competitive market position, and materially adversely affect our business and operational results. 

Development of certain technologies with
our manufacturers and other suppliers may result in restrictions on jointly-developed intellectual property. 

In order to maintain and expand our strategic
relationship with manufacturers of our filters and other suppliers, we may, from time to time, develop certain technologies jointly with
these manufacturers and other suppliers and file for further intellectual property protection and/or seek to commercialize such technologies.
We may enter into joint development agreements with manufacturers and other suppliers to provide for joint development works and joint
intellectual property rights by us and by such manufacturer or supplier. Such agreements may restrict our commercial use of such intellectual
property, or may require written consent from, or a separate agreement with, that manufacturer or supplier. In other cases, we may not
have any rights to use intellectual property solely developed and owned by such manufacturer, supplier, or another third party. If we
cannot obtain commercial use rights for such jointly-owned intellectual property or intellectual property solely owned by these manufacturers
or suppliers, our future product development and commercialization plans may be adversely affected. 

30 

We have been subject to claims of infringement,
misappropriation or misuse of third party intellectual property that have resulted in significant expense and severe disruption to our
business, and we may become subject to similar claims in the future. 

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
the vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights. We have not undertaken a comprehensive review of the rights of third
parties in our field. From time to time, we may be named in lawsuits or receive notices or inquiries from third parties regarding
our products or the manner in which we conduct our business suggesting that we may be infringing, misappropriating or otherwise misusing
patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights. Any claims that our technology infringes, misappropriates
or otherwise misuses the rights of third parties, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be expensive to litigate or settle and
could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, cause significant delays and materially disrupt the
conduct of our business. We may not prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual
property litigation. If such proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to: 

pay substantial damages, including treble damages if we were held to
 have willfully infringed; 

cease the manufacture, offering for sale or sale of the infringing
 technology or processes; 

expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or
 processes; 

obtain a license from a third party, which may not be available on
 commercially reasonable terms, or may not be available at all; or 

lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect
 royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others. 

As described under Litigation, Claims and
Assessments in Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies of the consolidated financial statements in Item
8 of Part II of this Annual Report, the Qorvo Litigation has resulted in a verdict against the Company awarding Qorvo a substantial amount
of damages and the District Court has subsequently awarded Qorvo attorneys fees and pre- and post-judgment interest, which has
several constrained our liquidity and may cause us to file for protection under the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, as described under
Note 15, the Company has filed a complaint against Qorvo in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement
by Qorvo of certain Company patents. 

The litigation described above has been prolonged
and costly and resulted in significant expenses, diversion of management and technical personnel attention and disruptions and delays
in the Company s business and product development, and other collateral consequences, all of which could have a material adverse
effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any out-of-court settlement of the above matters or other actions
may also have an adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited
to, substantial expenses, the payment of royalties, licensing or other fees payable to third parties, or restrictions on its ability to
develop, manufacture, and sell its products. 

From time to time, the Company may become
involved in other lawsuits, investigations, and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has
meritorious defenses against such other pending claims and intends to vigorously pursue them. While it is not possible to predict or
determine the outcomes of any such other pending actions, the Company believes the amount of liability, if any, with respect to such
other pending actions, would not materially affect its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

In addition, our agreements with prospective
customers and manufacturing partners may require us to indemnify such customers and manufacturing partners for third party intellectual
property infringement claims. Pursuant to such agreements, we may be required to defend such customers and manufacturing partners against
certain claims that could cause us to incur additional costs. While we endeavor to include as part of such indemnification obligations
a provision permitting us to assume the defense of any indemnification claim, not all of our current agreements contain such a provision
and we cannot provide any assurance that our future agreements will contain such a provision, which could result in increased exposure
to us in the case of an indemnification claim. 

31 

Risks Related to Regulatory Requirements 

Government regulation may adversely affect
our business. 

The effects of regulation may materially and adversely
impact our business. For example, regulatory policies of the FCC relating to radio frequency emissions, consumer protection laws of the
FTC, product safety regulatory activities of the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the import/export regulatory activities of the Department
of Commerce, international traffic in arms regulations (ITAR) administered by the Department of State, and environmental regulatory activities
of the EPA could impede sales of our products in the United States. We and our customers are also subject to various import and export
laws and regulations. If we fail to continue to comply with these regulations, we may be unable to manufacture the affected products or
ship these products to certain customers and be subject to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions,
disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. Additionally, these rules and regulations may in
the future be expanded such that they may have a greater effect on our business than they do currently. 

As described above under the risk factor entitled
 We may be subject to risks related to doing business in, and having counterparties based in, foreign countries, our business
is also increasingly subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to, anti-corruption laws, such
as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and equivalent laws in other jurisdictions, antitrust or competition laws, and data privacy laws,
among others. Foreign governments may also impose tariffs, duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non-domestic
suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally. These tariffs, duties or restrictions could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our product or manufacturing standards could
also be impacted by new or revised environmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives. Those rules, or similar rules that
may be adopted in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect our costs, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships
with customers and suppliers. 

We may incur substantial expenses in connection
with regulatory requirements, and any regulatory compliance failure could cause our business to suffer. 

The wireless communications industry is subject
to ongoing regulatory obligations and review. See Business - Government Regulations above. Maintaining compliance with
these requirements may result in significant additional expense to us, and any failure to maintain such compliance could cause our business
to suffer. 

Noncompliance with applicable regulations or
requirements could also subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits,
fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could require us to pay contractual
damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys fees and costs. These enforcement actions could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil
or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition,
responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management s attention and resources and an increase
in professional fees. 

Compliance with regulations regarding the
use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products. 

Regulations in the United States require that
we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo or adjoining countries, or originated from recycled or scrap sources. We incur costs associated with our policies and procedures
to comply with the applicable rules and due diligence procedures. In addition, verification and reporting requirements could affect the
sourcing and availability of minerals that are used in the manufacture of our products, and we may face reputational and competitive
challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all conflict minerals used in our products. We may also face challenges
with government regulators, potential customers, suppliers and manufacturers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals
used in our products are conflict free. 

32 

There could be an adverse change or increase
in the laws and/or regulations governing our business. 

We and our operating subsidiaries are subject to various laws and regulations
in different jurisdictions, and the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations are subject to change. We are also subject
to different tax regulations in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct our business or where our management or the management of our
operating subsidiary is located. We expect that the scope and extent of regulation in these jurisdictions, as well as regulatory oversight
and supervision, will generally continue to increase. There can be no assurance that future regulatory, judicial and legislative changes
in any jurisdiction will not have a material adverse effect on us or hinder us in the operation of our business. In addition, we may incur
substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to us. 

These current or future laws and regulations
may impair our research, development or production efforts or impact the research activities we pursue. Our failure to comply with these
laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions, which could cause our financial condition to
suffer. 

Investment Risks 

You could lose all of your investment. 

An investment in our securities is speculative
and involves a high degree of risk. Potential investors should be aware that the value of an investment in the Company may go down as
well as up. In addition, there can be no certainty that the market value of an investment in the Company will fully reflect its underlying
value. 

Our failure to meet the minimum bid price
or other requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, including the minimum stockholders equity requirement, could
adversely affect our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our Common Stock, and could result in
the delisting of our Common Stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

On October 24, 2023, we received notification
from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, stating that the Company did not comply with the minimum
 1.00 bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Requirement ).
In accordance with Nasdaq listing rules, the Company was afforded 180 calendar days (until April 22, 2024) to regain compliance with the
Bid Price Requirement (the Initial Compliance Period ). To regain compliance, the closing bid price of Common Stock needed
to meet or exceed 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period, all as described in more
detail in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 2023. Since the
Company did not regain compliance by April 22, 2024, the Company requested, and was granted, an additional 180 calendar days to regain
compliance with Bid Price Requirement expiring October 21, 2024. 

On August 19, 2024, the Company received notice
from the Staff indicating that the bid price for the Common Stock had closed at 0.10 or less per share for the 10-consecutive trading
day period ended August 16, 2024 and, accordingly, the Company is subject to the provisions contemplated under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii).
As a result, the Staff determined to delist the Common Stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market (the Delisting Determination ).
The Company has requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel to appeal the Delisting Determination. The
hearing request automatically stays any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any compliance period
granted by the Panel following the hearing. The Company s hearing has been scheduled for October 8, 2024. 

Notwithstanding the Company s request for
a hearing, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company any compliance period or that the Company will ultimately regain
compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Additionally, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires
listed companies to maintain minimum stockholders equity of 2.5 million. As of June 30, 2024, as reflected in the consolidated
balance sheet included in this Report, we had a negative stockholders equity and therefore may receive an additional delisting
notice from the Staff in respect of this deficiency. 

The delisting of our Common Stock from the Nasdaq
Capital Market would constitute an event of default under our 44.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, enabling
the noteholders to accelerate the convertible notes such that the outstanding amounts are due and payable immediately. Furthermore, our
delisting would materially impair our ability to raise capital and the market liquidity of our Common Stock could be adversely affected
and its market price could decrease. If our Common Stock trades on the over-the-counter market, selling our Common Stock could be more
difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and we could face significant
material adverse consequences, including: a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; reduced liquidity with respect
to our securities; a determination that our shares are a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our securities
to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;
a reduced amount of news and analyst coverage; and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in
the future. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our Common Stock and would substantially
impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities
for us. 

33 

Stockholders may experience dilution of
their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock or preferred stock or other securities
that are convertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock or preferred stock. 

In the future, we may issue our authorized but
previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders. The Company is authorized
to issue an aggregate of 175,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. We may issue additional shares of
our Common Stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock in connection with hiring or
retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes.
In addition, as of October 02, 2024, options to purchase 1,995,754 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding. The future issuance of
additional shares of our Common Stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the Common Stock. We may need to raise additional
capital in the future to meet our working capital needs, and there can be no assurance that we will not issue additional shares, warrants
or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with these capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices)
below the price you paid for your stock. 

We do not anticipate paying dividends on
our Common Stock. 

Cash dividends have never been declared or paid
on our Common Stock, and we do not anticipate such a declaration or payment for the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings,
if any, to fund business growth. Therefore, stockholders will not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares of Common Stock. If
we do not pay dividends, our Common Stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price
appreciates. We cannot assure stockholders that our stock price will appreciate or that they will receive a positive return on their
investment if and when they sell their shares. 

General Risk Factors 

Security breaches and other disruptions
could compromise our proprietary information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. 

We rely on trade secrets, technical know-how
and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities to provide us with competitive
advantages. We protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, strategic partners
and other third parties. We also design our computer networks and implement various procedures to restrict unauthorized access to dissemination
of our proprietary information. 

We face internal and external data security threats. Current, departing
or former employees or third parties that improperly use or access our computer systems and networks could copy, obtain or misappropriate
our proprietary information or otherwise interrupt our business. Like other businesses, we are also subject to significant system or network
disruptions from numerous causes, including computer viruses and other cyber-attacks, facility access issues, new system implementations
and energy blackouts. 

Security breaches, computer malware, phishing,
spoofing, and other cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. Geopolitical instability, such as Russia s
invasion of Ukraine, may increase the likelihood that we will experience direct or collateral consequences from cyber conflicts between
nation-states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure. While we defend against these threats
on a daily basis, we do not believe that such attacks to date have caused us any material damage. Because the techniques used by computer
hackers and others to access or sabotage networks constantly evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target,
we may be unable to anticipate, counter or ameliorate all of these techniques. As a result, our and our customers proprietary
information may be misappropriated, and the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Any loss of such information could harm
our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and
procedures, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the incident, and divert management and other resources.
We routinely implement improvements to our network security safeguards and we are devoting increasing resources to the security of our
information technology systems. We cannot, however, assure that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage
from any future cyber-attack or network disruption. 

The costs related to cyber-attacks or other security
threats or computer systems disruptions typically would not be fully insured or indemnified by others. Occurrence of any of the events
described above could result in loss of competitive advantages derived from our R D efforts or our intellectual property. Moreover,
these events may result in the early obsolescence of our products, product development delays, or diversion of the attention of management
and key information technology and other resources, or otherwise adversely affect our internal operations and reputation or degrade our
financial results and stock price. 

34 

We may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse
of personal data by or about our employees, customers or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation,
or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. 

In the ordinary course of our business, we have
access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information regarding our employees and others that is subject to privacy and security
laws and regulations. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business,
or by our third-party service providers, including business process software applications providers and other vendors that have access
to sensitive data, could result in damage to our reputation, disruption of our business activities, significantly increased business
and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. 

Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and
policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. For example, the European
Union has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ), which requires companies to comply with rules regarding
the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such
data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to the higher of 20 million or 4 of worldwide
revenue. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often
uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. Complying with these
changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business
and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop
the alleged non-compliant activity. Finally, even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related
or data protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries or proceedings against us by governmental entities
or others. 

Our business and operations would suffer
in the event of system failures, and our operations are vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters, terrorist activity, power loss
and other events beyond our control, the occurrence of which could materially harm our business. 

Despite the implementation of security measures,
our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized
access as well as telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security
breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of
our R D. If any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure
of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and/or the further development of our technology for RF filters
could be delayed. 

We are also vulnerable to accidents, electrical
blackouts, fires, labor strikes, terrorist activities, war, natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and tornadoes,
and other events beyond our control, and we have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business as
a result of any such events and do not have an applicable recovery plan in place. We carry business interruption insurance that would
compensate us for certain actual losses from interruptions of our business that may occur, however that may not fully cover all losses
incurred, any losses or damages incurred could cause our business to materially suffer. 

Product liability claims, could expose us
to significant liabilities, occupy a significant amount of our management s time and attention and damage our reputation. 

We are from time to time party to various litigation
claims and legal proceedings, which may include product liability claims. We evaluate these claims and proceedings to assess the likelihood
of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. If we or any of our manufacturers fails to successfully
manufacture wafers that conform to our design specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FCC, it may result in substantial
risk of undetected flaws in components or other materials used by our manufacturers during fabrication of our products and could lead
to product defects and costs to repair or replace these parts or materials, significantly impacting our ability to develop and implement
our technology and to improve performance of our products. In addition, claims made or threatened by our suppliers, customers or current
or former employees could adversely affect our relationships, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. The costs associated with defending product liability and other claims, and the payment of damages,
could be substantial. Our reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful. 

35 

We may establish reserves (such as those reflected in the financial
statements included with this Report in respect of the Qorvo Litigation) as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance
with our accounting policies in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We base our assessments, estimates and disclosures on the information available
to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates.
Actual settlements, judgments or resolutions of these claims or proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance.
A successful claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make
significant payments of damages and could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Delaware law, our charter documents and
the ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional stock could impede or discourage a takeover or change of control that
stockholders may consider favorable. 

As a Delaware corporation, we are subject to
certain anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 percent
or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has
approved the transaction. Accordingly, our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of our company.
In addition, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change
of control or changes in our management. These provisions include only our Board of Directors being able to fill vacancies on the Board
and various limitations in our bylaws on stockholder meeting, including advance notice requirements for stockholders to make nominations
of candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders and our stockholders not having
the ability to call a special meeting. 

Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue
up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with powers, rights and preferences designated by it. Shares of voting or convertible preferred
stock could be issued, or rights to purchase such shares could be issued, to create voting impediments or to frustrate persons seeking
to effect a takeover or otherwise gain control of the Company. The ability of the Board to issue such additional shares of preferred
stock, with rights and preferences it deems advisable, could discourage an attempt by a party to acquire control of the Company by tender
offer or other means. Such issuances could therefore deprive stockholders of benefits that could result from such an attempt, such as
the realization of a premium over the market price for their shares in a tender offer or the temporary increase in market price that
such an attempt could cause. Moreover, the issuance of such additional shares of preferred stock to persons supporting of the Board of
Directors could make it more difficult to remove incumbent managers and directors from office even if such change were to be favorable
to stockholders generally. 

Our bylaws provide, subject to certain
exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation
matters, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,
officers, employees or stockholders. 

Our bylaws provide, subject to limited exceptions,
that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for
any claims, including any derivative actions or proceedings brought on our behalf, (1) that are based upon a violation of a duty by a
current or former director or officer or stockholder in such capacity or (2) that may be brought in the Court of Chancery pursuant to
the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our Common Stock
shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our bylaws described above. This choice of forum provision
may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our
directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court
were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur
additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

36 

As a smaller reporting company and
a non-accelerated filer, we are subject to scaled disclosure requirements that may make it more challenging for investors to analyze
our results of operations and financial prospects and may cause investors to find our Common Stock less attractive. 

As a smaller reporting company, we are subject
to scaled disclosure requirements that may make it more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial
prospects. For instance, as a smaller reporting company, which is generally defined as a company with less than 250 million
of public float or a company with less than 100 million in annual revenues and either no public float or a public float of less than
 700 million, we may elect to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings and take advantage of other decreased
disclosure obligations in our filings with the SEC, including being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements
in our annual reports. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.
Additionally, under current SEC rules, we are not an accelerated filer and so not required to include an auditor attestation
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We cannot predict if investors
will find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on these reduced requirements. If some investors find our Common Stock
less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and the price of shares of our Common
Stock may be more volatile. 

Being a public company is expensive and
administratively burdensome. 

As a public reporting company, we are subject
to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and
other federal securities laws, rules and regulations related thereto, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Complying with
these laws and regulations requires the time and attention of our Board of Directors and management and increases our expenses. Among
other things, we are required to: 

maintain and evaluate a system of internal control over financial reporting
 in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and
 the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; 

maintain policies relating to disclosure controls and procedures; 

prepare and distribute periodic reports in compliance with our obligations
 under federal securities laws; 

institute a more comprehensive compliance function, including with
 respect to corporate governance; and 

involve, to a greater degree, our outside legal counsel and accountants
 in the above activities. 

The costs of preparing and filing annual and
quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders is expensive and
much greater than that of a privately-held company, and compliance with these rules and regulations may require us to hire additional
financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel, and will involve a material increase in regulatory, legal and accounting
expenses and the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable regulations in
a timely manner, if at all. In addition, being a public company makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability
insurance. In the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain this coverage.
These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and members of our Board of Directors,
particularly directors willing to serve on the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 

Our current headquarters in Huntersville, NC is 22,400 square feet,
and its base rent is approximately 22,000 per month with a term expiring February 2026. In June 2017, the Company acquired a 120,000
square foot MEMS fabrication facility in Canandaigua, NY (the NY Facility ). The Company has entered into a Lease and Project
Agreement and a Company Lease Agreement with the Ontario County Industrial Development Agency, a public benefit corporation of the State
of New York (the OCIDA ), covering the NY Facility, pursuant to which the Company leases the NY Facility to the OCIDA for
nominal consideration and the OCIDA leases the NY Facility back to the Company for annual rent payments set forth in such agreements. 

As part of the acquisition of RFMi, the Company
assumed a lease in Carrollton, Texas. The lease covering this property is currently scheduled to expire in March 2025. 

As part of the acquisition of GDSI, the Company entered into a lease
in San Jose, California. The lease covering this property is currently scheduled to expire in December 2025. 

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022,
the Company entered into a new office lease located in Taiwan. The lease covering this property is currently scheduled to expire in May
2025. 

The Company believes that its existing facilities
will be suitable and sufficient to meet the Company s needs for the next several years. 

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may become involved in

The following management s discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. See also the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information on page ii of this Report. 

The following discussion highlights the results
of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition, as well as our liquidity and capital resources for
the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements
of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on the audited financial
statements contained in this Report, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto. 

Overview 

Akoustis Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
was incorporated in 2013. The Company is focused on developing, designing, and manufacturing innovative RF filter solutions for the wireless
industry, including for products such as smartphones and tablets, network infrastructure equipment, Wi-Fi Customer Premise Equipment CPE and defense applications. Filters are critical in selecting and rejecting signals, and their performance enables differentiation in the
modules defining the RF front-end RFFE ). Located between the device s antenna and its digital backend, the RFFE 
is the circuitry that performs the analog signal processing and contains components such as amplifiers, filters and switches. We have
developed a proprietary microelectromechanical system MEMS based bulk acoustic wave BAW technology and
a unique manufacturing process flow, called XBAW , for our filters produced for use in RFFE modules. Our XBAW TM filters
incorporate optimized high purity piezoelectric materials for high power, high frequency and wide bandwidth operation. We are developing
RF Filters for 5G, Wi-Fi and defense bands using our proprietary resonator device models and product design kits (PDKs). As we qualify
our RF filter products, we are engaging with target customers to evaluate our filter solutions. 

Our initial designs have targeted UHB, sub-7 GHz 5G, Wi-Fi and defense
bands. We expect our filter solutions will address problems (such as loss, bandwidth, power handling, and isolation) created by the growing
number of frequency bands in the RFFE of mobile devices, infrastructure and premise equipment to support 5G and Wi-Fi. We have prototyped,
sampled and begun commercial shipment of our single-band low loss BAW filter designs for 5G frequency bands and 5 GHz and 6 GHz Wi-Fi
bands, which are suited to competitive BAW solutions and historically cannot be addressed with low-band, lower power handling surface
acoustic wave SAW technology. Additionally, through our wholly owned subsidiary, RFMi, of which we acquired majority ownership
in October 2021 and full ownership in April 2023, we operate a fabless business whereby we make sales of complementary SAW resonators,
RF filters, crystal Xtal resonators and oscillators, and ceramic products addressing opportunities in multiple end
markets, such as automotive and industrial applications. We also offer back-end semiconductor supply chain services through our wholly
owned subsidiary, GDSI, which we acquired in January 2023. 

We expect to continue to incur substantial costs
for commercialization of our technology on a continuous basis because our business model involves materials and solid-state device technology
development and engineering of catalog and custom filter design solutions. To succeed across our combined portfolio of Akoustis, XBAW,
and RFMi products, we must convince customers in a wide range of industries including mobile phone OEMs, RFFE module manufacturers, network
infrastructure OEMs, Wi-Fi CPE OEMs, medical device makers, and defense customers to use our products in their systems and modules. For
example, since there are two dominant BAW filter suppliers in the industry that have high-band technology, and both utilize such technology
as a competitive advantage at the module level, we expect customers that lack access to high-band filter technology will be open to engage
with our company for XBAW filters. 

To help drive our XBAW filter business, we plan
to continue to pursue RF filter design and R D development agreements and potentially joint ventures with target customers and other
strategic partners, although we cannot guarantee we will be successful in these efforts. These types of arrangements may subsidize technology
development costs and qualification, filter design costs, and offer complementary technology and market intelligence and other avenues
to revenue. However, we intend to retain ownership of our core XBAW technology, intellectual property, designs, and related improvements.
Across our combined portfolio of Akoustis, XBAW, and RFMi products, we expect to continue development of catalog designs for multiple
customers and to offer such catalog products in multiple sales channels.

Business Environment and Current Trends 

Impact of New Export Control Regulations 

On October 17, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of Industry and Security BIS announced updates to export control regulations, originally issued on October 7, 2022,
regarding the sale of certain products and services related to advanced computing items, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and items
that can support end uses related to the development and production of advanced-node integrated circuits and semiconductor manufacturing
equipment, among others. The updated rules modify and expand restrictions on the sale of products and the provision of certain services
by U.S. persons to some companies and domestic fabs located in certain countries, including China, without prior U.S. governmental authorization. 

Semiconductor Shortages and Supply Chain Issues 

The global silicon semiconductor industry continues
to experience a shortage in supply and difficulties in ability to meet customer demand. This shortage has led to an increase in lead-times
of production of semiconductor chips and components. As our business depends in significant part upon manufacturers of products requiring
semiconductors, as well as the current and anticipated production of these products, we have sought to manage the impact of supply shortages
though carefully maintaining and increasing key inventory levels. In some cases, we have incurred higher costs to secure available inventory,
or have extended our purchase commitments or placed non-cancellable orders with suppliers, which introduces inventory risk if our forecasts
and assumptions are inaccurate. We believe the global supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our business and financial results
will persist through calendar year 2024. We expect these constrained supply conditions to increase our costs of goods sold and increase
uncertainty with respect to the timing of delivery of specific customer orders. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). Certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly
important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment
by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of
our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, our management uses its
judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on
our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, our observance
of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. 

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services
is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. Product sale revenue is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on individual
customer terms and conditions. Back-end wafer processing and supply chain services supplied by GDSI is generally recognized at a point
in time, either on shipment or delivery of the serviced material back to the customer. On NRE contracts, the majority of the contracts
include language which provides for an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, rather than upon completion of
the contract. NRE revenue is generally recognized over the period during which the work is performed using a formula that accounts for
the actual costs or expenses incurred, which generally include labor cost, fabrication and materials, as a percentage of total estimated
budget for the completion of the NRE contract. 

We apply a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing
of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract;
(3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing
revenue when the corresponding performance obligation is satisfied. 

Our revenue recognition accounting methodology
contains uncertainties because it requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions and to apply judgment. For example, for revenue
related to Non-Recurring Engineering NRE contracts, we recognize revenue over time as work is completed and typically
use an input measure such as costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. We must exercise
judgment and use estimates in order to determine the total estimated costs to complete the contract as well as the progress against the
contract. 

If we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could
cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue or deferred revenue that we report in a particular period. Refer to Note
3, Summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Report for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies.

Goodwill Impairment Testing 

In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles
- Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ), goodwill is not amortized, but rather is reviewed for impairment at the reporting
unit level at least annually, or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. 

Under ASC 350, the Company has the option to first
assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including
goodwill. In performing qualitative assessments, the Company considers the following factors which could trigger a goodwill impairment
review: (i) deterioration in general economic conditions or changes in market competitiveness; (ii) significant changes in the cost factors
such as raw materials or labor; (iii) changes in planned use of the assets; (iv) a significant decline in the Company s stock price for
a sustained period; and (v) a significant change in the Company s market capitalization relative to its net book value. 

If qualitative assessments conclude that it is
more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying value, quantitative assessments are performed
on the applicable reporting units. The quantitative assessments consider both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value
of a reporting unit. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rate used to determine the present value
of future cash flows is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific
characteristics and the uncertainty related to the ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The market approach utilizes comparable
public company information, key valuation multiples, and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash
flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable. 

The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to
changes in management s estimates and assumptions, the most sensitive of which are the revenue growth rate, discount rate and valuation
multiples. Therefore, in some instances, changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater
than its carrying value. Ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting
unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. Additionally, a reporting unit s carrying value
could change based on market conditions, change in the underlying makeup of the reporting unit, or the risk profile of those reporting
units, which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. If actual results of the reporting units
are not consistent with its estimates or assumptions, the Company may be required to record future non-cash impairment charges related
to goodwill that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations. During the years ended
June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized goodwill impairments of 8.1 million and zero, respectively. For additional information, refer to
Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Long-lived Assets 

We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, property, plant and
equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
such assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include: (i) significant under-performance
relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets
or the strategy for our overall business, or (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends. The process of evaluating the potential
impairment of long-lived assets under the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets is also highly subjective
and requires significant judgment. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about
the future prospects of our business or the part of our business to which the long-lived assets relate. We also consider market factors
specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business, which requires significant judgment as it is
based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we
determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long-lived assets stated on our consolidated balance
sheets to reflect their estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and
often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as the real estate market, industry and
economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions
and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact
our reported financial results. During the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized long-lived assets impairments of 35.4 million
and zero, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Report.

Results of Operations 

Our results of operations are presented for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. 

Year Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Year
Ended June 30, 2023 

Revenue 

The Company recorded revenue of 27.4 million
for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to 27.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase of 0.3 million was primarily
due to an increase in revenue from fabrication services of 2.2 million or 24 , which includes revenue from GDSI. This was partially
offset by a decrease in RF product revenue, which includes revenue from sales of RFMi products, of 1.9 million or 11 . 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue includes direct labor, material,
net realizable value (NRV) adjustments, and facility costs primarily associated with foundry services revenue, manufacturing of filter
products and engineering services. The Company recorded cost of revenue of 28.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared
to 30.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The 2.1 million decrease is primarily due to costs associated with RF product revenue
which decreased by 3.9 million or 16 , which includes cost of revenue from sales of RFMi products. This was offset by an increase in
costs associated with fabrication services, which includes GDSI, of 1.8 million or 33 . 

Research and Development Expenses 

R D expenses were 30.0 million for the year
ended June 30, 2024 and were 3.2 million, or 9.6 lower than the prior year amount for the same period of 33.2 million. Personnel costs,
including stock-based compensation, were 13.3 million compared to 16.5 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 3.2 million
or 19.4 . Facility costs, including depreciation, of 10.2 million primarily associated with the NY Facility were 2.4 million higher
than the prior period. Lastly, R D material costs were 2.5 million lower than the prior period. 

 General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative G A expenses include
salaries and wages for executive and administrative staff, stock-based compensation, professional fees, insurance costs and other general
costs associated with the administration of our business. G A expenses for the year ended June 30, 2024 were 35.9 million, which
is an increase of 6.1 million compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. Year-over-year changes within G A expenses include an increase
in general expenses of 8.2 million, primarily professional fees and intangible amortization as well as an increase in depreciation and
amortization of 1.1 million offset by a decrease in employee compensation (including stock-based compensation) of 3.6 million. 

Other Operating Expenses 

Other operating expense for the year ended June
30, 2024 was 43.4 million, compared to other operating expense of 0.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The expense increase
of 43.4 million was primarily due to an increase in fixed asset impairments of 35.4 million and goodwill impairment of 8.1 million. 

Other Income/(Expense) 

Other expense for the year ended June 30, 2024 was 58.0 million compared
to other income of 0.1 million in fiscal year 2023. The 58.1 million increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in expense
related to litigation related contingent liabilities of 57.4 million and an increase in interest expense of 0.3 million and a 0.3 million
decrease in income related changes in contingent liabilities and derivative liabilities. 

Net Loss 

The Company recorded a net loss of 167.9 million
for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 63.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The year-over-year incremental
loss of 104.3 million, or 164.0 , was primarily driven by an increase in other operating expenses related to property plant and equipment
impairment of 35.4 million and goodwill impairment of 8.1 million, an increase in expense due to litigation related contingent liabilities
of 57.4 million, an increase in professional fees and intangible amortization of 9.2 million as well as a decrease in the income tax
benefit of 2.5 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in R D and G A personnel costs, including stock based
compensation of 6.8 million, and a decrease in cost of revenue of 2.2 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 

We are experiencing financial and operating challenges.
In the absence of additional financing or our timely appeal of the recent judgment and awards relating to the Qorvo Litigation, we will
be forced to seek protection by filing a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. 

The Company has incurred losses and negative cash
flow from operations since inception. Our operations thus far have been funded primarily with sales of equity and debt securities, as
well as contract research and government grants, revenue from customers, foundry services and engineering services. In November 2023,
we announced that we had undertaken significant expense reductions and cost-saving measures to reduce our operating cash flow burn. As
a result of these cost-savings initiatives, the operating expenditures supporting the future growth of our manufacturing capabilities
and expansion of our product offerings have decreased, along with decreases in research and development and headcount costs. 

The Company s short-term and long-term liquidity
requirements primarily arise from funding (i) research and development expenses, (ii) general and administrative G A expenses including salaries, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation, (iii) working capital requirements, (iv) business acquisitions
and investments we may make from time to time, including potential performance based payments related to our acquisition of RFMi and a
note payable issued in connection with our acquisition of GDSI, and (v) interest and principal payments related to our 44.0 million aggregate
principal amount of outstanding convertible notes. Additionally, due to the outcome of the Qorvo Litigation and the judgments against
the Company for damages and legal fees, the Company s liquidity is severely constrained. These matters raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of this filing. 

The Company had 24.4 million of cash and cash
equivalents on hand as of June 30, 2024, which reflects a decrease of 18.7 million compared to 43.1 million as of June 30, 2023. The
 18.7 million decrease is primarily due to 40.3 million of cash used in operating activities and cash used for purchases of machinery
and equipment of 6.0 million. Partially offsetting these cash uses was cash proceeds from issuance of common stock of 12.3 million,
proceeds from the Customer Note (as defined below) of 8.0 million and proceeds from the exercise of warrants of 7.3 million. 

Recent Financing Activity 

On January 29, 2024, the Company closed an underwritten public offering
of 23,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of 0.50 per share pursuant to an underwriting agreement with Roth Capital
Partners, LLC. The shares of common stock issued at closing included 3,000,000 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters over-allotment
option, which was exercised in full. Gross proceeds totaled 11.5 million before deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses
of approximately 1.1 million resulting in net proceeds from the offering of approximately 10.4 million. Certain of the Company s
directors, officers and employees participated in the offering by purchasing an aggregate of 1.0 million of shares on the same terms
and conditions as other investors. 

On May 22, 2024, the Company entered into a securities
purchase agreement and placement agency agreement with Roth Capital Partners, to issue and sell an aggregate of 10,500,000 shares of its
common stock, and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 39,500,000 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering. The offering
price was 0.20 per share and 0.199 per pre-funded warrant. Under the placement agency agreement, the Company agreed to pay the Placement
Agent an aggregate cash fee equal to 6.0 of the aggregate gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the securities and
to reimburse the placement agent for up to 50,000 of expenses. The closing of the offering occurred on May 24, 2024. Gross proceeds were
approximately 10.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The prefunded
warrant was treated as equity and is included in Additional paid in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 

On June 26, 2024, the Company issued a secured note (the Customer
Note in the original principal amount of 8.0 million issued by the Company to a key customer. The Customer Note does not bear
interest and is subject to periodic repayment against sales made to the customer. The Customer Note is secured by certain of the Company s
assets.

Balance Sheet and Working Capital 

June 30, 2024 Compared to June 30, 2023 

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had current assets
of 36.8 million made up primarily of cash on hand of 24.4 million. As of June 30, 2023, current assets were 59.8 million comprised
primarily of cash on hand of 43.1 million. The reduction in current assets was primarily a result of the use of cash in operations. 

Property, Plant and Equipment was 12.9 million
as of June 30, 2024 as compared to a balance of 57.8 million as of the year ended June 30, 2023. The 44.9 million year-over-year decrease
is primarily due to the purchase of equipment for the NY Facility of 3.8 million offset by investment tax credits of 3.2 million, depreciation
of 10.1 million and an asset impairment charge of 35.4 million. 

Total assets as of June 30, 2024 and June
30, 2023 were 69.7 million and 148.9 million, respectively. The 79.2 million decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash of
 18.7 million, along with decreases in property, plant and equipment of 44.9 million, inventory of 5.3 million, goodwill of 8.1
million, accounts receivable of 0.8 million, intangibles of 2.7 million, and other current assets of 1.4 million offset by an
increase in investment tax credit receivable of 3.2 million. 

Current liabilities as of June 30, 2024 were 84.4
million and increased year-over-year by 66.8 million which was primarily due to the increase in litigation related contingent liabilities
of 57.4 million and increases in notes payable of 10.0 million offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 0.6
million, primarily due to decreases in employee compensation accruals and professional fee accruals. 

Long-term liabilities totaled 42.5 million as
of June 30, 2024, compared to 45.1 million for the prior year period. This decrease was a result of decreases in derivative and contingent
liability valuations offset by increases in notes payable. 

Stockholders equity (deficit) was (57.1)
million as of June 30, 2024, compared to 86.2 million as of June 30, 2023. Additional paid-in-capital APIC was 381.3
million as of June 30, 2024 and increased by 24.8 million compared to June 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to
an increase from net proceeds of 12.3 million for the issuance of Common Stock during the year, stock based compensation in the amount
of 2.8 million, and Common Stock issued for the exercise of warrants of 7.3 million. The 143.3 million decrease in stockholders 
equity consisted primarily of the 24.8 million increase in APIC reduced by the 167.9 million net loss recorded for the year ended June
30, 2024 along with the 0.2 million reduction from the cumulative-effect adoption of ASU 2016-13. 

Cash Flow Analysis 

Year Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the
Year Ended June 30, 2023 

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was 40.3
million during the year ended June 30, 2024 and 44.8 million for the 2023 comparative period. The 4.5 million year-over-year decrease
in cash used was attributable to an increase in revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses associated with the ramp up of commercialization
activities, higher spend on G A costs for support personnel, and professional fees. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was
 6.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to 25.1 million for the comparative year ended June 30, 2023. The 19.1
million year-over-year decrease was primarily due to decreased spend on R D and manufacturing equipment of 5.4 million along
with a 13.9 million decrease in cash used for investment in a subsidiary. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was 27.7 million for the
year ended June 30, 2024 versus 32.6 million for the 2023 comparative period. The 4.9 million decrease was due to a decrease in proceeds
from issuance of common stock of 19.7 million compared to the prior period, offset by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of warrants
of 7.3 million and proceeds from issuance of notes payable of 8.0 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 

Akoustis Technologies, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Akoustis
Technologies, Inc. (the Company as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
in stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2024, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 2, the Company has a significant working capital
deficiency, has incurred significant losses, has significant pending litigation and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations
and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an
audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that:
(1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken
as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter
or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

F- 2 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

The Company recorded an impairment
charge related to long-lived assets of 35.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets
may not be fully recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating
or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before
the end of its useful life. The Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When
testing for impairment of assets held for use, the Company groups assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.
If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount
of the asset. 

We identified the impairment
of long-lived assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to determine the undiscounted cash
flows and related fair values of the impaired assets. This required a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and an increased
extent of effort, including the need to involve our valuation specialists when performing audit procedures over the fair value of the
impaired assets and to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions related to future revenues and cash
flows. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed
in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to management s
judgments underlying the impairment charge on long-lived assets included the following, among others: 

Obtained an understanding of the design of controls associated with management s process for recording
long-lived assets impairment charge. 

Tested for the appropriate application of accounting guidance related
to the impairment of long-lived assets, including judgments made by management related to the asset group subject to impairment. 

Tested the significant assumptions such as revenue growth rates underlying
the undiscounted cash flows analysis including performing a sensitivity analysis of the impact of certain assumptions on the estimates. 

Assessed the qualifications of management s valuation specialists. 

With the assistance of our valuation specialists: 

o Evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodologies; 

o Tested mathematical accuracy of the calculation; 

o Evaluated the reasonableness of the key inputs and assumptions utilized
in the personal property analysis including: source data, cost indices for each asset category, depreciation, functional and economic
obsolescence method and depreciation floor values, normal useful life source and selected lives/remaining live, depreciation floor sources,
and adjustments to market data; 

o Evaluated the reasonableness of the land sale conclusion and depreciated
replacement cost of the building and site improvements used by the Company to estimate fair values, by comparing them to our independently
developed ranges of comparable land sales and estimated depreciated replacement cost of the building and site improvements for a selection
of real estate asset acquisitions; and 

o Evaluated the reasonableness of the Company s improved sales
conclusion by comparing it to our independently developed ranges of improved comparable sales. 

Tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the valuation to test that the inputs were accurate
and complete. 

Evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impairment of long-lived assets to assess their
conformity with the applicable accounting standards.

AKOUSTIS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

, and effective December 15, 2016, the Company changed
its state of incorporation to the State of Delaware. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Akoustis, Inc. (a Delaware corporation), the
Company, headquartered in Huntersville, North Carolina, is focused on developing, designing, and manufacturing innovative radio frequency RF filter products for the wireless industry, including for products such as smartphones and tablets, cellular infrastructure
equipment, Wi-Fi Customer Premise Equipment CPE ), and military and defense communication applications. Located between
the device s antenna and its digital backend, the RF front-end RFFE is the circuitry that performs the analog signal
processing and contains components such as amplifiers, filters and switches. To construct the resonator devices that are the building
blocks for its RF filters, the Company has developed a family of novel, high purity acoustic piezoelectric materials as well as a unique
microelectromechanical system MEMS wafer semiconductor process, collectively referred to as XBAW technology. The
Company leverages its integrated device manufacturing IDM business model to develop and sell high performance RF filters
using its XBAW technology. Filters are critical in selecting and rejecting signals, and their performance enables differentiation
in the modules defining the RFFE. Additionally, through RFM Integrated Device, Inc. RFMi ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Akoustis, Inc., the Company makes sales of complementary surface acoustic wave SAW resonators, RF filters, crystal (Xtal)
resonators and oscillators, and ceramic products branded as RFMi products. We also offer back-end semiconductor supply
chain services through our wholly owned subsidiary, Grinding Dicing Services, Inc. GDSI ), which we acquired in January
2023. 

million and working capital deficit of million.
In the absence of additional liquidity, the Company anticipates that its existing cash resources, with a continued focus on cash conservation,
is sufficient to fund its operations into the third quarter of fiscal 2025. There is no assurance that the Company s projections
and estimates are accurate. On May 17, 2024, after a trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in the matter of Qorvo
Inc. vs. Akoustis Technologies, Inc. DE Case 1:21-cv-01417-JPM (the Qorvo Litigation ), the jury in the Qorvo Litigation
awarded Qorvo approximately million in damages. On September 9 and 10, 2024, the District Court issued orders awarding Qorvo an
aggregate of approximately in attorneys fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. Although, as of the date of this Report,
the District Court has not entered a final judgment in respect of the jury verdict in the Qorvo Litigation, and Akoustis may elect to
appeal such final judgment and portions of the awards of attorneys fees and pre- and post-judgment interest, these matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of this filing. Our ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity financing or other capital or to timely
appeal the District Court s judgment and awards. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. If we elect not to appeal an adverse final judgment or the awards of attorneys fees and
pre- and post-judgment interest, or if we are unable to post an undertaking (such as an appeal bond) to enable us to do so, we will likely
be forced to pursue a reorganization proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

continuing declines in its stock price which led it to conclude that a triggering event had occurred and therefore the Company performed

percent), the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form
of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to ultimately be recoverable. In this process, certain relevant
criteria are evaluated including: the amount of income or loss in prior years, the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used
to absorb deferred tax assets, future expected taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Changes in taxable income,
market conditions, U.S. or international tax laws, and other factors may change the Company s judgment regarding whether the Company
will be able to realize the deferred tax assets. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets

Product Sales 

Product sales revenue consists of sales of RF
filters, which are primarily sold with contract terms stating that title passes, and the customer takes control, at the time of shipment.
Revenue is then recognized when the devices are shipped, and the performance obligation has been satisfied. If devices are sold under
contract terms that specify that the customer does not take ownership until the goods are received, revenue is recognized when the customer
receives the goods.

The Company recorded depreciation expense of 
million and million for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated
on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging
from years to years and buildings and improvements over periods up to years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when conditions
exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse
changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current
expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses
to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which
cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated as the difference between the
estimated fair value, utilizing cost and market approaches, and the carrying value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value
is an exit price concept that assumes an orderly transaction between willing market participants and is required to be based on assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. 

During the June 2024 quarter, the continued decline
in stock price and reduction in operating cash flow forecasts led the Company to conclude that an indicator of impairment existed for
the RF Filters Segment. The Company performed a recoverability test on the long-lived assets in the RF Filters Segment Filter
Assets in which the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the Filter Assets are compared to the carrying value
of those assets and determined that the Filter Assets are not considered recoverable. 

The Company then determined the fair value of
the of the Filter Assets under an orderly liquidation scenario utilizing a market and cost approach. The resulting fair value of the Filter
Assets of million was below the carrying amount of the Filter Assets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge against
property plant and equipment of million for the year ended June 30, 2024 which is included in operating expenses in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. 

As of June 30, 2024, equipment with a net book value totaling 
million had not been placed in service and therefore was not depreciated during the period. As of June 30, 2023, fixed assets with a net
book value totaling million had not been placed in service and therefore was not depreciated during the period. 

F- 16 

million in cash and approximately million of shares of the Company s common stock. In addition, the Company
issued a secured promissory note (the Promissory Note in the original principal amount of million issued by the Purchaser
to the Sellers representative. The Sellers representative is a current employee of the Company. The Promissory Note does
not bear interest, is subject to partial prepayment (reduction of the outstanding principal amount down to million) on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, and is payable in full on the third anniversary of the Closing Date. The Purchaser can reduce the principal
amount of the Promissory Note to satisfy the Sellers indemnification obligations under the Purchase Agreement, and if GDSI s
President is terminated for cause or due to disability or resigns without good reason prior to maturity the Promissory Note will be cancelled
in its entirety. The Promissory Note is secured by certain of the Purchaser s and GDSI s assets. In the event of certain events
of default, including failure to pay amounts due under the Promissory Note and certain bankruptcy events, the outstanding principal amount
of the Promissory Note will become immediately due.

The fair value of the trade names acquired was
determined based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method which estimated the value of the intangible
asset by discounting the future cash flows of the asset to present value. Key inputs include a royalty rate of and a discount rate
of as of the valuation date. The acquired trademarks assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful

asset by discounting the future cash flows of the asset to present value. Key inputs include a royalty rate of and a discount rate
of as of the valuation date. The acquired developed technology assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated

The fair value of the customer relationships acquired
was determined based on an income approach using the multi-period excess earnings method in which the value of the intangible
asset is determined by discounting the future cash flows of the asset to present value. Key inputs include a discount rate of and
an attrition rate of as of the valuation date. These customer relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful life of . 

The fair value of the fixed assets acquired was
primarily determined using a cost approach and used the original cost of the asset as the key input. The acquired fixed assets are being
depreciated over their estimated useful life of years. 

The goodwill resulting from the acquisition of
GDSI, which has been recorded in the Fabrication Services segment, is attributed to synergies and other benefits that are
expected to be generated from this transaction and is not deductible for income tax purposes. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the
Company recorded acquisition costs associated with the acquisition of GDSI totaling million in General and administrative
expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Revenues included in the consolidated statement
of operations for the year ended June 30, 2023 from this acquisition for the period subsequent to the closing of the transaction was
approximately million. Loss from operations included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2023
from this acquisition for the period subsequent to the closing of the transaction was approximately million.

likely than not that the fair value of the Fabrication Services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value; therefore, there was no goodwill
impairment. However, for the RF Filters reporting unit, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the
reporting unit which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million (representing the entire goodwill assigned
to this reporting unit) and is included in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

During the fourth quarter year ended June 30,
2024, the Company did not identify any events or circumstances that would require an interim goodwill impairment test of the Fabrication
Services segment. 

 During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company
did not identify any events or circumstances that would require an interim goodwill impairment test. The Company does not amortize goodwill
as it has been determined to have an indefinite useful life. The carrying amount of goodwill as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 was

The Company analyzed the components of the convertible
notes for embedded derivatives and the application of the corresponding accounting treatment. This analysis determined that certain features
of the notes represented derivatives that require bifurcation from the host contract. The fair value of these components of million
was recorded as a debt discount and will be adjusted to fair value at the end of each future reporting period. The Company recorded total
debt discount and debt issuance costs of million, to be amortized over using an effective interest method. Debt discount
and debt issuance costs include the fair value of the embedded features at the issuance date of million and debt issuance costs paid
totaling million.

Nasdaq Stock Market notification 

On October 24, 2023, we received notification
from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, stating that the Company did not comply with the minimum
 bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Requirement ).
In accordance with Nasdaq listing rules, the Company was afforded 180 calendar days (until April 22, 2024) to regain compliance with the
Bid Price Requirement (the Initial Compliance Period ). To regain compliance, the closing bid price of Common Stock needed
to meet or exceed per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period. Since the Company did not
regain compliance by April 22, 2024, the Company requested, and was granted, an additional 180 calendar days to regain compliance with
Bid Price Requirement expiring October 21, 2024. 

On August 19, 2024, the Company received notice
from the Staff indicating that the bid price for the Common Stock had closed at or less per share for the 10-consecutive trading
day period ended August 16, 2024 and, accordingly, the Company is subject to the provisions contemplated under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii).
As a result, the Staff determined to delist the Common Stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market (the Delisting Determination ).
The Company has requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel to appeal the Delisting Determination. The
hearing request automatically stays any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any compliance period
granted by the Panel following the hearing. The Company s hearing has been scheduled for October 8, 2024. 

Additionally, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires
listed companies to maintain minimum stockholders equity of million. As of June 30, 2024, as reflected in the consolidated
balance sheet included in this Report, we had a negative stockholders equity and therefore may receive an additional delisting
notice from the Staff in respect of this deficiency.

Litigation, Claims and Assessments 

Qorvo Inc. vs. Akoustis Technologies, Inc.,
DE Case 1:21-cv-01417-JPM 

On October 4, 2021, the Company was named as a
defendant in a complaint filed by Qorvo, Inc. Qorvo in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging,
among other things, infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,522,018 the 018 Patent and U.S. Patent No. 9,735,755 the
 755 Patent ), false advertising, false patent marking, and unfair competition. The complaint alleges that the defendants
misappropriated proprietary information, made misleading statements about the characteristics of certain of its products, and sold products
infringing on certain of the plaintiff s patents. The plaintiff seeks an injunction enjoining the Company from the alleged infringement
and damages, including punitive and statutory enhanced damages, in an unspecified amount. The Company filed a motion to dismiss all of
the claims other than the direct patent infringement claims, but the court permitted the plaintiff to file an amended complaint which
the court subsequently determined was sufficient for pleading purposes. The Court denied the Company s motion in May 2022. The Court
held a claims construction hearing in November 2022, issuing its claim construction order on March 15, 2023. On February 8, 2023, Qorvo
filed a second amended complaint adding allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets, racketeering activities, and civil conspiracy.
Fact discovery closed on November 15, 2023 and expert discovery closed on January 26, 2024. 

On February 1, 2024, the Company filed a motion
for partial summary judgment in its favor with respect to Qorvo s claims of false advertising, false patent marking, unfair competition,
misappropriation of trade secrets, violation of the RICO Act, and civil conspiracy. In its motion, the Company also moved for summary
judgment in its favor regarding Qorvo s claim of infringement regarding its 755 Patent with respect to newer designs of certain
Company BAW filters. That same day, Qorvo filed a motion seeking partial summary judgment in its favor with respect to the Company s
defenses of invalidity regarding the 018 Patent and the 755 Patent. 

On February 9, 2024, the Company filed Motions
to Exclude Expert Testimony of Qorvo s damages expert. That same day, Qorvo filed Motions to Exclude Expert Testimony of the Company s
damages expert and one of the Company s technical experts. 

On April 25, 2024, the court granted the Company s
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment with respect to Qorvo s false patent marking and RICO claims, but denied the remainder of the
Company s motion. That same day, the court granted in part Qorvo s Motion to Exclude Testimony of one of Akoustis expert
technical witnesses. On April 30, 2024, the court denied each party s Motion to Exclude the Expert Witness Testimony of the other
party s damages expert.

million in damages. Following
the verdict, the Company filed post-trial motions seeking to (i) overturn the jury s damages award for trade secret misappropriation
and (ii) obtain a new trial on liability for patent infringement and regarding damages for trade secret misappropriation (or in the alternative,
remittitur regarding such damages (collectively, the Company Post-Trial Motions )). Qorvo filed four post-trial motions of
its own, including a motion for discretionary attorneys fees regarding the trade secret misappropriation claims. 

On September 9, 2024, the District Court issued
an Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiff s Motion for Attorneys Fees (the Attorneys Fees Order ).
The Attorneys Fees Order awarded Qorvo approximately million in attorneys fees (the Attorneys Fees Award ). 

On September 10, 2024, the District Court issued
an Order on Pre- and Post-Judgment Interest (the Judgment Interest Order and, together with the Attorneys Fees Order,
the Orders ). The Judgment Interest Order awarded Qorvo approximately million (the Judgment Interest Award 
and, collectively with the Damages Award and the Attorneys Fees Award, the Awards ). 

The Orders are not enforceable or appealable; instead, the Awards will
be included in the District Court s final judgment, which will also reflect the outcome of the Post-Trial Motions and Qorvo s
other post-trial motions. Once the District Court renders its final judgment, the Defendants and Qorvo will have thirty days within which
to challenge it (including the Awards) by filing a notice of appeal. If the Company elects to appeal the final judgment and posts an undertaking
(such as an appeal bond) within thirty days of entry of final judgment, the Awards would not be enforceable pending the exhaustion of
all appeals. A litigation related contingent liability of million was recognized related to these judgments. 

Akoustis Technologies, Inc. vs. Qorvo, Inc.,
TX Case 2:23-cv-00180-JRG-RSP 

On April 20, 2023, the Company filed a complaint
against Qorvo in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement by Qorvo of U.S. Patent No.
7,250,360 the 360 Patent ), a patent licensed exclusively to the Company by Cornell University. The complaint alleges
Qorvo s willful infringement of the Cornell patent and seeks remedies including enhanced damages and attorneys fees. On July
24, 2023, Qorvo filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. 

On August 11, 2023, Qorvo filed a motion to strike
Akoustis infringement contentions. On January 10, 2024, the Court denied Qorvo s motion to strike and Qorvo agreed to respond
to the Company s interrogatories and document requests relating to the accused products listed in the Company s infringement
contentions. 

In connection with the litigation, the Company
issued subpoenas to certain suppliers of Qorvo. On March 1, 2024, a supplier of Qorvo filed an inter partes review with the Patent Trial
and Appeal Board challenging the validity of the 360 Patent and, on April 17, 2024, Qorvo made a similar filing. 

On May 1, 2024, the Company filed a motion for
leave to amend its complaint to add Cornell University as a co-plaintiff, as well as a motion to compel financial discovery. 

The Company intends to vigorously pursue its claims
against Qorvo but can provide no assurance as to the outcome of these disputes. 

Resolution of each of the matters described above has been prolonged
and costly, and the ultimate result or judgment is uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings. An adverse
result in the matters described above would have a material adverse effect on the Company and its business and create an urgent need for
additional liquidity or result in the Company s seeking protection by filing a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy
Code. Even if ultimately settled or resolved in the Company s favor, the matters described above and other possible future actions
have resulted in significant expenses, diversion of management and technical personnel attention and disruptions and delays in the Company s
business and product development, and other collateral consequences. Any out-of-court settlement of the above matters or other actions
may also have an adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited
to, substantial expenses, the payment of royalties, licensing or other fees payable to third parties, or restrictions on its ability to
develop, manufacture, and sell its products. 

From time to time, the Company may become involved
in other lawsuits, investigations, and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses
against such other pending claims and intends to vigorously pursue them. While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes
of any such other pending actions, the Company believes the amount of liability, if any, with respect to such other pending actions, would
not materially affect its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Tax Credit Contingency 

The Company accrues a liability for indirect tax
contingencies when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount
of the loss. The Company reviews these accruals and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal
counsel and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company s views on the probable outcomes
of claims, suits, assessments, investigations or legal proceedings change, changes in the Company s accrued liabilities would be
recorded in the period in which such determination is made. 

 The Company s gross unrecognized indirect
tax credits totaled million as of June 30, 2024 and million as of June 30, 2023 and are recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as a long-term liability.

There were no transfers between Level 1, 2, or

The fair value of the embedded derivatives in
our convertible note that were classified as Level 3 in the table above were estimated using a with and without approach on a lattice
model framework with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined
in ASC 820. The significant inputs in the Level 3 measurement not supported by market activity include the probability and timing assessments
of expected future change of control events, the volatility of our share price and the discount rate used to present value future cash
payments under the convertible debt obligation. The development and determination of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements
and the fair value calculations are the responsibility of the Company s chief financial officer and are approved by the chief executive
officer.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS
ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

None. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Managements Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms
and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of June 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily
applies its judgment in evaluating the cost- benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded based upon the evaluation described above that, as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of such date due to the material weaknesses described below with respect to our internal control over
financial reporting. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Our management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June
30, 2024. Based on this assessment, we identified the following material weaknesses: 

- a material weakness in the design and implementation of access security and program change
management controls for certain financially relevant systems that ensure appropriate access to data and adequate system changes. 

- a material weakness in the design of a control as relates to the precision of the control
with respect to accrual of invoices in the appropriate accounting period. 

Notwithstanding the material weaknesses discussed
above, our management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present
in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. 

A control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of these
inherent limitations, management does not expect that our internal controls over financial reporting can prevent all error and all fraud.
Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. 

As we are not an accelerated filer 
under SEC rules, we are not required to provide an auditor s attestation of management s assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. 

Remediation Plan 

Remediation activities will include: 

During fiscal year 2025, the Company intends
to design and implement key controls to enhance control over financial system access in addition to
implementing enhanced system change management controls. 

During fiscal year 2025, the Company intends to improve the design of key controls to enhance the review of invoices processed after period
end to ensure proper timing. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, there
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting

 INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY

Exhibit 97.1 

AKOUSTIS
TECHNOLOGIES, Inc. 

Incentive-BASED
Compensation Recovery Policy 

1. Policy Purpose . The purpose of the Akoustis Technologies, Inc. (the Company Incentive-Based Compensation Recovery Policy (this Policy is to enable the Company to recover Erroneously Awarded
Compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement. This Policy is intended to comply with the
requirements set forth in Listing Rule 5608 of the corporate governance rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the Listing Rule and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, capitalized terms shall
have the meaning ascribed to such terms in Section 7 . This Policy shall become effective on December 1, 2023. Where the context
requires, reference to the Company shall include the Company s subsidiaries and affiliates (as determined by the Committee in its
discretion). 

2. Policy Administration . This Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board
(the Committee unless the Board determines to administer this Policy itself. The Committee has full and final authority
to make all determinations under this Policy. All determinations and decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this
Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company, its affiliates, its stockholders and Executive Officers.
Any action or inaction by the Committee with respect to an Executive Officer under this Policy in no way limits the Committee s
actions or decisions not to act with respect to any other Executive Officer under this Policy or under any similar policy, agreement or
arrangement, nor shall any such action or inaction serve as a waiver of any rights the Company may have against any Executive Officer
other than as set forth in this Policy. 

3. Policy Application . This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation received by a person:
(a) after October 2, 2023, and beginning service as an Executive Officer; (b) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the
performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation; (c) while the Company had a class of securities listed on a national securities
exchange or a national securities association; and (d) during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Accounting Restatement
Date. In addition to such last three completed fiscal years, the immediately preceding clause (d) includes any transition period that
results from a change in the Company s fiscal year within or immediately following such three completed fiscal years; provided ,
 however , that a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its
new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to twelve months shall be deemed a completed fiscal year. For purposes of this Section
3 , Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received in the Company s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure
specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs
after the end of that period. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to both a Financial Reporting Measure
vesting condition and a service-based vesting condition shall be considered received when the relevant Financial Reporting Measure is
achieved, even if the Incentive-Based Compensation continues to be subject to the service-based vesting condition. 

4. Policy Recovery Requirement . In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company must recover,
reasonably promptly, Erroneously Awarded Compensation, in amounts determined pursuant to this Policy. The Company s obligation to
recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on if or when the Company files restated financial statements. Recovery under
this Policy with respect to an Executive Officer shall not require the finding of any misconduct by such Executive Officer or such Executive
Officer being found responsible for the accounting error leading to an Accounting Restatement. In the event of an Accounting Restatement,
the Company shall satisfy the Company s obligations under this Policy to recover any amount owed from any applicable Executive Officer
by exercising its sole and absolute discretion in how to accomplish such recovery. The Company s recovery obligation pursuant to
this Section 4 shall not apply to the extent that the Committee, or in the absence of the Committee, a majority of the independent
directors serving on the Board, determines that such recovery would be impracticable and: 

a. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy
would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded
Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation,
document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the Stock Exchange; or 

b. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly
available to employees of the registrant, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Code. 

5. Policy Prohibition on Indemnification and Insurance Reimbursement . The Company is prohibited from
indemnifying any Executive Officer or former Executive Officer against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation. Further, the Company
is prohibited from paying or reimbursing an Executive Officer for purchasing insurance to cover any such loss. 

6. Required Policy-Related Filings . The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy
in accordance with the requirements of the Federal securities laws, including disclosures required by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filings. 

7. Definitions . 

a. Accounting Restatement means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance
of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct
an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result
in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 

b. Accounting Restatement Date means the earlier to occur of: (i) the date the Board,
a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if the Board action is not required,

court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 

c. Board means the board of directors of the Company. 

d. Code means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Any reference to a
section of the Code or regulation thereunder includes such section or regulation, any valid regulation or other official guidance promulgated

section or regulation. 

e. Erroneously Awarded Compensation means, in the event of an Accounting Restatement,
the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation previously received that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise
would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts in such Accounting Restatement, and must be computed without
regard to any taxes incurred or paid by the relevant Executive Officer; provided , however , that for Incentive-Based Compensation
based on stock price or total stockholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical
recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement: (i) the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation must be based
on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total stockholder return upon which the Incentive-Based
Compensation was received; and (ii) the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide
such documentation to the Stock Exchange. 

2 

f. Executive Officer means the Company s president, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge
of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making
function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. An executive officer of the Company s
parent or subsidiary is deemed an Executive Officer if the executive officer performs such policy making functions for the
Company. For the avoidance of doubt, Executive Officer includes, but is not limited to, any person identified as an executive
officer pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

g. Financial Reporting Measure means any measure that is determined and presented in
accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measure that is derived
wholly or in part from such measure; provided , however , that a Financial Reporting Measure is not required to be presented
within the Company s financial statements or included in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to qualify as
a Financial Reporting Measure. For purposes of this Policy, Financial Reporting Measure includes, but is not
limited to, stock price and total stockholder return. 

h. Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested
based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. 

i. Stock Exchange means the national stock exchange on which the Company s
common stock is listed. 

8. Acknowledgement . Each Executive Officer shall sign and return to the Company, within 30 calendar
days following the later of (i) the effective date of this Policy first set forth above or (ii) the date the individual becomes an Executive
Officer, the Acknowledgement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A , pursuant to which the Executive Officer agrees to be bound by,
and to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Policy. 

9. Committee Indemnification . Any members of the Committee, and any other members of the Board who
assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made with
respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable law and Company policy with
respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification
of the members of the Board under applicable law or Company policy. 

3 

10. Severability . The provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of
the law. To the extent that any provision of this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision
shall be applied to the maximum extent permitted, and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives
to the extent necessary to conform to any limitations required under applicable law. 

11. Amendment; Termination . The Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its sole and absolute
discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect the Listing Rule. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time. 

12. Other Recovery Obligations; General Rights . To the extent that the application of this Policy would
provide for recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation that the Company recovers pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other
recovery obligations, the amount the relevant Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company will be credited to the required recovery
under this Policy. This Policy shall not limit the rights of the Company to take any other actions or pursue other remedies that the Company
may deem appropriate under the circumstances and under applicable law. To the maximum extent permitted under the Listing Rule, this Policy
shall be administered in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code. 

13. Successors . This Policy is binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and their beneficiaries,
heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. 

14. Governing Law; Venue . This Policy and all rights and obligations hereunder are governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any choice of law rules or principles that may direct
the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. All actions arising out of or relating to this Policy shall be heard and determined
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court declines to exercise jurisdiction or if subject matter
jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of any such legal action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the U.S. Federal courts,
the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware.
