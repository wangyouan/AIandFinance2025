10,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value 0.0001 per share and 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per
share, which issuance was exempt from the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act under Section 4(2) of such same said
act. The value of the stock provided to Mr. Uetaki, based on the par value of .0001 per share of common stock and Series A Preferred
Stock, is valued at 2,000.

Overview 

We operate through our wholly owned subsidiary, World
Scan Project Corporation, a Japanese Company. We are an industrial automation equipment manufacturer in start-up stage currently focused
on developing and designing robots, drones, Web3 infrastructure, IoT equipment and other related products. Our operations currently span
across the globe. 

Our principal executive offices are located at 2-18-23,
Nishiwaseda, Shinjuku-Ku, Tokyo, 162-0051, Japan. 

The Company s website is https://www.world-scan-project.com/. 

The Company has elected October 31th as its year end. 

SkyFight-X Drone Business 

SkyFight-X, which was originally developed and designed
by our Chief Executive Officer, specifically for the hobbyist drone race known as SKY FIGHT , which is organized by Drone
Net, a Japanese Company. Drone Net began running a drone school in 2017, and a drone race in 2019. Our CEO, Ryohei Uetaki, was in the
planning stages of a new small sized drone product, and believed that his products would have higher performance capabilities than the
drones at the time used by Drone Net, which prompted him to propose collaboration between the Company and Drone Net. Currently, Drone
Net administrates 16 racetracks in Japan, specifically designed for drone use. 

Although SkyFight-X was designed for Sky Fight, the drones can also be
used outside the facilities designed exclusively for drone racing, and they can be used for recreational and miscellaneous purposes. 

The following includes details regarding the SkyFight-X which we currently
offer for sale. As mentioned later on, we have plans to expand our reach to more customers, but at this time it should be noted our only
customer is Drone Net.

Structure
of Operations of SkyFight-X 

At present, the Company s operations are carried out in the following
manner: 

(1) The Company receives an order for the Company s products from
Drone Net. 

In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, entered into on March
1, 2020, Drone Net shall not develop, manufacture, purchase or sell similar products to SkyFight-X without the Company s consent
through February 28, 2023. 

(2) The Company places orders to G-Force, Inc., a Japan corporation G-Force to manufacture the Products, in accordance with the terms outlined in the agreement entered into on March 4, 2020. 

(3) G-Force purchases lap measuring sensors (the Sensors from ShenZhen RadioMaster Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation RadioMaster ). The sensors are later installed in the SkyFight-X
Drones. 

(4) The Sensors are installed into the drones manufactured by G-Force on
behalf of the Company. 

(5) G-Force manufactures the Products and installs the Sensors. G-Force
is a non-exclusive OEM supplier of the Company. After completion of the production process, the Company conducts a final product inspection
of the goods produced. During the inspection, on average, the Company physically inspects between five to ten percent of the products
for quality control. 

(6) Following inspection and acceptance of the products, the Company directs
G-Force to deliver the products to a location designated by Drone Net, currently the warehouse of Drone Net in Toyko, Japan, and G-Force
delivers the Products directly. 

(7) The Company relies on the marketing and sales of Drone Net, in part
for its own success. If Drone Net realizes increased demand for the products, then in turn our own operations will increase. It should
be noted that, at present, Drone Net is our primary customer. 

Marketing 

Our marketing plan, at present, is not yet complete and is still being
researched and developed. SkyFight-X, our current primary product, is being marketed solely by our primary customer, Drone Net. We believe
that Drone Net s sales of our products will result in increased demand, from Drone Net, for future products, but this is not directly
related to any marketing activities conducted by the Company itself. We do not currently engage in any marketing efforts, with the exception
of the company s website located at: https://www.world-scan-project.com/

ZEXABOX 

 ZEXABOX
is made pursuant to, what we believe to be, strict Japanese guidelines for quality. The device is a GPU Mining Rig, comprised of computer
components, used to mine digital currency. In layman s terms, mine is defined as the process of solving
complex math problems that verifying transaction(s) in the digital currency or blockchain, which, generally speaking, results in a predetermined
amount of digital currency to be gained. 

As
of October 31, 2023 , the company offers for sale the following types of Zexabox machines:
PRO, MINI, ULTIMA, DIV, ULTIMA EX, PRO TYPE- C, DIV , and DIV . 

Current
Operations Relating to Zexabox 

Sales
activities pursuant to ZEXABOX are outsourced to 3 rd party marketing companies in Japan.
All products are purchased from Web3 Computing Corp., formerly known as Cellessence Corp., an unrelated third party. The company
does not carry inventory related to the ZEXABOX. Installation services for the products are conducted by Web3
Computing Corp. 

Marketin g 

Sales
and marketing activities pursuant to ZEXABOX are outsourced to 3 rd party marketing companies
in Japan . At present, company s marketing activities are constrained to our company website located at: https://www.world-scan-project.com/,
through which recent news and updates are released, and general advertising to direct potential customers to our website. Additionally,
from time to time the company attends industry specific exhibitions and trade shows. 

Future
plans 

World
Scan Project, Inc., as an industrial automation equipment manufacturer, plans to further develop and apply our technologies in designing/developing
Web3 infrastructure, IoT equipment (Zexabox) and other related products, in addition to the robots and drones we have been offering to
the market globally. 

(1) 
To begin direct sales to consumers in Japan 

The
Company has tentative plans to evaluate the possibility of directly selling its products via web-based direct sales in Japan. It is possible
that we may evaluate, and even begin to do so in 2024, but we do not currently have any definitive plans to do so at this point in time. 

(2) To
 expand the sales volume for our digital currency mining rigs 

The
Company is planning to gain sales agents and agencies to expand the sales of its new product named XEXABOX series. 

(3) 
To start selling products overseas, mainly in the USA 

The
Company has intentions to begin developing its own sales agencies, and at such time to begin to sell products through such agencies,
overseas beginning, potentially, in 2023. These plans remain speculative in nature, however, in order to begin to progress these efforts,
the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Pine Hill Productions, Inc., a New York corporation (Pine Hill on March
3, 2020. Pine Hill shall support the Company to expand its business operations into the USA. The consulting fee due to Pine Hill is 3,000
per month. As of October 31, 2023, there has been no material progress to disclose as pertains to this agreement. 

(4) 
To sell new products 

The
Company intends to sell core products other than drones and digital currency mining rigs. 

(5) 
The Company also has tentative plans, to evaluate the possibility of working on developing an underwater drone and a hover bike (flying
bike). At this time, we are developing a scanner device that can be attached to an underwater drone and used to scan the sea floor, and
the hover bike has been successfully tested in flight. The underwater 3D robot is called MURAKUMO, and the Hovercraft bike is called
FREAP. At present neither of these potential products are available for sale as testing remains ongoing. However. we are still exploring
the feasibility of these endeavors, and there is no guarantee that such plans will come to fruition. 

Government
Regulations in Japan 

Currently,
given that the entirety of our operations are conducted within Japan, and our customers reside in Japan, only the rules and regulations
pertaining to drones within Japan are presently applicable to the Company s operations. 

Based
on the revised Civil Aeronautics Act of 2020, registration of Unmanned Aircraft has been mandated. Based on the amendment to the Civil
Aeronautics Act in 2020, unregistered Unmanned Aircraft flights will be banned. From June 20, 2022, Unmanned Aircraft will have to be
marked with a registration ID to identify them and be fitted with a Remote ID function. The exclusion for Unmanned Aircraft was changed
from those weighing less than 200g to those weighing less than 100g. This means that all Unmanned Aircraft
of 100g or more are subject to registration. Acceptance of pre-registration began on December 20, 2021 and mandatory registration of
all unmanned aircrafts began on June 20, 2022. The registration system for Unmanned Aircraft has been established to ensure safety and
security in the expanded use of Unmanned Aircraft. While this regulation does not directly impact our ability to conduct any of our operations,
it has placed the burden of registering autonomous drones onto the consumer, which we believe has had, and will continue to have, a detrimental
impact upon our sales.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

As
of October 31, 2023 we had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 5,698,883. Currently, our cash balance is sufficient to fund our
operations without the need for additional funding. 

Revenues 

We recorded revenues of 30,986,882
for the year ended October 31, 2023. We recorded revenues of 29,440,341 for the year ended October 31, 2022. 

Net Income(Loss) 

We recorded net loss of 3,416,587
for the year ended October 31, 2023. We recorded a net income of 8,908,782 for the year ended October 31, 2022. 

Cash flow 

For
the year ended October 31, 2023, we had negative cash flows used in operations in the amount of 170,461 as compared to cash flow provided
by operations of 4,605,591 for the year ended October 31, 2022. The decrease in operating cash flow is attributed to the net operating
loss during this this period, mainly due to R D expenses (see Note 10). For year ended October 31, 2023, we had negative cash flows
from investing activities in the amount of 1,627,412, due mainly to the purchase of investment securities, as compared to cash flow used
in investing activities of 227,180 for the year ended October 31, 2022. For the year ended October 31, 2023, we had cash flows provided
by financing activities in the amount of 1,862,361, due to the sale of common shares (see Note 12) and deposits received for subscriptions
of shares prior to registration, as compared to cash flow provided by financing activities of 0 for the year ended October 31, 2022. 

Going Concern 

The Company s
financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern that contemplates
the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company
demonstrates mixed trends, compared with the previous fiscal years, in our financial statements as in below: 

As
of October 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of 6,608,501, a decrease of 3,089,176 (-32 as compared to working capital of
 9,697,677 as of October 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company recorded cash and cash equivalents of 5,698,883, a decrease of 137,182
as compared to 5,836,065 in the prior year period ended October 31, 2022, The Company s comparable liquidity to prior year
is derived from increased sales of crypto miners and drone products and the sale of common shares (see Note 12), which balance out increased
expenditures in research and development (see Note 10). As
stated in the consolidated financial statements, the Company, for the year ended October 31, 2023, recorded a net loss of 3,416,587 (-138.35 
y-o-y) and used 170,461 (-101.01 y-o-y) in cash flows from operating activities. The change in net profit(loss), use of cash from
operations, and decrease in working capital is mainly related to a large increase in research and development costs expensed in the year
ended October 31, 2023 (see Note 10). 

Having reviewed the above, the Company
realizes that whether we shall be able to continue demonstrating the positive trends demonstrated in our previous financial statements,
lies in our ability to continue to generate revenue and increase revenue going forward. Principally, the Company's consolidated financial
statements are based on going concern assumptions, which assume the realization of assets and offset of liabilities in the normal course
of business. Based on this, the Company also recognizes that it is critical for us to continue to operate and/or perform our obligation(s)
in the future and procure any required funds needed to meet the redemption of its debt during normal business operations. 

Management has evaluated the estimated
impact of COVID-19, which has become a significant factor impacting operations of businesses globally, one of which we believe we will
need to continue to monitor as to the potential effects it may have on our own business. 

The Company assessed the impact of
COVID-19 and believes there to be minimal impact of COVID-19 on the Company s crypto miner sales, which is currently the Company s
primary source of revenue. The Company will need to continue to monitor COVID-19 and the effects it may have, socially and economically,
as it is possible that such developments may in fact impact our operations going forward or more specifically, our sales results. At this
time, the Company believes that it will not affect our assumptions as a going concern. 

Based on the
Company s evaluation and considering the positive financials trends the Company has experienced for many previous quarters, management
believes that the one-time R D expense this quarter will not adversely impact the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
World Scan Project, Inc. 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of World Scan Project, Inc. and its subsidiary (the Company as of October 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements
based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matters communicated below are
matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relates. 

Research and Development Expense 

As discussed in Notes 2 and 10 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company records expenses for research and development activities based on Management s estimates of services
received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on the Company s behalf.
The financial terms vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows as compared with services performed or products
delivered. As a result, the Company is required to estimate research and development expenses incurred during the period, which impacts
the amount of Advance payments and prepaid expenses balances related to such costs as of each balance sheet date. Management estimates
the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and the contract research and contract manufacturing entity as
to the progress or stage of completion of the services. The Company s estimates are based on a number of factors, including the
Company s knowledge of the status of each of the research and development project milestones. Management makes significant judgments
and estimates in determining the accrued balance at the end of each reporting period. The Company incurred Research and Development expenditure
totaling 18,717,456 in respect of various technologies mainly for two products Company intends to offer for sale in the future during
the year ended October 31, 2023. All the technologies were in progress as on October 31, 2023, and all the expenditure incurred till year
end was expensed in accordance with ASC 985 Software Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Marketed and ASC 730
 Research and Development Costs . Subsequent to year ended October 31, 2023, the Company has made a capitalization in accordance
with ASC 985 Software Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Marketed . Such capitalization has been made by the
Company considering the fact that the Net realizable value/Future Economic Benefits exceeds unamortized cost. 

The principal considerations for our determination
that performing procedures related to management's assessment of recognizing Research and Development expenditures constitutes a critical
audit matter include: (i) the significant judgment exercised by management in determining the recognition and accounting treatment of
such costs; (ii) the higher degree of auditor judgment required in evaluating the results of audit procedures, due to the subjectivity
and estimation uncertainty involved; and (iii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skills and expertise in assessing the
appropriateness of the related estimates. 

Addressing this matter involved performing procedures
and evaluating audit evidence as part of forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included:
(i) inquiring with Company personnel responsible for overseeing the research and development activities to understand the progress of
these activities, including project milestones and contract terms; (ii) discussing management's underlying assumptions regarding future
economic benefits and treatment of such Research and Development cost; and (iii) Analyzing the terms of contracts between the Company
and its contract research and manufacturing organizations, reviewing correspondence between the Company and these organizations regarding
project completion status. We used this information to develop an independent estimate of the Advance payments and prepaid expenses and
compared it to the amounts recorded by the Company. 

Revenue Recognition 

As discussed in Note 2 and 9 of the financial statements,
the Company acted as an agent in facilitating the sales of crypto miners, produced by a third-party manufacturer, to customers of the
Company during the year ended October 31, 2023. Net revenue for the sale of such products was recognized when the products were delivered
to the customers and the customers completed the inspection of the same. Management assessed the Company s contracts with the third-party
manufacturer and customers in consideration of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and determined the Company
as the agent in said transactions. 

We
identified the recognition of revenue as a critical audit matter. H igher degree of auditor judgement
is required in relation to Management s assessment for revenue recognition and transfer of significant risk rewards associated with
the sale of crypto miners. 

Addressing this matter involved performing procedures
and evaluating audit evidence as part of forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included
(i) reviewing and analyzing the relevant contractual terms with the third-party manufacturer; (ii) evaluating the Company s assessment
of the transfer of inventory risk and rewards; and (iii) inquiries and discussions with Management in relation to Company s responsibility
to act as an agent.

as compared to in the prior year period ended October 31, 2022, The Company s comparable liquidity to prior year
is derived from increased sales of crypto miners and drone products and the sale of common shares (see Note 12), which balance out increased
expenditures in research and development (see Note 10). As
stated in the consolidated financial statements, the Company, for the year ended October 31, 2023, recorded a net loss of (-138.35 
y-o-y) and used (-103.7 y-o-y) in cash flows from operating activities. The change in net profit(loss), use of cash from

ended October 31, 2023 (see Note 10). 

Having
reviewed the above, the Company realizes that whether we should be able to continue the positive trends demonstrated in our previous financial
statements lies in our ability to continue to generate revenue and increase revenue going forward. Principally, the Company's consolidated
financial statements are based on going concern assumptions, which assume the realization of assets and offset of liabilities in the normal
course of business. Based on this, the Company also recognizes that it is critical for us to continue to operate and/or perform our obligation(s)

Management has evaluated the estimated
impact of COVID-19, which has become a significant factor impacting operations of businesses globally, one of which we believe we will
need to continue to monitor as to the potential effects it may have on our own business. 

The Company assessed the impact of
COVID-19 and believes there to be minimal impact of COVID-19 on the Company s crypto miner sales, which is currently the Company s
primary source of revenue. The Company will need to continue to monitor COVID-19 and the effects it may have, socially and economically,
as it is possible that such developments may in fact impact our operations going forward or more specifically, our sales results. At this
time, the Company believes that it will not affect our assumptions as a going concern. 

Based
on the Company s evaluation and considering the positive financials trends the Company has experienced for many previous quarters,
management believes that the one-time R D expense this quarter will not adversely impact the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. 

The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

The Company
conducts its major businesses in Japan through WSP Japan and is subject to tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities,

The realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in future periods. The
Company regularly assesses the ability to realize its deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not
that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company weighs all available positive and negative evidence, including
its earnings history and results of recent operations, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. 

The amount of
the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward
period are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional
weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Company s projections for growth. The adjustments of a valuation allowance
against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in the effective tax rate in the periods in which the valuation allowance is
adjusted. For the year ended October 31, 2023, certain valuation allowance was released for WSP Japan considering the collectability of
deferred tax assets. 

As of October
31, 2023, WSP Japan had net operating losses which can be carried forward for income tax purposes of 75,904 to reduce future taxable
income. If not used, these carryforwards will expire in 2033.

Lease ROU assets

lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes any lease incentives. When readily determinable, we use the implicit
rate in determining the present value of lease payments. When leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing
rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including the lease term.

Item 9. Changes in and
Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

On January 17, 2024, World
Scan Project Inc. s (the Company independent registered public accounting firm, M K CPAS, PLLC MK resigned effective immediately. 

The report of MK on the Company s
consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 included in the Company s annual report on Form
10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified
as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle, except that such report expressed substantial doubt regarding the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

During the fiscal years ended
October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the subsequent interim period through January 17, 2024, there were no (1) disagreements (as defined in
Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the Company and MK on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which would have caused it to make reference to the subject
matter of such a disagreement in connection with its audit reports on the Company s financial statements for such years, or (2)
reportable events (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 

On May 7, 2024, the Board
of Directors approved the engagement of Mercurius Associates LLP (PCAOB ID: 3223) as the Company s independent registered
public accounting firm for the audit of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023, and any reviews of interim periods thereafter. 

During the fiscal years ended
October 31, 2022 and 2021 and through October 31, 2023, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted with Mercurius Associates
LLP regarding (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion
that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company
that Mercurius Associates LLP concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting,
auditing or financial reporting issue, or (2) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv)
of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under
the Exchange Act, such as this annual report, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules of the SEC. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated
and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the
Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based
on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Office who also serves as our Principal Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls
and procedures are ineffective. 

Our Chief Executive Officer, Ryohei Uetaki, has reviewed
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period covered by the report October 31, 2023 and has concluded that (i) the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
are not effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission, and (ii) the Company s controls and procedures have not been
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The Company s management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued in 2013. Based on the assessment, management concluded
that, as of October 31, 2023, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is ineffective based on those criteria. 

The Company s management, including its Chief
Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that the breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because
of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the
process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

The matters
involving internal controls and procedures that our Chief Executive Officer considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of Treadway Commission were: domination of management by a single individual without adequate
compensating controls, lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors, inadequate segregation of duties consistent with
control objectives, lack of well-established procedures to identify, approve and report related party transactions, and lack of an audit
committee. 

Management believes
that the material weaknesses did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning
audit committee and inadequate segregation of duties results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required
internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

Management recognizes
that its controls and procedures would be substantially improved if we had an audit committee and two individuals serving as officers
and as such is actively seeking to remediate this issue. 

Management s Remediation Initiatives 

In an effort to remediate the identified material
weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

We have increased our personnel resources and technical
accounting expertise to remediate material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. We plan to appoint one or more outside
directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who
will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving
estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us. 

Management believes that the appointment of one or
more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee
and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. 

We will work as quickly as possible to implement these
initiatives; however, the lack of adequate working capital and positive cash flow from operations will likely slow this implementation. 

Changes in Internal Control 

There have been no changes in internal controls over
the financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal fourth quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s
report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC
that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.

project Corporation. 

Due to Mr. Ichikawa s technological experience,
the Board has determined it is in the best interest of the company to appoint him as the company s Chief Technology Officer. 

Ethics 

The Company promotes accountability for adherence
to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents
that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other public communications made by the
Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally adopted a
written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company's employees, officers and directors as the Company is not required
to do so. 

In lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company's board
of director(s) (the "Board of Directors" or "Board"), is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company's financial statements
and other services provided by the Company's independent public accountants. The Board of directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Company's internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees of the Board 

Our Company currently does not have nominating, compensation,
or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee
charter. Our sole director believes that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the director(s) can adequately
perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit Committee Financial Expert 

Our director has determined that we do not have a
board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do
we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the FINRA Rules. 

We believe that
our director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for
financial reporting. The director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management
believes that the Board of directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that retaining
an independent director who would qualify as an " audit committee financial expert " would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our officers
and sole director have not been involved in or a party in any of the following events or actions during the past ten years: 

1. 
 any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); 
 
 3. 
 being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or 
 
 4. 
 being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 
 
 5. 
 Such person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or 
 
 8. 
 Such person was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence
of Directors 

We are not required
to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such time as we are required
to do so. 

Code of Ethics 

We have not
adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Director(s) evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and determined
that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal, business
conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand in the future,
we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our Company
does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors. The
Board of Director(s) believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Director(s) will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A shareholder
who wishes to communicate with our Board of Director(s) may do so by directing a written request addressed to our sole Director Ryohei
Uetaki, at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement. 

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s
executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company s equity
securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of the Company s common stock.
 Such officers, directors and persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
that they file with the SEC. 

Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms
that were received by the Company, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5s were required for those persons,
the Company is not aware of any failures to file reports or report transactions in a timely manner during the Company s fiscal year
ended October 31, 2023. 

Procedure for Nominating Directors 

In 2022and 2023 we have not made any material changes
to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors. 

Family Relationships 

There are no family relationships among our directors,
executive officers or persons nominated to become executive officers or directors. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

During the past ten (10) years, none of our directors,
persons nominated to become directors, executive officers, promoters or control persons was involved in any of the legal proceedings listen
in Item 401 (f) of Regulation S-K. 

Arrangements 

There are no arrangements or understandings between
an executive officer, director or nominee and any other person pursuant to which he was or is to be selected as an executive officer or
director.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 

Director Compensation 

The Board of Directors reserves the right in the future
to award the members of the Board of Directors cash or stock based consideration for their services to the Company, which awards, if granted
shall be in the sole determination of the Board of Directors. 

Executive Compensation Philosophy 

Our Board of Directors determines the compensation
given to our executive officers in their sole determination. Our Board of Directors reserves the right to pay our executive or any future
executives a salary, and/or issue them shares of common stock issued in consideration for services rendered and/or to award incentive
bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive officer s performance. This package may also
include long-term stock based compensation to certain executives, which is intended to align the performance of our executives with our
long-term business strategies. Additionally, while our Board of Directors has not granted any performance base stock options to date,
the Board of Directors reserves the right to grant such options in the future, if the Board in its sole determination believes such grants
would be in the best interests of the Company. 

Incentive Bonus 

The Board of Directors may grant incentive bonuses
to our executive officer and/or future executive officers in its sole discretion, if the Board of Directors believes such bonuses are

owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of
the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares is deemed
to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of
outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual voting power at
any particular date.
