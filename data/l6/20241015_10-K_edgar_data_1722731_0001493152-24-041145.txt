Covid-19 

In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic throughout the United States.
While the initial outbreak concentrated in China, it spread to several other countries, including Russia and Cyprus, and infections were
reported globally. Many countries worldwide, including the United States, have implemented significant governmental measures to control
the spread of the virus, including temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other
material limitations on trade. These measures have resulted in work stoppages, absenteeism in the Company s labor workforce, and
other disruptions. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments. These developments
are highly uncertain. We cannot predict them with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak and the actions required
to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact. In particular, the spread of the coronavirus globally could adversely impact our operations
and workforce, including our marketing and sales activities and ability to raise additional capital, which could harm our business, financial
condition, and operation results.

Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events. 

The
Company is building a diversified global financial services company driven by proprietary Condor trading technologies, complementary
regulatory licenses, and a proven executive team. The Company plans to acquire, integrate, transform, and scale legacy financial service
companies. The Company believes its proprietary technology and software development capabilities allow legacy financial services companies
immediate exposure to forex, stocks, ETFs, commodities, digital assets, social/copy trading, and other high-growth fintech markets. 

From
December 2021 onwards, the Company expects to grow from its acquisition strategy, specializing in buying and integrating small to mid-size

These developments are highly uncertain. We cannot predict them with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak
and the actions required to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact. In particular, the spread of the coronavirus globally could
adversely impact our operations and workforce, including our marketing and sales activities and ability to raise additional capital,

present value of the lease payments over the lease term, adjusted for lease incentives, initial direct costs, and any lease payments
made at or before the commencement date. As of December 31, 2023, the ROU: 39,683. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value
of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the Company s incremental borrowing rate (10.00 at the lease commencement date.
The Operating Lease Liability was estimated to be 36,419 current and 3,264 noncurrent. The lease expense for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2023, consists of an operating lease expense of 42,390. The Company has included all rental expenses in the General and

not to be exercised. 

The
discount rate of 10.00 used to measure the lease liabilities was determined based on the Company s incremental borrowing rate,
as the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. 

The
Company incurred 1,512,790 and 382,864 in sales, marketing, and advertising costs sales and marketing for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The sales and marketing costs increased in fiscal 2023 due to an increase in sales and marketing expenses related to margin brokerage business. During fiscal

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

On
December 31, 2023, and 2022, we had a cash balance of 31,316,461 and 264,829, respectively. At December 31, 2023, and 2022, the working
capital surplus and deficit were 11,260,603 and 345,269, respectively. The increase in the working capital surplus was mainly due to
the acquisition of AML and APL, resulting in the increase of current assets over current liabilities as of December 31, 2023. 

We
generate a substantial portion of our operating income outside the United States, and this income is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested
in foreign jurisdictions. Consequently, as outlined under Cash and Cash Equivalent, the majority of our cash and short-term
investments are held by our foreign subsidiaries. At present, we do not intend to repatriate these funds and do not foresee a need to
do so. 

We
anticipate that our existing domestic cash, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our domestic
operating activities and fulfill our cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt
repayments, and capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

Should
we require additional capital in the United States beyond what our domestic operations generate for instance, to fund significant
discretionary activities such as business acquisitions or share repurchases we could choose to repatriate future earnings from
foreign jurisdictions or raise capital within the United States through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives may result in higher
effective tax rates, increased interest expenses, or dilution of our earnings. We have previously borrowed funds domestically and believe
that we can continue to do so at reasonable interest rates. 

In
the next twelve (12) months, the Company will continue investing in sales, marketing, product development, new technology solutions,
and existing technology support to serve our customers. We expect capital expenditure to increase to 500,000 in the next twelve (12)
months to support the growth, including working capital, software development, sales marketing, and purchasing computers and servers. 

We
expect the combination of existing cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and access to private equity and capital markets
to be sufficient for at least twelve (12) months. The availability of funds will fund our operating activities to meet the need for investing
and financing, such as debt maturities and material capital expenditures. However, we may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable
sales level to fund our ongoing operations out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or,
if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. 

Should
we require additional capital, the Company s operations are insufficient to fund its capital requirements. The Company may attempt
to restructure Notes, refinance existing Notes with financial institutions, or raise capital by selling additional capital stock or debt
issuance. The Company intends to continue growing its operations and raising funds through private equity and debt financing.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

We
have based our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operations results on our financial statements,
which we have prepared following the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In preparing our financial statements, we
are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Our actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material. 

We
have described significant accounting policies in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our 10-K/A for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on May 5, 2023. We continuously evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (together,
the Certifying Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Certifying Officers or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-
15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of our company, 

(2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
and directors, and 

(3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

25 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated
financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness in future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on December 31, 2023. Based on our assessments,
management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, due to the
material weakness in our internal controls due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel
and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping. 

Management
intends to implement remediation steps to improve our internal controls due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes
due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping.
We plan to further improve this process by enhancing the size and composition of our board upon the closing of the business, identifying
third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the
requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals and implemented additional layers of reviews in the
internal controls and financial reporting process. 

This
Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth
company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, that has materially
affected or is reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting materially.

29 

Term
of Office 

All
directors serve until the next annual meeting; their successors are elected and qualified. Officers are appointed to serve for one year
until the board of directors meeting, followed by the stockholders annual meeting, and until the directors successors
have been elected and qualified. 

Director
of Independence 

Our
board of directors is currently composed of four (4) members, out of which three (3) directors are executive directors and who do not
qualify as independent directors by the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market (the Company has no plans to list
on the NASDAQ Global Market). The third non-executive director is an independent director. The NASDAQ independence definition includes
a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three (3) years, one of our employees and
that neither the director nor any of his family members have engaged in various types of business dealings with us. Also, our board of
directors has not made a subjective determination as to our director that no relationships exist, which, in the opinion of our board
of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. However,
the NASDAQ rules require such subjective determination. Had our board of directors made these determinations, they would have reviewed
and discussed the information provided by directors and us concerning our director s business and personal activities and relationships
as they may relate to us and our management. 

Audit
Committee and Conflicts of Interest 

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that such committees would have performed
are performed by our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee, does not have an audit committee
financial expert, nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board believes such committees are unnecessary
since the Company is an early start-up company with only three (3) directors. To date, such directors have been performing the functions
of such committees. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our three (3) directors and officers have the authority to
determine issues concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions. 

There
are no family relationships among our directors or officers other than as described above. We are unaware of any other conflicts of interest
with our executive officers or directors. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

No
director, person nominated to become a director, executive officer, promoter, or control person of our Company has, during the last ten
(10) years, (i) been convicted in or is currently subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
offenses); (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of
such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities
subject to any federal or state securities or banking or commodities laws including, without limitation, in any way limiting involvement
in any business activity, or finding any violation to such law, nor (iii) any bankruptcy petition been filed by or against the business
of which such person was an executive officer or a general partner, whether at the time of the bankruptcy or for the two (2) years prior
thereto. 

Stockholder
Communications with the Board of Directors 

We
have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our board of directors. Nevertheless,
every effort will be made to ensure that the board hears the views of stockholders of directors and that the appropriate responses are
provided to stockholders promptly. Our board of directors will continue to monitor whether it would be relevant to adopt such a process
during the upcoming year.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 FDCTECH, INC. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FDCTECH, INC (the Company as of December 31, 2023, and
2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash
flows for each of the two years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
 financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the two years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of (2,643,647). These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans with regards to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the financial
statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. Communication of critical audit matters does not alter in
any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters, providing
separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Covid-19 

In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic throughout the United States.
While the initial outbreak concentrated in China, it spread to several other countries, including Russia and Cyprus, and reported infections
globally. Many countries worldwide, including the United States, have implemented significant governmental measures to control the spread
of the virus, including temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other material
limitations on trade. These measures have resulted in work stoppages, absenteeism in the Company s labor workforce, and other disruptions.
The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments. These developments are highly uncertain.
We cannot predict them with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak and the actions required to contain the coronavirus
or treat its impact. In particular, the spread of the coronavirus globally could adversely impact our operations and workforce, including
our marketing and sales activities and ability to raise additional capital, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operation
results.

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

The
Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2019. The Company
presents results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019, under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are reported following
legacy GAAP. In addition to the above guidelines, the Company also considers implementation guidance on warranties, customer options,
licensing, and other topics. The Company considers revenue collectability, methods for measuring progress toward complete satisfaction
of a performance obligation, warranties, customer options for additional goods or services, nonrefundable upfront fees, licensing, customer
acceptance, and other relevant categories. 

The
Company accounts for a contract when it and the customer parties have approved the agreement and are committed to fulfilling
their obligations. Each party can identify its rights, obligations, and payment terms; the contract has commercial substance. The Company
will probably collect all of the consideration. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control
of the promised service to a customer. The Company fixes the transaction price for goods and services at contract inception. The Company s
standard payment terms are generally net 30 days and, in some cases, due upon receipt of the invoice. 

The
Company considers the change in scope, price, or both as contract modifications. The parties describe contract modification as a change
order, a variation, or an amendment. A contract modification exists when the parties approve a modification that either creates new or
changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. The Company assumes a contract modification by oral agreement or implied by the
customer s customary business practice when agreed in writing. If the parties to the contract have not approved a contract modification,
the Company continues to apply the existing contract s guidance until the contract modification is approved. The Company recognizes
contract modification in various forms partial termination, an extension of the contract term with a corresponding price increase,
adding new goods or services to the contract, with or without a corresponding price change, and reducing the contract price without a
change in goods/services promised. 

At
contract inception, the Company assesses the solutions or services, or bundles of solutions and services, obligated in the contract with
a customer to identify each performance obligation within the contract and then evaluate whether the performance obligations are capable
of being distinct and distinct within the context of the agreement. Solutions and services incapable of being distinct and distinct within
the contract context are combined and treated as a single performance obligation in determining the allocation and recognition of revenue.
For multi-element transactions, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone
selling price basis. The Company determines the stand-alone selling price for each item at the transaction s inception involving
these multiple elements. 

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Since
January 21, 2016 Inception ), the Company has derived its revenues mainly from consulting services, technology solutions,
and customized software development. The Company recognizes revenue when it has satisfied a performance obligation by transferring control
over a product or delivering a service to a customer. We measure revenue based on the considerations outlined in an arrangement or contract
with a customer. 

The
Company s typical performance obligations include the following: 

Performance
 Obligation 
 
 Types
 of Deliverables 
 
 When
 Performance Obligation is Typically Satisfied 
 
 Consulting
 Services 
 
 Consulting
 related to Start-Your-Own-Brokerage SYOB ), Start-Your-Own-Prime Brokerage SYOPB ), FX/OTC liquidity
 solutions and lead generations. 
 
 The
 Company recognizes the consulting revenues when the customer receives services over the contract length. If the customer pays the
 Company in advance for these services, the Company records such payment as deferred revenue until the Company completes the services. 

Technology
 Services 
 
 Licensing
 of Condor Risk Management Back Office Condor Risk Management ), Condor FX Pro Trading Terminal, Condor Pricing Engine,
 Digital Assets Platform Digital Assets Web Trader Platform ), and other digital assets-related solutions. 
 
 The
 Company recognizes ratably over the contractual period that the services are delivered, beginning on the date such service is made
 available to the customer. Licensing agreements are typically one year in length with an option to cancel by giving notice; customers
 have the right to terminate their agreements if the Company materially breaches its obligations under the agreement. Licensing agreements
 do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software. The Company charges the customers a set-up fee for installing
 the platform, and implementation activities are insignificant and not subject to a separate fee. 

Software
 Development 
 
 Design
 and build development software projects for customers, where the Company develops the project to meet the design criteria and performance
 requirements as specified in the contract. 
 
 The
 Company recognizes the software development revenues when the Customer obtains control of the deliverables as stated in the Statement-of-Work
 contract. 

The
Company assumes that the goods or services promised in the existing contract will be transferred to the customer to determine the transaction
price. The Company believes that the contract will not be canceled, renewed, or modified; therefore, the transaction price includes only
those amounts to which the Company has rights under the present contract. For example, if the Company enters a contract with a customer
with an original term of one year and expects the customer to renew for a second year, the Company will determine the transaction price
based on the initial one-year period. When choosing the transaction price, the company first identifies the fixed consideration, including
non-refundable upfront payment amounts. 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

To
allocate the transaction price, the Company gives an amount that best represents the consideration that the entity expects to receive
for transferring each promised good or service to the customer. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation
identified in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis to meet the allocation objective. In determining the standalone
selling price, the Company uses the best evidence of the stand-alone selling price that the Company charges to similar customers in similar
circumstances. The Company sometimes uses the adjusted market assessment approach to determine the standalone selling price. It evaluates
the market in which it sells the goods or services and estimates the price that customers in that market would pay for those goods or
services when sold separately. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when or as it transfers the promised goods or services in the contract. The Company considers the transfers 
the promised goods or services when the customer obtains control of the goods or services. The Company believes a customer obtains
control of an asset when it can directly use and substantially obtain all the remaining benefits from an asset. The Company recognizes
deferred revenue related to services it will deliver within one year as a current liability. The Company presents deferred revenue related
to services that the Company will provide more than one year into the future as a non-current liability. 

According
to the contract s terms and conditions, the Company invoices the customer at the beginning of the month for the month s services.
The invoice amount is due upon receipt. The Company recognizes the revenue at the end of each month, equal to the invoice amount. 

Wealth
Management 

AD
Advisory Services Pty (ADS), the Company s wealth management revenue, primarily consists of advisory revenue, commission revenue
from insurance products, fees to prepare the statement of advice, rebalancing portfolio, and other financial planning activities. ADS
is authorized and regulated by the Australian Securities Investments Commission (ASIC) to conduct licensing activities in Australia. 

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

ASC
606 establishes a five-step model for revenue recognition aimed at enhancing comparability and transparency across entities, industries,
and capital markets. The Company only recognizes revenue that reflects the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in exchange
for the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled. 

For
ADS, a contract is an agreement between ADS and a client that creates enforceable rights and obligations, encompassing advisory services,
insurance product commissions, and other financial planning activities. Contracts may be written, oral, or implied by customary business
practices and are identified when both parties approve the agreement; each party can identify rights regarding the goods or services
to be transferred, establish payment terms, the contract has commercial substance, and collection of payment is probable. 

A
performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the Customer. For ADS, performance obligations
may include: 

Providing
 ongoing financial advisory services, 
 
 Preparing
 statements of advice, 
 
 Executing
 portfolio rebalancing, 
 
 Facilitating
 the purchase of insurance products, and 
 
 Offering
 other specialized financial and estate planning services.

evaluate these services to determine if they are distinct, considering whether the Customer can benefit from the service on its own or
with other resources readily available to the Customer and if the promise to transfer the service is separately identifiable from other
promises in the contract. 

The
transaction price is the amount of consideration ADS expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services
to the Customer. These services include fixed fees, commissions from insurance products, and variable consideration for performance-based
fees. ADS estimates the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled in a manner that reflects the likelihood and magnitude
of a revenue reversal. 

If
a contract includes more than one performance obligation, ADS allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on
its standalone selling price. When standalone selling prices are not directly observable, ADS estimates them using methods that may include
cost-plus margin, market assessment, or residual approach, considering the Customer s perceived value of each service. 

ADS
recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when the control of the promised good or service is transferred
to the Customer. For ongoing services, revenue is recognized over time, reflecting the continuous transfer of services. For services
that are performed at a specific point in time, revenue is recognized when the service is completed. The pattern of revenue recognition
is determined based on when the Customer obtains control of the promised good or service, which for advisory services is typically throughout
the contract, and for transaction-based services (like insurance commissions or fees for specific planning activities), is at the point
in time when the transaction is executed, or the service is rendered. If we receive payments before services, we defer and recognize
them as revenue when satisfied with our performance obligation. Advisory revenue includes fees charged to clients in advisory accounts
for which we are the licensed investment advisor. We bill advisory fees weekly.

We
recognize Trading Revenue through the principal model following the guidance outlined in ASC 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers.
The Company primarily generates revenue through market-making and trading execution services for its clients, known as Trading Revenues.
The Trading revenue is the Company s largest source of revenue. Trading revenue comprises trading revenue from the retail OTC business

markets that do not prohibit such transactions), as well as other financial products. 

We
realize gains or losses when we liquidate customer transactions. We revalue unrealized gains or losses on trading positions at prevailing
market rates at the date of the balance sheet. We include them in Receivables from brokers, Payables to customers, and Payables to brokers
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record changes in net unrealized gains or losses in Trading Revenue on the Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss)/Income. We record Trading Revenue on a trade date basis.

operations. 

Significant
Acquisitions 

The
Company completed the Acquisition of of the issued and outstanding shares of Alchemy Prime Limited APL on November
30, 2023 Acquisition Date from Alchemy Prime Holdings Ltd. Seller or APHL ), through an exchange
for Series B preferred convertible stocks valued at . 

The
Company completed the Acquisition of the remaining of the issued and outstanding shares of Alchemy Markets Holdings Ltd (Alchemy
BVI) and its subsidiary Alchemy Markets Ltd (AML) on November 30, 2023 Acquisition Date ), from Alchemy Prime Holdings
Ltd., through an exchange for Series B preferred convertible stocks valued at . 

The
Company estimated the total purchase price for the Acquisition(s) or Transaction(s) to be . The Seller is a UK entity, with
Mr. Gope S. Kundnani Kundnani as the (sole) natural person holding one hundred percent shareholding in the APHL.
Kundnani is also a controlling shareholder in the Company, a related party. 

Further,
the Company, Kundnani, and the current management are responsible for making strategic and operational decisions for both APL and AML Targets ). 

As
there is no quoted market for Series B Preferred convertible stock, and the Acquisition of of the equity of APL and of AML
are related party transactions, we valued the exchange of shares of Series B Preferred convertible stock based on audited net
financial assets (book value) of the targets. 

The
net financial assets of APL were , and of AML was , with a total purchase price of for 
shares of Series B Preferred convertible stock or per share.

Under
ASC 805-50-15-6, based on the ownership of Kundnani and the management structure post-acquisition, we believe the following guidance
in the transactions between entities under common control subsections applies to combinations between entities or businesses under common
control: 

a) The
 Seller (APHL or Kundnani) transfers its controlling interest in APL and AML to the Company
 controlled by the Seller, directly or indirectly through his ownership as an individual or
 through APHL. This transaction is a legal organization change, but not the reporting entity.
 The reporting entity remains the Company. 

The
SEC staff s conclusions expressed during the deliberations in EITF 02-5 that common control exists between (or among) separate
entities in the following situations: An individual or enterprise holds more than 50 of the voting ownership interest of each entity.
A group of shareholders has more than 50 of the voting ownership interest of each entity, and contemporary written evidence of an agreement
to vote a majority of the entities shares in concert exists. Kundnani meets these criteria. 

We
have accounted for the Acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting per ASC 805, with the Company treated as the accounting
acquirer and Targets treated as the acquired Company for financial reporting purposes. We determine the Company an accounting
acquirer based on the following facts: (i) after the Acquisition(s), shareholders of the Company held the majority of the voting interest
of the combined Company; (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company possess majority control of the Board of Directors of the combined
Company; and (iii) members of the management of the Company are responsible for the management of the combined Company. As such, we have
treated the financial statements of the Company as the historical financial statements of the combined Company. The Company will present
consolidated or combined financial statements in place of financial statements of individual entities. 

We
have identified the Company as the legal acquirer, as it is the entity that issued securities. Comparatively, we have identified Targets
as the legal acquiree, the entity whose equity interests are acquired. 

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

We
have recognized Targets assets and liabilities as their carrying amounts in the combined financial statements of the controlling
party, the Company, immediately before the Acquisition. This approach does not necessitate a fair value adjustment or a recognition of
goodwill that would typically follow a standard business combination. Therefore, we have recorded assets and liabilities at book value. 

The
transaction s equity structure involves the issuance of Series B preferred convertible stock valued at and is reflected
in the Company s equity. 

The
post-acquisition consolidation process eliminates any existing intercompany transactions or balances between the Company and Target(s).
Although the initial recognition does not adjust assets and liabilities to fair value, the Company evaluates intangible assets in Target s
financial statements on December 31, 2023.

As
of December 31, 2020, the conversion features of conventional FRH Group convertible notes dated February 22, 2016, May 16, 2016, November
17, 2016, and April 24, 2017 (See Note 8) provide for a rate of conversion where the conversion price is below the market value. As a
result, the conversion feature on all FRH Group convertible notes has a beneficial conversion feature BCF to the extent
of the price difference. 

As
the Company and FRH Group extended the maturity date of the four (4) tranches of convertible notes to June 30, 2021, Management analyzed
the fair value of the BCF on these tranches. The Company noted that the value of the BCF for each note was insignificant; thus, it did
not record debt discounts as of December 31, 2020. 

For
FRH Group convertible note dated April 24, 2017, the stock s value at the issuance date was above the floor conversion price; this
feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature BCF ). The Company records a BCF as a debt discount pursuant
to ASC Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. As a result, the convertible debt is recorded net of the discount
related to the BCF. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has amortized the discount of to interest expense at the issuance date

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 840) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing
lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments to
this standard are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of the amendments in this standard is
permitted for all entities. The Company must recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified
retrospective approach. The Company adopted this policy as of January 1, 2020, and there is no material affect on its financial reporting. 

In
August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements
for Fair Value Measurement. The amendments modify the disclosure requirements in Topic 820 to add disclosures regarding changes
in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value
measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty. The amendments removed and modified certain disclosure requirements
in Topic 820. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. Certain amendments are to be applied prospectively, while others are to be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. 

The
Company adopted the ASU 2018-13 as of January 1, 2020. The Company used the Level 1 Fair Market Measurement to record, at cost, ADS 
intangible assets valued at . We evaluate acquired intangible assets for impairment at least annually to confirm if
the carrying amount of acquired intangible assets exceeds their fair value. The acquired intangible assets primarily consist of assets
under management, wealth management license, and our technology. We use various qualitative or quantitative methods for these impairment
tests to estimate the fair value of our acquired intangible assets. We will recognize an impairment charge for the difference if the
fair value is less than the carrying value. The Company did not record impairment for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. 

ASU
2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in
Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ,
issued in August 2020 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock by removing the requirements to
present certain conversion features in equity separately. In addition, the amendments also simplify the guidance in ASC Subtopic 815-40,
Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in Entity s Own Equity, by removing certain criteria that must be satisfied to classify a contract
as equity, which is expected to decrease the number of freestanding instruments and embedded derivatives accounted for as assets or liabilities.
Finally, the amendments revise the guidance on calculating earnings per share, requiring the use of the if-converted method for all convertible
instruments and rescinding an entity s ability to rebut the presumption of share settlement for instruments that may be settled
in cash or other assets. The amendments are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early
adoption is permitted, but no earlier than the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The guidance must be adopted as of the beginning
of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company does not expect this ASU 2020-06 to impact its condensed consolidated financial statements.

due in the ordinary course of business for twelve (12) months following December 31, 2023. For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023,
and 2022, the Company has earned increased revenues year-over-year and decreased operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue.
As a result, the Company continues to experience limited cash flows from operations and the ongoing requirement for substantial additional
capital investment to develop its financial technologies. The Management expects that it will need to raise significant additional capital
to accomplish its growth plan over the next twelve (12) months. The Management expects to seek additional funding through private
equity or public markets. However, there can be no assurance about the availability or terms such as financing and capital might be available.

To
the extent the Company s operations are insufficient to fund the Company s capital requirements, the Management may attempt
to enter into a revolving loan agreement with financial institutions or raise capital through the sale of additional capital stock or

consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates
that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of

Note

We
believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state NOL carryforwards will not be realized. If we realize NOL
carryforwards for in fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our taxable pre-tax income of will be loss of .
If our assumptions change and we determine that we will be able to realize these NOLs, the tax benefits related to any reversal of the
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, will be accounted for as follows: approximately will
be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense and will be recorded as an increase in equity. 

If
we are unable to realize the benefits of NOL carry forwards, in recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of 
on the deferred tax assets related to these state NOL carryforwards.

be recognized as interest expenses and other expense, respectively, in the consolidated financial statements. 

The
Company has identified the United States Federal tax returns as its major tax jurisdiction. The Company has submitted and
received acceptance of the United States Federal return for 2023 and 2022. The Company was not subject to tax examination by authorities
