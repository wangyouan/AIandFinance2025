Loan Originations and Repayments. We originate residential mortgage loans pursuant to underwriting standards that generally conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines. Loan origination activities are primarily concentrated in Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania. New loans are generated primarily from the efforts of employees and advertising, a network of select mortgage brokers, other parties with whom we do business, customer referrals, and from walk-in customers. Loan applications are centrally underwritten and processed at our corporate center. At September 30, 2024, 721.5 million, or 41.0 , of our loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential loans. Generally, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are originated in amounts up to 80 of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property, although loans may be made with higher loan-to-value ratios, including those that qualify for our First Time Home Buyers Program and Community First Loan Program. Private mortgage insurance is required to compensate for the risk. Fixed-rate loans are originated for terms of 10, 15, 20 and 30 years. 
 We also offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans which have initial fixed terms of one, three, five or seven-years before converting to an annual adjustment schedule based on changes in a designated United States Treasury index. We originated 7.1 million and 21.0 million in adjustable rate one- to four-family residential loans during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans provide for maximum rate adjustments of 200 basis points per adjustment, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 500 basis points. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans amortize over terms of up to 30 years. 
 Adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the risk associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically repricing but involve other risks. As interest rates increase, the principal and interest payments on the loan increase, thus increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Adjustment of the contractual interest rate is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustments specified by our loan documents and therefore, is potentially limited in effectiveness during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. At September 30, 2024, 61.5 million, or 8.5 , of our one- to four-family residential loans had adjustable rates of interest. 
 All one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we originate include a due-on-sale clause, which provides the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower sells or otherwise conveys title to the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. 
 Regulations limit the amount that a savings bank may lend relative to the value of the real estate securing the loan, as determined by an appraisal of the property at the time the loan is originated. For all purchase money loans, we utilize outside independent appraisers approved in accordance with the Bank s appraisal policy. All purchase money and most refinance loans require a lender s title insurance policy. Certain modest refinance requests may utilize an exterior inspection report and title search. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance. 
 5 

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generated by our loan originators. Eligible properties include primary and vacation homes located in Monroe, Northampton, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Lehigh, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania and secondarily in other Pennsylvania counties contiguous to our primary market area. As of September 30, 2024, home equity loans and lines of credit totaled about 51.3 million, or 2.9 of our loan portfolio. 
 The maximum combined loan-to-value originated is generally 80 although a maximum of 85 is permitted with more restrictive underwriting parameters depending on the collateral. There is a small portion of the portfolio originated in years past that contains original combined loan-to-values of up to 90 . Our home equity lines of credit typically feature a 10-year draw period with interest-only payments permitted, followed by another 20 years of fully amortizing payments with no further ability to draw funds. Similar combined loan-to-value characteristics and standards exist for the lines as are outlined above for the loans. 
 Loan underwriting standards limit the maximum size of a junior lien loan to between 10,000 and 500,000, depending on the loan type and collateral. All loans exceeding 75 of value require an appraisal by bank-approved, licensed appraisers. Loans up to 25,000 with lesser loan-to-value ratios may utilize an automated valuation model. Title/lien searches are secured on all home equity loans and lines. 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. At September 30, 2024, 884.6 million, or 50.3 , of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are secured by office and industrial buildings, multi-family, mixed-use properties and other commercial properties. We generally originate fixed rate commercial real estate loans with an initial term of five to seven years and a repricing option, and a maximum term of up to 25 years for existing properties and 30 years for new construction. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for most commercial real estate loans is 75 to 80 . 
 We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure that it is at least 120 of the monthly debt service. All commercial real estate loans in excess of 500,000 are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved in accordance with the Bank s Appraisal Policy. Personal guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate borrowers although we may occasionally waive this requirement given very strong loan to value and debt service coverage ratios. All purchase money and most asset refinance borrowers are required to obtain title insurance. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance. 
 Loans secured by commercial real estate generally are considered to present greater risk than one- to four-family residential loans. Commercial real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Repayment of these loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, the nature of these loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate. 
 First Mortgage Construction Loans. At September 30, 2024, 14.9 million, or 0.8 , of our total loan portfolio consisted of first mortgage construction loans. Our first mortgage construction loans are for the construction of residential properties. We currently offer fixed- and adjustable-rate residential first mortgage construction loans. First mortgage construction loans are generally structured for permanent mortgage financing once the construction is completed. First mortgage construction loans will generally be made in amounts of up to 80 of the appraised value of the completed property, or the actual cost of the improvements. First mortgage construction loans require only the payment of interest during the construction period. Once converted to permanent financing, they generally repay over a 30-year period. Funds are disbursed based on our inspections in accordance with a schedule reflecting the completion of portions of the project. 
 First mortgage construction loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than other one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. The risk of loss on a construction loan depends, in part, upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost of construction and the successful completion of construction within budget. 
 For all such loans, we utilize outside independent appraisers approved in accordance with the Bank s Appraisal Policy. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties. 
 6 

Commercial Loans. At September 30, 2024, 36.8 million, or 2.1 , of our loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans. We generally offer commercial loans to businesses located in our primary market area. The commercial loan portfolio includes lines of credit, equipment loans, vehicle loans, improvement loans and term loans. These loans are primarily secured by vehicles, machinery and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, marketable securities, deposit accounts and real estate. 
 Obligations of States and Political Subdivisions. At September 30, 2024, 48.6 million, or 2.8 , of our total loan portfolio consisted of loan transactions including tax and revenue anticipation notes, general obligation notes, and authority general revenue notes. The financial strength of the state or political subdivision, type of transaction, relationship efforts, and profitability of return are considered when pricing and structuring each transaction. 
 Auto Loans. At September 30, 2024, 65,000, or less than 0.1 , of our total loan portfolio consisted of auto loans. Although collateralized, these loans require stringent underwriting standards and procedures. Each loan decision is based primarily on the credit history of the individual(s) and their ability to repay the loan. Collision and comprehensive insurance is required and the Bank must be listed as the loss payee. As previously disclosed, the Bank discontinued originating indirect auto loans in July 2018. 
 Other Loans. We offer a variety of loans that are either unsecured or secured by property other than real estate. These loans include loans secured by deposits and personal unsecured loans. At September 30, 2024, these other loans totaled 1.9 million, or 0.1 , of the total loan portfolio. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower s ability to repay, we review each borrower s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. For all loans the Board has established a lending authority policy. Larger and more complex loan requests require the involvement of senior management or the Board. 
 Non-Performing Loans and Problem Assets 
 Performance of the loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by Bank management. A number of factors regarding the borrower, such as overall financial strength, collateral values and repayment ability, are considered in deciding what actions should be taken when determining the collectability of interest for accrual purposes. 
 When a loan, including a loan that is impaired, is classified as nonaccrual, the accrual of interest on such a loan is discontinued. A loan is typically classified as nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal. 
 Loans are usually restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. 
 Non-performing Loans. At September 30, 2024, 9.0 million, or 0.51 of our total loans, were non-performing loans. The majority of these loans were commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage loans. Non-performing commercial real estate loans totaled 6.4 million at September 30, 2024. Two loan relationships accounted for 5.1 million of the total non-accrual commercial real estate loans. Non-performing residential first mortgage loans totaled 2.0 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Real Estate Owned. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 3.2 million of real estate owned consisting of one property. This property is being actively marketed and additional losses may occur.

Classified Assets. Banking regulations and our Asset Classification Policy provide that loans and other assets considered to be of lesser quality should be classified as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss assets. An asset is considered Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as Loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. We classify an asset as Special Mention if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management s close attention. While such assets are not impaired, management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriorate, thereby adversely affecting the repayment of the asset. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company classified approximately 24.5 million of our assets as Special Mention, of which 23.7 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans, and 11.7 million as Substandard, of which 10.5 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans. No loans were classified Doubtful or Loss. At September 30, 2023, we classified approximately 4.3 million of our assets as Special Mention, of which 3.2 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans, and 14.3 million as Substandard, of which 12.7 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans. No loans were classified as Doubtful or Loss. 
 The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Our allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb credit losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for credit losses, considers the losses inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. The 
 9 

allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a quarterly basis by management, with assistance from a third-party provider and incorporates a discounted cash flow model utilizing various government and industry forecasts and is impacted by the size and composition of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. We maintain a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review (at least quarterly) of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential loans with credit loss. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers. Specific credit loss allowances are established for identified losses based on a review of such information. A loan evaluated for credit loss is considered to be have a credit loss when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans identified as having a credit loss are evaluated independently. We do not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes. Loan credit loss is measured based on the fair value of collateral method, taking into account the appraised value, any valuation assumptions used, estimated costs to sell and trends in the market since the appraisal date. The allowance is increased through provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loans that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. While management uses available information to recognize probable and reasonably estimable credit losses, future loss provisions may be necessary based on changing economic conditions. Payments received on individually evaluated loans with credit loss generally are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal. The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. 
 In addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board ), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The banking regulators may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their analysis and review of information available to them at the time of their examination.

We use the accrual method of accounting for all performing loans. The accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest previously credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans is either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to managements judgement as to the collectability of principal. Generally, residential and consumer loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and ultimate collectability of total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. Commercial loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and ultimate collectability of total contractual principal and interest no longer is in doubt. 
 In our collection efforts, we will first attempt to cure any delinquent loan. If a real estate secured loan is placed on nonaccrual status, it could be subject to transfer to the real estate owned REO portfolio (comprised of properties acquired by or in lieu of foreclosure), upon which our credit administration department will pursue the sale of the real estate. Prior to this transfer, the loan balance will be reduced, if necessary, to reflect its current market value less estimated costs to sell. Write downs of REO that occur after the initial transfer from the loan portfolio and costs of holding the property are recorded as other operating expenses, except for significant improvements which are capitalized to the extent that the carrying value does not exceed estimated net realizable value. 
 Fair values for determining the value of collateral are estimated from various sources, such as real estate appraisals, financial statements and from any other reliable sources of available information. For those loans deemed to be impaired, collateral value is reduced for the estimated costs to sell. Reductions of collateral value are based on historical loss experience, current market data, and any other source of reliable information specific to the collateral. 
 This analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment. 
 12 

Securities Activities 
 Our securities investment policy is established by our Board of Directors. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with our interest rate risk management strategy. Our investment policy is reviewed annually by our ALCO/Investment Management Committee. All policy changes recommended by this management committee must be approved by the Board of Directors. The Committee is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Banking Officer, Director of Consumer Lending, Chief Risk Officer, Senior Credit Officer, Regional President - Lehigh Valley. Authority to make investments under the approved guidelines is delegated by the Committee to appropriate officers. While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by the ALCO / Investment Management Committee, the execution of specific actions rests with the Chief Financial Officer and Controller. 
 The approved investment officers are authorized to execute investment transactions up to 5.0 million per transaction without the prior approval of the ALCO / Investment Management Committee and within the scope of the established investment policy. These officers are also authorized to execute investment transactions between 5.0 million and 10.0 million with the additional approval from the Chief Executive Officer. Each transaction in excess of 10.0 million must receive prior approval of the ALCO/Investment Management Committee. 
 Our current investment policy generally permits investments in debt securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and corporate debt obligations, as well as investments in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (federal agency securities) and, to a much lesser extent, other equity securities. Securities in these categories are classified as investment securities for financial reporting purposes. The policy also permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Government National Mortgage Association GNMA as well as commercial paper. Our current investment strategy uses a risk management approach of diversified investing in fixed-rate securities with short- to intermediate-term maturities, as well as adjustable-rate securities, which may have a longer term to maturity. The emphasis of this approach is to increase overall investment securities yields while managing interest rate risk. 
 Our policy is that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities that are available-for-sale or held for trading are reported at fair value, while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. 
 FHLB Securities. We hold Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLB advance program. There is no market for the common stock. 
 The aggregate fair value of our FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock as of September 30, 2024 was 18.6 million based on its par value. No unrealized gains or losses have been recorded because we have determined that the par value of the common stock represents its fair value. We owned shares of FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock at September 30, 2024 with a par value that was equal to what we were required to own to maintain our membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to obtain advances. We are required to purchase additional stock as our outstanding advances increase. Any excess stock we own is redeemed weekly by the FHLB-Pittsburgh. 
 Evaluation of Securities Portfolio. The Bank measures expected credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities when the Bank does not intend to sell, or when it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For available-for-sale debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Bank evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. 
 The Bank measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities on a collective basis by security investment grade. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.

Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The composition and maturities of the investment securities portfolio not carried at fair value at September 30, 2024 are summarized in the following table.

Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits, borrowings, repayments and prepayments of loans and securities, proceeds from maturing securities and cash flows from operations are the primary sources of our funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes. 
 Deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of savings accounts, interest bearing demand accounts, checking accounts, money market accounts, club accounts, certificates of deposit and IRAs and other qualified plan accounts. We provide commercial checking accounts for businesses. 
 At September 30, 2024, our deposits totaled 1.6 billion. Interest-bearing demand, savings and club, and money market deposits totaled 790.4 million at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had a total of 582.1 million in certificates of deposit. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits totaled 256.6 million. 
 Our deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas in which our branch offices are located. We rely on our favorable locations, customer service and competitive pricing to attract and retain these deposits. While we accept certificates of deposit in excess of 100,000 for which we may provide preferential rates, we generally do not solicit such deposits as they are more difficult to retain than core deposits. At September 30, 2024, we had brokered certificates of deposits totaling 252.0 million.

 Borrowings 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow approximately 890.7 million under our credit facilities with the FHLB-Pittsburgh. 
 Competition 
 We face significant competition in both originating loans and attracting deposits. The counties in which we operate have a significant concentration of financial institutions, many of which are significantly larger institutions and have greater financial resources, and many of which are our competitors to varying degrees. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, leasing companies, insurance companies and other financial service companies. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from nondepository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies. 
 We seek to meet this competition by the convenience of our branch locations, emphasizing personalized banking, electronic banking solutions and the advantage of local decision-making in our banking business. Specifically, we promote and maintain relationships and build customer loyalty within local communities by focusing our marketing and community involvement on the specific needs of individual neighborhoods. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had the largest deposit market share in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. We do not rely on any individual, group, or entity for a material portion of our deposits. 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 236 full-time employees, and 17 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 
 We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. Continual learning and career development is advanced through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees, internally developed training programs, customized corporate training engagements and educational reimbursement programs. Reimbursement is available to employees enrolled in pre-approved degree or certification programs at accredited institutions that teach skills or knowledge relevant to our business, in compliance with Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code, and for seminars, conferences, and other training events employees attend in connection with their job duties. 
 Employee retention helps us operate efficiently and achieve one of our business objectives, which is being a low-cost provider. We believe our commitment to living out our core values, actively prioritizing concern for our employees well-being, supporting our employees career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits aids in retention of our top-performing employees. In addition, nearly all of our employees are stockholders of the Company through participation in our employee stock ownership plan, which aligns associate and stockholder interests by providing stock ownership on a tax-deferred basis at no investment cost to our associates.

 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 General 
 The Company is a Pennsylvania corporation. As a bank holding company, we are required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. 
 The Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF ). We are subject to extensive regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the Department ), our chartering agency, and by the FDIC, our primary federal regulator. We must file reports with the Department and the FDIC concerning our activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other savings institutions. There are periodic examinations by the Department and the FDIC to test our compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and with their examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department or the FDIC could have a material adverse impact on us and our operations. 
 Regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities 
 The Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (the Banking Code ), contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers, employees, and depositors, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Department so that the supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices. The Department may also take enforcement actions against savings banks and may appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank under certain circumstances. 
 The Department generally examines each savings bank not less frequently than once every two years. Although the Department may accept the examinations and reports of the FDIC in lieu of the Department s examination, the current practice is for the Department to conduct individual examinations. The Department may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any trustee, officer, attorney, or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Department has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Department why such person should not be removed. 
 Regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
 The Bank is also subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the FDIC as its primary federal regulator. Such regulation and supervision: 
 limits the activities and investment authority of the Bank; 

establishes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with the Bank s safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods; 

establishes various capital categories resulting in various levels of regulatory scrutiny applied to the institutions in a particular category; and 

establishes standards for safety and soundness. 

16 

The FDIC is required by law to examine each regulated institution every twelve months, subject to an exception for institutions of less than 3 billion of total assets that satisfy certain other criteria, which are on an eighteen-month examination schedule. The FDIC has the authority to order any savings bank and its directors, officers, attorneys or employees to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound banking practice. 
 Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities as principal and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC. 
 Before engaging in a new activity as principal that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured savings bank must seek approval from the FDIC to engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the savings bank meets its minimum capital requirements, and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the DIF. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions. Although the Bank meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries, it has not chosen to engage in such activities. 
 Transactions with Affiliates 
 Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and implementing regulations. An affiliate of a bank includes, but is not limited to, any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the bank. Generally, a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or financial subsidiary is not treated as an affiliate of the bank under Sections 23A and 23B, but instead is considered part of the bank for purposes of the applicable limits and requirements. 
 Section 23A: 
 limits the extent to which a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 of such bank s capital stock and surplus, and limits all covered transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 of such bank s capital stock and surplus; and 

requires that all covered transactions be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 

The term covered transaction includes extensions of credit, purchase of securities and assets, issuance of guarantees, and other types transactions defined by statute and regulation. Most loans by a bank to its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 of the loan amounts, depending on the type of collateral. 
 In addition, under Section 23B, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate, and certain other specified transactions, including the purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate, must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving a non-affiliate. 
 Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
 Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC s DIF generally up to a maximum of 250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category. 
 The FDIC charges insured depository institutions risk-based assessments to maintain the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. Assessments for most banks are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure over three years. . As of January 1, 2024, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) for institutions of the Bank s size is 2.5 basis points to 32 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. 
 
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, except that no adjustment can be made without notice and comment rulemaking. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment. 
 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or 
 17 

condition imposed by the FDIC. The Bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance. 
 Capital Requirements 
 Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio, and a Tier 1 capital to total adjusted assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , 6 and 8 , respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4 Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI ), up to 45 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The Bank elected to opt out of this requirement. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0 is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50 is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100 is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150 is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0 to 600 is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. A bank s failure to achieve the capital conservation buffer will result in restrictions on paying dividends, engaging in stock repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. 
 Institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion that meet certain other requirements (including off-balance sheet exposure of 25 or less of total assets and trading assets and liabilities of 5 or less of total assets) may elect to use the optional community bank leverage ratio framework, which requires maintaining a leverage ratio of greater than 8.5 for calendar year 2021 and 9 thereafter. Eligible institutions with a capital level meeting or exceeding the specified requirement and electing to use the community bank leverage ratio framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two-quarter grace period to either comply with the community bank leverage ratio requirements or comply with the general capital regulations, including the risk-based capital requirements. The Bank did not opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework as of September 30, 2024. 
 In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Bank s capital exceeded all applicable requirements. 
 Any state-chartered savings bank that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions by the FDIC. Such actions could include a capital directive, a cease-and-desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of 
 18 

restrictions on an institution s operations, termination of federal deposit insurance and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. Certain corrective actions are required by law, as described further under Prompt Corrective Action. 
 We are also subject to capital regulations of the Department which generally incorporate federal leverage and risk-based capital requirements. 
 Dividends from ESSA Bank Trust 
 Our ability to pay dividends depends, to a large extent, upon the Bank s ability to pay dividends to the Company. The Banking Code states that no dividend may be paid out of surplus without approval of the Department. Dividends may be paid out of accumulated net earnings. No dividend may generally be paid that would result in the Bank failing to comply with its regulatory capital requirements. 
 Prompt Corrective Action 
 Under the federal Prompt Corrective Action regulations, a savings bank is deemed to be (i) well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or more, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5.0 or more, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or more, and is not subject to any to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued under certain statutes and regulations, to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or more, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4.0 or more, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 or more, and does not meet the definition of well capitalized (iii) undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less than 4.0 , or a common equity Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.5 ; (iv) significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0 , a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less than 3.0 , or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3 ; and (v) critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . Federal regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well-capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). 
 Generally, the FDIC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator within specific time frames for a savings bank that becomes critically undercapitalized. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a savings bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. The holding company for a savings bank required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of: an amount equal to 5 of a savings bank s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings bank to adequately capitalized status. The guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the savings bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain mandatory restrictions, including on capital distributions and growth. Significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional restrictions. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against an undercapitalized savings bank, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 
 The Prompt Corrective Action categories discussed above were effective January 1, 2015 and reflect the revised regulatory capital requirements effective the same date. The final rule establishing the community bank leverage ratio provides that an institution electing and complying with that alternative regulatory capital framework is considered to be well capitalized under the Prompt Corrective Actions regulations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was a well-capitalized institution under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations. 
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the CRA ), every insured depository institution, including the Bank, has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the FDIC to assess the depository institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and consider that record in its consideration of certain applications by the institution, such as for a merger or the 
 19 

establishment of a branch office. The FDIC may use an unsatisfactory CRA examination rating as the basis for denying such an application. The Bank received a Needs to Improve CRA rating from the FDIC in its most recent CRA evaluation. 
 On October 24, 2024, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a final rule to strengthen and modernize the CRA regulations. Under the final rule, banks with assets of at least 600 million as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years and less than 2 billion as of December 31 in either of the prior two calendar years will be an intermediate bank, and banks with assets of at least 2 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years will be a large bank. The agencies will evaluate large banks under four performance tests: the Retail Lending Test, the Retail Services and Products Test, the Community Development Financing Test, and the Community Development Services Test. The agencies will evaluate intermediate banks under the Retail Lending Test and either the current community development test, referred to in the final rule as the Intermediate Bank Community Development Test, or, at the bank s option, the Community Development Financing Test. The applicability date for the majority of the provisions in the CRA regulations is January 1, 2026, and additional requirements will be applicable on January 1, 2027. 
 The Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act 
 The Bank Secrecy Act BSA and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 USA PATRIOT Act require the Bank to implement a compliance program to detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and illicit crime. Together, the BSA and USA PATRIOT Act require the Bank to implement internal controls, conduct customer due diligence, maintain records, and file reports. The USA PATRIOT Act also required the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition, our controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with the BSA, USA PATRIOT Act, and regulations implemented thereunder. 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 The Company is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company and is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Bank Holding Company Act ), as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy regulations for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary institutions apply to bank holding companies with 3 billion or more in consolidated assets. Bank holding companies with under 3 billion of consolidated assets, including the Company, are not subject to the consolidated requirements unless otherwise directed by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy and required the issuance of implementing regulations. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank must guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of an undercapitalized bank. If an undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution. In addition, Federal Reserve Board policy is that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income for the past year is consistent with the Company s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 
 A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will equal 10 or more of the Company s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that is well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, has received at least an overall satisfactory composite rating, as well as satisfactory rating for management, at its most recent bank holding company examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. In addition, Federal Reserve Board guidance provides for agency prior review of bank holding company dividends and stock redemptions and repurchases in certain circumstances, which may affect our ability to pay dividends, or engage in redemptions or repurchases. 
 As a financial holding company, we are permitted (1) to engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity, and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or (2) to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. We may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control 
 20 

of more than 5 of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 
 In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, we must remain well capitalized and well managed under applicable regulations and maintain a satisfactory or better rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. Failure to meet one or more of the requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that we could not undertake new activities, make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies, or continue certain activities. 
 Regulatory Enforcement Authority 
 Federal law provides federal banking regulators with substantial enforcement powers over regulated depository institutions and their institution-affiliated parties IAPs ). This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties and issue cease-and-desist orders, and to prohibit or remove IAPs from their positions. In general, these enforcement actions may be premised on violations of laws and regulations, unsafe or unsound practices, or non-compliance with agency conditions or agreements. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. 
 Federal Securities Laws 
 Shares of the Company s common stock are registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The Company is also subject to the proxy rules, tender offer rules, insider trading restrictions, annual and periodic reporting, and other requirements of the Exchange Act. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Company has policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with this Act and its implementing regulations. 

FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION 
 Federal Taxation 
 
 General. ESSA Bancorp and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to ESSA Bancorp and the Bank. 
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, ESSA Bancorp currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending September 30 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995. 
 Bad Debt Reserves. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts for tax purposes and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at the Bank s taxable income. As a result of the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, the Bank must use the specific charge off method in computing its bad debt deduction for tax purposes. 
 Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definition tests. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated these thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 reserves remain subject to tax recapture should the Bank make certain distributions from its tax bad debt reserve or cease to maintain a financial institution charter. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s total federal pre-1988 reserve was approximately 4.6 million. This reserve reflects the cumulative effects of federal tax deductions by the Bank for which no federal income tax provision has been made. 
 21 

Minimum Tax. The alternative minimum tax for corporations has been repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Any unused minimum tax credit of a corporation may be used to offset regular tax liability for any tax year. In addition, a portion of unused minimum tax credit was refundable in 2018 through 2021. The refundable portion is 100 for the tax years beginning after December 31, 2018 of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the year over any credit allowable against regular tax for that year. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had no minimum tax credit carryforward. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Effective with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, net operating loss carrybacks are no longer permitted, and net operating losses are allowed to be carried forward indefinitely. Net operating loss carryforwards arising from tax years beginning after January 1, 2019 are limited to offset a maximum of 80 of a future year s taxable income. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had no net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes. 
 Corporate Dividends. We may exclude from our income 100 of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
 Audit of Tax Returns. ESSA Bancorp s federal income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent three-year period. The 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 tax years remain open. The tax returns filed for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023 represents tax years 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. The Company has not yet filed its tax return for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 which represents the 2023 tax year. 
 State Taxation 
 ESSA Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax. The Corporation Net Income Tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is 9.99 and is imposed on unconsolidated taxable income for federal purposes with certain adjustments. The Bank is subject to tax under the Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax Act, as amended to include thrift institutions having capital stock. Pursuant to the Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax, the tax rate is 11.5 . The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax exempts the Bank from other taxes imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for state income tax purposes and from all local taxation imposed by political subdivisions, except taxes on real estate and real estate transfers. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax is a tax upon net earnings or income received or accrued from all sources during the year, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with certain adjustments. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax, in computing income according to generally accepted accounting principles, allows for the deduction of interest earned on state and federal obligations, while disallowing a percentage of thrift s interest expense deduction in the proportion of interest income on those securities to the overall interest income of the Bank. Net operating losses, if any, thereafter, can be carried forward three years for Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax purposes.

Item 1A. R isk Factors 
 In addition to factors discussed in the description of our business and elsewhere in this report, the following are factors that could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. 
 Economic and Market Area 
 Changes in economic conditions, in particular an economic slowdown in the markets we operate in, could materially and negatively affect our business. 
 Our business is directly impacted by factors such as economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. Any deterioration in economic conditions, whether caused by national or local concerns, in particular any further economic slowdown in the markets we operate in, could result in the following consequences, any of which could hurt our business materially: loan delinquencies may increase; problem assets and foreclosures may increase; demand for our products and services may decrease; low cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease; and collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans. 
 Our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits, and housing starts in our markets. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may not succeed. An economic downturn or prolonged recession may result in the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of deposits, which in turn would hurt its business. If we experience an economic downturn or a prolonged economic recession occurs in the economy as a whole, borrowers will be less likely to repay their loans as scheduled. Unlike many larger institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. An economic downturn could, therefore, result in losses that materially and adversely affect our business. 
 Inflationary pressures and rising prices may affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Inflation rose sharply at the end of 2021 and remained at an elevated level through 2023 and early 2024. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not able to leverage economics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other costs to the Company to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Concentration of Loans in Our Primary Market Area May Increase the Risk of Increased Nonperforming Assets. 
 Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the Pennsylvania counties of Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery as nearly all of our loans are to customers in these markets. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in these market areas have a significant impact on the ability of borrowers to repay loans as well as our ability to originate new loans. As such, decline in real estate values in these market areas would also lower the value of the collateral securing loans on properties in these market areas. In addition, weakening in general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could negatively affect our financial results. 
 Strong Competition Within Our Market Areas May Limit Our Growth and Profitability. 
 Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market areas, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas. For additional information see Item 1. Business Competition. 
 The Soundness of Other Financial Services Institutions May Adversely Affect Our Credit Risk. 
 We rely on other financial services institutions through trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We maintain limits and monitor concentration levels of our counterparties as specified in our internal policies. Our reliance on other 
 23 

financial services institutions exposes us to credit risk in the event of default by these institutions or counterparties. These losses could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Interest Rate and Asset Quality 
 Future Changes in Interest Rates Could Reduce Our Profits. 
 Our ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between: 
 1. the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and 

2. the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. 

The rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of times. Like many banks, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility, as market interest rates change over time. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest paid on our liabilities, as borrowers speed up prepayments of mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called, requiring us to reinvest those cash flows at lower interest rates. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our ability to originate loans and/or the ability of our borrowers to make loan repayments on adjustable-rate loans, as the interest owed on such loans would increase as interest rates increase. 
 In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A reduction in interest rates may result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans in order to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Alternatively, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. 
 Changes in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of our investment securities available for sale totaled 215.9 million. Unrealized net losses on these available for sale securities totaled approximately 10.6 million at September 30, 2024 and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale in future periods would have an adverse effect on stockholders equity. 
 We evaluate interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in the Bank s Economic Value of Equity EVE over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is the net present value of the Company s asset cash flows minus the net present value of the Company s liability cash flows. At September 30, 2024, in the event of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company s model projects that we would experience a 2.4 million, or 4.0 , decrease in net portfolio value. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management of Market Risk. 
 A significant portion of our assets consists of investment securities, which generally have lower yields than loans, and we classify a significant portion of our investment securities as available for sale, which creates potential volatility in our equity and may have an adverse impact on our net income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our securities portfolio totaled 263.2 million, or 12.0 of our total assets. Investment securities typically have lower yields than loans. However, for the year ended September 30, 2024, the weighted average yield of our investment securities portfolio was 5.13 , as compared to 5.10 for our loan portfolio. 
 At September 30, 2024, 215.9 million, or 82.0 of our investment securities, were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income, which affects our reported equity. Accordingly, given the significant size of the investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale and due to possible mark-to-market adjustments of that portion of the portfolio resulting from market conditions, we may experience greater volatility in the value of reported equity. Moreover, given that we actively manage our investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale, we may sell securities which could result in a realized loss, thereby reducing our net income. 
 Our Continued Emphasis on Commercial Real Estate Lending Increases Our Exposure to Increased Lending Risks. 
 Our business strategy centers on continuing our emphasis on commercial real estate lending. We have grown our loan portfolio in recent years with respect to this type of loan and intend to continue to emphasize this type of lending. At September 30, 2024, 884.6 million, or 50.3 , of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans 
 24 

because repayment of the commercial real estate loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the underlying property. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified on the basis of the property s collateral value, net income and debt service ratio; however, there is no assurance that our underwriting policies will protect us from credit-related losses. 
 Increases to the Allowance for Credit Losses May Cause Our Earnings to Decrease. 
 Our customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. In addition, the estimates used to determine the fair value of such loans as of the acquisition date may be inconsistent with the actual performance of the acquired loans. Hence, we may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we rely on loan quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income. 
 Our emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating our allowance for credit losses. As we continue to increase the amount of these loans, additional or increased provisions for credit losses may be necessary and as a result would decrease our earnings. 
 
 Source of Funds 
 Our funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our future growth. 
 A lack of liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and result in regulatory limits being placed on the Company. 
 We must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also receive funds from loan repayments, investment maturities and income on other interest-earning assets. While we emphasize the generation of low-cost core deposits as a source of funding, there is strong competition for such deposits in our market area. Additionally, deposit balances can decrease if customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. Accordingly, as a part of our liquidity management, we must use a number of funding sources in addition to deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. As we continue to grow, we may become more dependent on these sources, which could include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, federal funds purchased and brokered certificates of deposit. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability to access these additional funding sources. 
 Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, pay our expenses, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A lack of liquidity could also attract increased regulatory scrutiny and potential restraints imposed on us by regulators. Depending on the capitalization status and regulatory treatment of depository institutions, including whether an institution is subject to a supervisory prompt corrective action directive, certain additional regulatory restrictions and prohibitions may apply, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. 
 Our reliance on wholesale funding could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. 
 Among other sources of funds, we rely on wholesale funding, including short- and long-term borrowings, brokered deposits and non-brokered deposits acquired through listing services, to provide funds with which to make loans, purchase investment securities and provide for other liquidity needs. On September 30, 2024, wholesale funding totaled 567.8 million, or approximately 26.0 of total assets. 
 In the future, this funding may not be readily replaced as it matures, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to maintain it. Not being able to maintain or replace those funds as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Paying higher interest rates to maintain or replace funding would adversely affect our net interest margin and operating results. 
 25 

Regulatory Matters 
 We Operate in a Highly Regulated Environment and May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Laws and Regulations. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Department. Such regulators govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank, the imposition of higher capital requirements, and the adequacy of a bank s allowance for credit losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on us and our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and applicable regulations are subject to regular modification and change. There can be no assurance that proposed laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws, rules or regulations, will not be adopted in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects. 
 Security 
 Risks Associated with System Failures, Interruptions, Or Breaches of Security Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings. 
 Information technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches (including privacy breaches), but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security. 
 In addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. 
 The occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Associated with Cyber-Security Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings. 
 The financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber-attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions. 
 We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches. 
 We also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third-party processors, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption. 
 Our customers are also the target of cyber-attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses. 
 The occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 While our Board of Directors takes an active role in cybersecurity risk tolerance, we rely to a large degree on management and outside consultants in overseeing cybersecurity risk management. 
 26 

Our Board of Directors takes an active role in the cybersecurity risk tolerance of the Company and all members receive cybersecurity training annually. The Board reviews the annual risk assessments and approves information technology policies, which include cybersecurity. Furthermore, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing all audit findings related to information technology general controls, internal and external vulnerability, and penetration testing. We also engage outside consultants to support our cybersecurity efforts. However, our directors do not have significant experience in cybersecurity risk management outside of the Company and therefore, its ability to fulfill its oversight function remains dependent on the input it receives from management and outside consultants. 
 Item 1B. Unresolv ed Staff Comments 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 1C. Cybe rsecurity 
 Incident Response Plan 
 The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the risks from cybersecurity threats. 
 ESSA Bank and Trust has adopted an Incident Response Plan (the IR PPlan for responding to cybersecurity incidents. This IR Plan applies to both potential and actual incidents. The IR Plan should be invoked in any context where the Bank believes that an incident may have occurred. The IR Plan applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties. The objectives of the IR Plan are to ensure the protection of customer data and all organization assets from security incidents and ensure timely detection, mitigation, and communication of security incidents to appropriate parties. 
 Implementation of the IR Plan requires cross-functional efforts from across the organization. The roles/functions involved and the related responsibilities in enforcing the IR Plan are spread across the entire organization of the Bank s senior. 
 Once the possibility of a cybersecurity incident has been noted, employees assigned to appropriate teams do the necessary research and analysis to confirm either that there is an incident requiring additional action, or that no further action is necessary. This will typically involve some combination of Operations and Information Technology. If an incident is confirmed, an incident response team is formed, and the team takes steps to contain the incident to limit damage, eradicate the incident to restore our full control of all Bank systems and eliminate unauthorized access, and recover data and full functionality. Detection and analysis continue during this phase as necessary to ensure that this phase has been successfully executed. This phase also involves communication as needed with employees, customers, partners and service providers, legal representatives, insurance provider, law-enforcement authorities, and regulatory bodies as necessary and appropriate. 
 In the post-incident phase, the Bank analyzes the root cause of the incident, identifies any changes that need to be made to policies, procedures, training, documentation, and technology to protect against similar incidents in the future, and institutes a plan to implement them. In addition, the Bank undertakes any additional communication with the necessary parties and the public, if appropriate, and the Bank s legal representatives, insurance provider, law-enforcement authorities, and regulatory bodies as appropriate to fully address the impact of the incident, and fully documents the entire incident. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have not materially affected the Company, its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. 

Item 2. Pr operties 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank conducted our business through 21 full-service branch offices located in Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania. We own 13 properties and lease 12 properties inclusive of the 21 full service-branch offices referred to above. On October 1, 2024 the Haverford office, located in Delaware County, was closed. 
 
 The net book value of our premises, land and equipment was 11.3 million at September 30, 2024.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of Management, the resolution of these legal actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. The Company and its subsidiary, ESSA Bank and Trust ESSA B T were named as defendants, among others, in an action commenced on December 8, 2016 by one plaintiff who sought to pursue the suit as a class action on behalf of the entire class of people similarly situated. The plaintiff alleged that a subsidiary of a bank previously acquired by the Company received unearned fees and kickbacks in the process of making loans, in violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. In an order dated January 29, 2018, the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the case. The plaintiff appealed the court s ruling. In an opinion and order dated April 26, 2019, the appellate court reversed the district court s order dismissing the plaintiff s case against the Company and remanded the case to the district court in order to continue the litigation. The litigation is now proceeding before the district court. On December 9, 2019, the court permitted an amendment to the complaint to add two new plaintiffs to the case asserting similar claims. On May 21, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification. Fact and expert discovery were completed, and the Company and ESSA B T filed motions seeking to have the case dismissed (in whole or in part) and/or the class de-certified, as well as for other relief. Plaintiffs opposed the motions. On August 18, 2023 the Court granted the motions to dismiss as to the Company and ESSA B T, with the result that the only remaining defendant is a now-dissolved former wholly-owned subsidiary of a previously-acquired company. The Court also amended its class certification order, and severed one of the original plaintiffs claims from those of the class, ordering a separate trial for that plaintiff. Plaintiffs sought permission to appeal from these and other related rulings but the court denied their request. Plaintiffs have filed a motion seeking relief from some of the court s prior orders. The Company and ESSA B T will continue to vigorously defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Company and/or ESSA B T, the amount or range of such exposure is not currently estimable but could be substantial 
 On May 29, 2020, the Company and ESSA B T were named as defendants in a second action commenced by three plaintiffs who also sought to pursue the action as a class action on behalf of the entire class of people similarly situated. The plaintiffs allege that a subsidiary of a bank previously acquired by the Company received unearned fees and kickbacks from a different title company than the one involved in the previously discussed litigation in the process of making loans. The original complaint alleged violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Sherman Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO ). The plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on September 30, 2020 that dropped the RICO claim, but they are continuing to pursue the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Sherman Act claims. The defendants moved to dismiss the Sherman Act claim on October 14, 2020, and that motion was denied on April 2, 2021. On March 13, 2023 the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. The case is currently in the discovery phase. The Company and ESSA B T intend to vigorously defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Company and/or ESSA B T, the amount or range of such exposure is not currently estimable but could be substantial.

PART II 

Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Sto ckholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 The Company s shares of common stock are traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ESSA. The approximate number of holders of record of ESSA Bancorp s common stock as of September 30, 2024 was 1,622. Certain shares of ESSA Bancorp are held in nominee or street name and accordingly, the number of beneficial owners of such shares is not known or included in the foregoing number. 
 
 The Board of Directors has the authority to declare cash dividends on shares of common stock, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements. In determining whether and in what amount to pay a cash dividend in the future, the Board takes into account a number of factors, including capital requirements, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations, tax considerations, statutory and regulatory limitations and general economic conditions. No assurances can be given that cash dividends will not be reduced or eliminated in the future. 
 The sources of funds for the payment of a cash dividend are interest and principal payments with respect to ESSA Bancorp loan to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, and dividends from the Bank. For a discussion of the limitations applicable to the Bank s ability to pay dividends, see Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation. 
 
 On May 25, 2022 the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a tenth stock repurchase program for up to 500,000 shares of its common stock. The Company has purchased 303,609 shares pursuant to this plan during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 86,242 shares remain to be purchased under the agreement. The Company may repurchase the shares from time to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated stock transactions or in any other manner that is compliant with applicable securities law. The plan has no expiration date. 
 Item 6. [Reserved] 
 
 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to grow and improve our profitability by: 
 Increasing customer relationships through the offering of excellent service and the distribution of that service through effective delivery systems; 

Continuing to transform into a full service community bank by meeting the financial services needs of our customers; 

Continuing to develop into a high performing financial institution, in part by increasing net interest and fee income and managing operating expenses efficiently; 

Remaining within our risk management parameters; and 

Employing affordable technology to increase profitability and improve customer service. 

We intend to continue to pursue our business strategy, subject to changes necessitated by future market conditions and other factors. We also intend to continue focusing on the following: 
 Increasing customer relationships through a continued commitment to service and enhancing products and delivery systems. We will continue to increase customer relationships by focusing on customer satisfaction with regard to service, products, systems and operations. We have upgraded and expanded certain of our facilities, including our corporate center and added additional facilities to provide additional capacity to manage future growth and expand our delivery systems. 

Continuing to develop into a high performing financial institution. We will continue to enhance profitability by focusing on increasing non-interest income as well as increasing commercial products, including commercial real estate lending, which often have a higher profit margin than more traditional products. We also will pursue lower-cost commercial deposits as part of this strategy. 

Remaining within our risk management parameters. We place significant emphasis on risk management and compliance training for all of our directors, officers and employees. We focus on establishing regulatory compliance programs to determine the degree of such compliance and to maintain the trust of our customers and community. 

29 

Employing cost-effective technology to increase profitability and improve customer service. We will continue to upgrade our technology in an efficient manner. We have implemented new software for marketing purposes and have upgraded both our internal and external communication systems. 

Continuing our emphasis on commercial real estate lending to improve our overall performance. We intend to continue to emphasize the origination of higher interest rate margin commercial real estate loans as market conditions, regulations and other factors permit. We have expanded our commercial banking capabilities by adding experienced commercial bankers, and enhancing our direct marketing efforts to local businesses. 

Expanding our banking franchise through branching and acquisitions. We will attempt to use our stock holding company structure to expand our market footprint through de novo branching as well as through additional acquisitions of banks, savings institutions and other financial service providers in our primary market area. We will also consider establishing de novo branches or acquiring additional financial institutions in contiguous counties. We will continue to review and assess locations for new branches both within Monroe County and the counties around Monroe. There can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any new acquisitions or establish any additional new branches. We may continue to explore acquisition opportunities involving other banks and thrifts, and possibly financial service companies, when and as they arise, as a means of supplementing internal growth, filling gaps in our current geographic market area and expanding our customer base, product lines and internal capabilities, although we have no current plans, arrangements or understandings to make any acquisitions. 

Maintaining the quality of our loan portfolio. Maintaining the quality of our loan portfolio is a key factor in managing our growth. We will continue to use customary risk management techniques, such as independent internal and external loan reviews, risk-focused portfolio credit analysis and field inspections of collateral in overseeing the performance of our loan portfolio. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 We consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income, to be critical accounting policies. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies: 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. The following discussion is regarding the critical accounting estimates related to the application of current expected credit losses ("CECL"), which was adopted on October 1, 2023. 
 The allowance for credit losses (ACL) represents an amount which, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb expected credit losses on outstanding loans at the balance sheet date based on the evaluation of the size and current risk characteristics to the loan portfolio, past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and prepayment experience. The ACL is measured on a collective (pooled) basis for loan segments that share similar risk characteristics, including collateral type, credit ratings/scores, size, duration, interest rate structure, origination vintage and payment structure. The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow method for calculating the ACL. Qualitative adjustments are made for differences in loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, acquisition status, current levels of delinquencies, net charge-offs and risk ratings, as well as actual and forecasted macroeconomic variables. Macroeconomic data includes unemployment rates, changes in collateral values such as home prices and commercial real estate prices, gross domestic product and other relevant factors. Management utilizes judgment in determining and applying the qualitative factors and weighting the economic scenarios used, which include baseline, upside and downside forecasts. The ACL is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries of previous losses, and is increased or decreased by a provision for credit losses, which is recorded as a current period operating expense. Specific credit loss allowances are established for identified losses based on a review of such information. A loan evaluated for credit loss is considered to be have a credit loss when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans identified as having a credit loss are evaluated independently. We do not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes 
 Determination of an appropriate ACL is inherently complex and requires the use of significant and highly subjective estimates. The reasonableness of the ACL is reviewed quarterly by management. Management believes it uses relevant information available to make determinations about the ACL and that it has established the existing allowance in accordance with GAAP. However, the determination of the ACL requires significant judgment, and estimates of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio can vary from the amounts actually observed. While management uses available information to recognize expected credit losses, future additions to the ACL may be necessary based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio, changes in the current and forecasted economic conditions, changes in the interest rate environment which may directly impact prepayment and curtailment rate assumption, and changes in the financial condition of the borrowers.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but it is tested at least annually for impairment in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. If the estimated current fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no additional testing is required and an impairment loss is not recorded. The Company uses market capitalization and multiples of tangible book value methods to determine the estimated current fair value of its reporting unit. Based on this analysis, no impairment was recorded in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023. 
 The other intangibles assets are assigned useful lives, which are amortized on an accelerated basis over their weighted-average lives. The Company periodically reviews the intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. Based on these reviews, no impairment was recorded in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023. 
 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Total Assets . Total assets decreased 105.5 million, or 4.6 , to 2.2 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 2.3 billion at September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in investments securities available for sale and total cash and cash equivalents partially offset by growth in total net loans outstanding. 
 Cash and Due from Banks. Cash and due from banks decreased 325,000, or 0.8 , to 38.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 39.0 million at September 30, 2023. 
 Interest-Bearing Deposits with Other Institutions. Interest-bearing deposits with other institutions decreased 36.5 million, or 78.7 , to 9.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 46.4 million at September 30, 2023. 
 Investment Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity. Investment securities available for sale decreased 118.2 million, or 35.4 , to 215.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 334.1 million at September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to decreases in US government treasury securities of 123.6 million and US government agency securities of 22.7 million The Company purchased 125.0 million of US government treasury securities and 25.0 million of US government agency securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that matured during fiscal year 2024. Held to maturity securities decreased 4.9 million to 47.4 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Net Loans. Net loans increased 63.8 million, or 3.8 , to 1.7 billion at September 30, 2024 from September 30, 2023. The primary reasons for the increase were increases in residential real estate loans, obligations of states and political subdivisions, commercial real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, offset in part by decreases in construction loans, commercial loans, other loans and auto loans. Commercial real estate loans increased by 62.7 million to 884.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 822.0 million at September 30, 2023. Commercial loans decreased 11.3 million to 36.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 48.1 million at September 30, 2023. Obligations of states and political subdivisions increased by 452,000 to 48.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 48.1 million at September 30, 2023. One- to four-family loans increased by 8.2 million to 721.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 713.3 million at September 30, 2023. Home equity loans and lines of credit increased by 3.1 million to 51.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 48.2 million at September 30, 2023. Auto loans decreased 458,000 to 65,000 at September 30, 2024 from 523,000 at September 30, 2023. The Company discontinued indirect auto lending in July 2018. 
 Deposits. Deposits decreased by 32.0 million, or 1.9 , to 1.6 billion at September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of decreases in interest bearing demand accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts and non-interest bearing demand accounts partially offset by an increase in certificates of deposit. Noninterest bearing demand accounts were 256.6 million, down 8.5 from September 30, 2023. Interest bearing demand accounts decreased to 312.7 million from September 30, 2023. Money market accounts were 334.6 million at September 30, 2024, down 8.8 from September 30, 2023. Certificates of deposit increased to 582.1 million from 504.1 million at September 30, 2023. 
 Borrowed Funds. Borrowed funds, short term and other, decreased to 290.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 374.7 million at September 30, 2023. FHLB borrowings were 290.0 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Stockholders Equity. Stockholders equity increased by 10.7 million, or 4.9 , to 230.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 219.7 million at September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to net income of 17.0 million and other comprehensive income of 2.9 million partially offset by treasury shares purchased of 5.1 million and cash dividends paid of 5.9 million. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Net Income. Net income decreased by 1.6 million, or 8.5 , to 17.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 from 18.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in noninterest 
 31 

expense and a decrease in net interest income partially offset by decreases in the provision for credit losses and income taxes and an increase in noninterest income. 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased by 3.3 million, or 5.3 , to 58.3 million for fiscal year 2024 from 61.5 million for fiscal year 2023, primarily due to an increase in total interest expense from deposits and short-term borrowings partially offset by increases in interest income. 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 18.0 million, or 21.0 , to 103.5 million for fiscal year 2024 from 85.5 million for fiscal year 2023. The increase resulted from an increase of 47 basis points in the overall yield on interest earning assets to 4.98 from 4.51 , which had the effect of increasing interest income by 9.2 million along with an increase of 181.0 million in average interest earning assets, which had the effect of increasing interest income by 8.7 million. The increase in average interest earning assets during 2024 compared to 2023 included increases in average loans receivable of 144.0 million. Average mortgage backed securities increased 8.6 million, average FHLB stock increased 1.7 million and average investment securities increased 2.9 million. The average yield on loans increased to 5.10 for the fiscal year 2024, from 4.65 for the fiscal year 2023. The average yields on investment securities increased to 5.13 for fiscal year 2024 from 4.50 for fiscal year 2023 and the average yields on mortgage backed securities increased to 3.24 for fiscal 2024 from 2.79 for the fiscal 2023 period. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 21.2 million, or 88.7 , to 45.2 million for fiscal year 2024 from 23.9 million for fiscal year 2023. The increase in interest expense resulted from a 109 basis point increase in the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities to 2.70 for fiscal 2024 from 1.61 for fiscal 2023 which had the effect of increasing interest expense by 12.6 million along with an increase in average interest bearing liabilities which had the effect of increasing interest expense by 8.5 million. For fiscal 2024, average borrowed funds increased 68.3 million compared to fiscal 2023. Average savings and club accounts decreased by 23.7 million, average interest bearing demand deposit accounts decreased 23.3 million, average money market accounts decreased 35.1 million and average certificates of deposit increased 193.6 million. The cost of money market accounts increased to 2.31 for fiscal year 2024 from 1.48 for fiscal year 2024. The cost of interest bearing demand deposit accounts increased to 0.83 for fiscal year 2024 from 0.67 for fiscal year 2024. The cost of savings and club accounts increased to 0.08 for fiscal year 2024 from 0.06 for fiscal 2023. The cost of certificates of deposit increased to 4.52 from 3.07 and the cost of borrowed funds increased to 3.18 from 2.14 for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Provision for Credit Losses. The Company establishes provisions for credit losses, which are charged to earnings, at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements.On October 1, 2023 we implemented ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. This resulted in a decrease to the allowance for credit losses of 2.8 million. The Company made a credit loss release of 1.4 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to a credit loss provision of 700,000 for fiscal year 2023. The Company did not recognize any credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities for the year ended September 30, 2024. For more information about our provision and allowance for credit losses and our loss experience, see Note 4 - Loans Receivable, Net of Allowance For Credit Losses on Loans to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.The allowance for credit losses was 15.3 million, or 0.87 of loans outstanding, at September 30, 2024, compared to 18.5 million, or 1.09 of loans outstanding, at September 30, 2023. 
 Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Management reviews the level of the allowance on a quarterly basis, and establishes the provision for credit losses based on the factors set forth in the preceding paragraph. Historically, the Bank s loan portfolio has consisted primarily of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. However, our current business plan calls for increases in commercial real estate loan originations. As management evaluates the allowance for credit losses, the increased risk associated with larger non-homogenous commercial real estate may result in large additions to the allowance for credit losses in future periods. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the underlying property. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. 
 Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for credit losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary, based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors. In addition, the FDIC, as an integral part of its examination process, will periodically review our allowance for credit losses. This agency may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance, based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination. 
 Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased 298,000, or 3.8 , to 8.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, from 7.9 million for the comparable 2023 period. The increase was primarily due to increases in loss on sale of investments, net of 121,000, earnings on bank owned life insurance of 145,000, gain on sale of loans, net of 203,000 and other noninterest 
 32 

income of 274,000. These increases were offset, in part, by decreases in service fees on deposit accounts of 267,000, insurance commissions of 57,000, service charges and fees on loans of 19,000 and loan swap fees of 100,000. 
 Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased 1.2 million, or 2.6 , to 46.9 million for fiscal year 2024 from 45.7 million for the comparable period in 2023. The primary reasons for the increase in noninterest expense were increases in compensation and employee benefits of 285,000, occupancy and equipment of 501,000, data processing of 489,000, FDIC insurance premiums of 560,000, advertising of 32,000, and other expenses of 18,000. These increases were partially offset by decreases in professional fees of 465,000 and foreclosed real estate of 130,000. 
 Income Taxes. Income tax expense of 4.0 million was recognized for fiscal year 2024 compared to an income tax expense of 4.5 million recognized for fiscal year 2023. The effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2024 was 18.9 compared to 19.5 for the 2023 period.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments for 2024 or 2023.

Management of Market Risk 
 General. The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of loans, having longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has approved guidelines for managing the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the asset/liability committee meets quarterly to review our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position. We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. 
 Net interest income, which is the primary source of the Company s earnings, is impacted by changes in interest rates and the relationship of different interest rates. To manage the impact of the rate changes, the balance sheet should be structured so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities at approximately the same time intervals. The Company uses net interest simulation to assist in interest rate risk management. The process includes simulating various interest rate environments and their impact on net interest income. As of September 30, 2024, the level of net interest income at risk in a 200 basis points increase or a 200 basis point decrease was within the Company s policy limit of a decline less than 10 of net interest income. 
 34 

The following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of September 30, 2024.

The above table indicates that as of September 30, 2024, in the event of a 400 basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates, the Company would experience an 5.4 , or 3.3 million, decrease in net interest income. In the event of a 400 basis point decrease in interest rates, the Company would experience a 0.3 , or 182,000, decrease in net interest income. 
 Another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in the economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks. The following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of September 30, 2024.

The preceding table indicates that as of September 30, 2024, in the event of an immediate and sustained 400 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 23.3 , or 60.4 million, decrease in the present value of equity. If rates were to decrease 400 basis points, the Company would experience a 16.9 , or 43.7 million, decrease in the present value of equity. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity. Moreover, the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet both our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives. 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, and earnings and funds provided from operations, as well as 
 35 

access to FHLB advances and other borrowings. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. 
 A portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, which are a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. At September 30, 2024, 48.6 million of our assets were invested in cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans, proceeds from the maturities of investment securities, principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities, increases in deposit accounts and borrowings. There were 9.3 million in short-term investment securities (maturing in one year or less) at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had 290 million in borrowings outstanding from the FHLB-Pittsburgh. We have access to FHLB advances of up to approximately 890.7 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 418.1 million in loan commitments outstanding, which included 111.6 million in undisbursed construction loans, 57.5 million in unused home equity lines of credit, 75.7 million in commercial lines of credit and 173.3 million in other unused commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled 462.4 million, or 79.4 of certificates of deposit. If these maturing deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before September 30, 2025. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. 
 As reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, our cash flows are classified for financial reporting purposes as operating, investing or financing cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was 15.1 million and 20.9 million for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts differ from our net income because of a variety of cash receipts and disbursements that did not affect net income for the respective periods. Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities was 75.4 million and (377.1) million in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, principally reflecting our loan and investment security activities in the respective periods. Cash proceeds from principal repayments, maturities and sales of investment securities amounted to 171.3 million and 26.2 million in the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Deposit and borrowing cash flows have traditionally comprised most of our financing activities which resulted in net cash (used for) provided by financing activities of (127.3) million in fiscal year 2024, and 413.7 million in fiscal year 2023. 
 We also have obligations under our post retirement plan as described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The post retirement benefit payments represent actuarially determined future payments to eligible plan participants. We froze our pension plan in fiscal year 2017. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For information about our loan commitments, letters of credit and unused lines of credit, see Note 9 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. For information about the Company s derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 16 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 For fiscal year 2024, we did not engage in any off-balance-sheet transactions other than loan origination commitments and standby letters of credit in the normal course of our lending activities. The Company used derivative financial instruments as part of its interest rate hedging activities in 2024. 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 The financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 (c) Management report on internal control over financial reporting. 

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of ESSA Bancorp; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ESSA Bancorp s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 ESSA Bancorp, Inc. s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in 2013, by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework . Based on our assessment we believe that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 
 The Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to exemption rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT ON MANAGEMENT S ASSE SSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL 
 OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 ESSA Bancorp, Inc. (the Company is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements and notes included in this annual report have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include some amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments. 
 We, as management of the Company, are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting that is designed to produce reliable financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The system of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the financial statements is evaluated for effectiveness by management and tested for reliability. Actions are taken to correct potential deficiencies as they are identified. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. 
 Management assessed the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting as described in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this assessment, management concludes that, as of September 30, 2024, its system of internal control over financial reporting is effective and meets the criteria of the Internal Control Integrated Framework .

REPORT OF INDEPEN DENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ESSA Bancorp, Inc. 

Change in Accounting Principle 
 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective October 1, 2023, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses . 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent, with respect to the Company, in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements; and (2) involve our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter, in any way, our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) Qualitative Factors 
 
 Description of the Matter 
 The Company s loan portfolio totaled 1.76 billion as of September 30, 2024, and the associated ACL was 15.3 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, estimating an appropriate allowance for credit losses requires management to make certain assumptions about expected losses on loans in the loan portfolio over their remaining contractual life as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis, at the balance sheet date. The measurement of expected credit losses on collectively evaluated loans is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the amortized cost basis. Management applies qualitative adjustments to reflect the inherent losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date that are not reflected in the historical loss experience. Qualitative adjustments are made based upon changes in economic conditions, portfolio composition, and delinquent and classified trends . 
 
 We identified these qualitative adjustments within the ACL as critical audit matters because they involve a high degree of subjectivity. While the determination of these qualitative adjustments includes analysis of observable data over the historical loss period, the judgments required to assess the directionality and magnitude of adjustments is highly subjective. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature of audit evidence and the nature and extent of effort required to address these matters. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 
 Testing the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the calculation of the allowance for credit losses, including the qualitative factor adjustments. 

Testing the completeness and accuracy of the data inputs used by management as a basis for the qualitative factors by agreeing them to internal and external data sources. 

Testing management s process and evaluating the reasonableness of their inputs and assumptions by evaluating the reasonableness of the qualitative adjustments, including the magnitude and directional consistency of the adjustments. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2005.

days past due or the Company has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans generally is either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to the Company s judgment as to the collectability of principal. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current and has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

days past due. A loan is considered to be a troubled debt restructuring TDR loan when the Company grants a concession to the borrower because of the borrower s financial condition that it would not otherwise consider. Such concessions include the reduction of interest rates, forgiveness of principal or interest, or other modifications of interest rates that are less than the current market rate for new obligations with similar risk. TDR loans that are in compliance with their modified terms and that yield a market rate may be removed from the TDR status after one year of performance.

The stock s value is determined by the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines. The determination of whether the par value will ultimately be recovered is influenced by criteria such as the following: (a) The significance of the decline in net assets of the FHLB as compared to the capital stock amount and the length of time this situation has persisted; (b) commitments by the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance; (c) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on the customer base of the FHLB; and (d) the liquidity position of the FHLB. With consideration given to these factors, management concluded that the stock was not impaired at September 30, 2024.

impairment was recorded in 2024 or 2023. The other intangible assets are assigned useful lives, which are amortized on an accelerated basis over their weighted-average lives. The Company periodically reviews intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. Based on these reviews, impairment was recorded in 2024 and 2023.

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) and Vintage Disclosures . The guidance amends ASC 326 to eliminate the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructuring activities by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Specifically, rather than applying TDR recognition and measurement guidance, creditors will determine whether a modification results in a new loan or continuation of existing loan. These amendments are intended to enhance existing disclosure requirements and introduce new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, the amendments to ASC 326 require that an entity disclose current-period gross writeoffs by year of origination within the vintage disclosures, which requires that an entity disclose the amortized cost basis of financing receivables by credit quality indicator and class of financing receivable by year of origination. The guidance is only for entities that have adopted the amendments in Update 2016-13 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption using prospective application, including adoption in an interim period where the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company this guidance on .

At September 30, 2024, the fair value of available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded was million, including unrealized losses of million. The Corporation does not intend to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position and is unlikely to be required to sell these securities before a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity. The Corporation concluded that the decline in fair value of these securities was not indicative of a credit loss. Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities totaled million at September 30, 2024 and is included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. This amount is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of held-to-maturity securities in an unrealized loss position for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded was million, including unrealized losses of million. The Corporation did not recognize any credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities for the year ended September 30, 2024 or other-than-temporary impairment charges during 2023. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity debt securities totaled at September 30, 2024 and is included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. This amount is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are included under the CECL methodology. Calculation of expected credit loss under CECL is done on a collective pooled basis, with assets grouped when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company notes that at September 30, 2024 all securities in the held-to-maturity classification are U.S. government agency and US government mortgage-backed securities; therefore, they share the same risk characteristics and can be evaluated on a collective basis. The expected credit loss on these securities is evaluated based on historical credit losses of this security type and the expected

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company considered its concentration of credit risk to be acceptable. As of September 30, 2024, the highest concentrations are in lessors of residential buildings and dwellings and the lessors of non-residential buildings and dwellings categories, with loans outstanding of million, or of loans outstanding, to residential lessors, and million, or of loans outstanding, to commercial lessors. There were charge-offs on loans within these concentrations in 2024. For the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized charge offs on commercial lessors and 0 on residential lessors. Loans serviced by the Company for others amounted to million and million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company began selling current production residential real estate loans to the FHLB in February 2020. The Company s primary business activity is with customers located in counties where its branch offices are located and to a lesser extent, the contiguous counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Commercial, residential, and consumer loans are granted. The Company also funds commercial and residential loans originated outside its immediate trade area provided such loans meet the Company s credit policy guidelines. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and 2023, loans outstanding to individuals and businesses are dependent upon the local economic conditions in its immediate trade area.

The Company maintains a loan review system that allows for a periodic review of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential credit deterioration in loans. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers. Specific credit loss allowances are established for identified losses based on a review of such information. A loan is analyzed for credit loss when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans are evaluated independently. The Company does not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes. Credit loss is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent.

The Company uses a dual risk rating methodology to monitor the credit quality of the overall commercial loan portfolio. This rating system consists of a borrower rating scale from and a collateral coverage rating scale from A to J that provides a mechanism to separate borrower creditworthiness from the value of collateral recovery in the event of default. The two ratings are combined using a matrix to develop an overall composite loan quality risk rating. The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The Special Mention category includes assets that are fundamentally sound yet, exhibit potentially unacceptable credit risk or deteriorating trends or characteristics which if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company s credit position at some future date. Loans in the Substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. All loans greater than days past due are considered Substandard. Loans in the Doubtful category have all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans in the Loss category are considered uncollectible and of little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. To help ensure that risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Company has a structured loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the Pass categories unless a specific action, such as bankruptcy, repossession, or 

 F- 24 

or greater. Confirmation of the appropriate risk grade is included in the review on an ongoing basis. The Company engages an external consultant to conduct loan reviews on at least a semiannual basis. Generally, the external consultant reviews commercial relationships greater than and/or all criticized relationships equal to or greater than . Detailed reviews, including plans for resolution, are performed on loans classified as Substandard on a quarterly basis. Loans in the Substandard category that are evaluated for impairment are given separate consideration in the determination of the allowance. The Bank uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Pass. Loans classified as pass are loans in which the condition of the borrower and the performance of the loans are satisfactory of better Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful . Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

There were loans greater than 90 days delinquent and still accruing interest at September 30, 2024 and 2023. We maintain the ACL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated credit losses in the loan portfolios as of the balance sheet date. We established our allowance in accordance with guidance provided in Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ("ASC 326"). The allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of expected losses inherent in the Company s lending activities excluding loans accounted for under fair value. The allowance for credit losses are maintained through charges to the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income as expected losses are estimated. Loans or portions thereof that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. We maintain a credit review system, which allows for a periodic review of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential non performing loans. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers. General credit loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including, but not limited to, actual credit loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, management s judgment and losses which are probable and reasonably estimable. The allowance is increased through provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loans that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. While management uses available information to recognize probable and reasonably estimable loan losses, future credit provisions may be necessary, based on changing economic conditions. Payments received on non performing loans generally are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal. The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 was maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable. In addition, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses. The banking regulators may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on its analysis and review of information available to it at the time of its examination. Management reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis using a defined, consistently applied process in order to make appropriate and timely adjustments to the ACL. When information confirms all or part of specific loans to be uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged off against the ACL.

The shift in allocation and the changes in the provision for credit losses for the year ending September 30, 2024 are primarily due to changes in the credit metrics within the loan portfolio and the ACL model coupled with the adoption of CECL on October 1, 2023. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the allowance for loan loss for commercial real estate loans increased million due primarily to an increase in commercial real estate loans of million. Credit provisions were recorded for loan loss for the commercial loans, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and auto loans segments due to either decreased loan balances, improved asset quality, changes in the loan mix within the pool, and/or decreased charge-off activity in those segments.

Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing term extensions and interest rate reductions. In some cases, the Company provides multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as and interest rate reduction, may be granted.

On October 1, 2023, the Bank adopted ASU 2022-02 on a modified retrospective basis. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the TDR accounting model, and requires that the Bank evaluate, based on the accounting for loan modifications, whether the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the modification results in a more-than-insignificant direct change in the contractual cash flows and represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. This change required all loan modifications to be accounted for under the general loan modification guidance in ASC 310-20, Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, and subject entities to new disclosure requirements on loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Upon adoption of CECL, the TDRs were evaluated and included in the CECL loan segment pools if the loans shared similar risk characteristics to other loans in the pool or remained with individually evaluated loans for which the ACL was measured using the collateral-dependent or discounted cash flow method.

The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when management believes that the deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized either through a carryback to taxable income in prior years, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and, to a lesser extent, future taxable income. Accounting principles prescribe a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. There is currently liability for uncertain tax positions and known unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company s federal and state income tax returns for taxable years through 2019 have been closed for purposes of examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.

The commitments outstanding at September 30, 2024, contractually mature in . The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The amount of collateral obtained, as deemed necessary, is based upon management s credit evaluation in compliance with the lending policy guidelines. Since many of the credit line commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon, the total contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees represent conditional commitments issued to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party. The coverage period for these instruments is typically a one-year period with renewal option subject to prior approval by management. Fees earned from the issuance of these letters are recognized over the coverage period. For secured letters of credit, the collateral is typically Company deposit instruments. The Company is required to maintain a reserve balance with certain third party providers. At September 30, 2024 the reserve balance was million. Legal Proceedings The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of Management, the resolution of these legal actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. The Company and its subsidiary, ESSA Bank and Trust ESSA B T were named as defendants, among others, in an action commenced on December 8, 2016 by plaintiff who sought to pursue the suit as a class action on behalf of the entire class of people similarly situated. The plaintiff alleged that a subsidiary of a bank previously acquired by the Company received unearned fees and kickbacks in the process of making loans, in violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. In an order dated January 29, 2018, the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the case. The plaintiff appealed the court s ruling. In an opinion and order dated April 26, 2019, the appellate court reversed the district court s order dismissing the plaintiff s case against the Company and remanded the case to the district court in order to continue the litigation. The litigation is now proceeding before the district court. On December 9, 2019, the court permitted an amendment to the complaint to add new plaintiffs to the case asserting similar claims. On May 21, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification. Fact and expert discovery were completed, and the Company and ESSA B T filed motions seeking to have the case dismissed (in whole or in part) and/or the class de-certified, as well as for other relief. Plaintiffs opposed the motions. On August 18, 2023 the Court granted the motions to dismiss as to the Company and ESSA B T, with the result that the only remaining defendant is a now-dissolved former wholly-owned subsidiary of a previously-acquired company. The Court also amended its class certification order, and severed one of the original plaintiffs claims from those of the class, ordering a separate trial for that plaintiff. Plaintiffs sought permission to appeal from these and other related rulings but the court denied their request. Plaintiffs have filed a motion seeking relief from some of the court s prior orders. The Company and ESSA B T will continue to vigorously defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Company and/or ESSA B T, the amount or range of such exposure is not currently estimable but could be substantial 

 F- 36 

plaintiffs who also sought to pursue the action as a class action on behalf of the entire class of people similarly situated. The plaintiffs allege that a subsidiary of a bank previously acquired by the Company received unearned fees and kickbacks from a different title company than the one involved in the previously discussed litigation in the process of making loans. The original complaint alleged violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Sherman Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO ). The plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on September 30, 2020 that dropped the RICO claim, but they are continuing to pursue the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Sherman Act claims. The defendants moved to dismiss the Sherman Act claim on October 14, 2020, and that motion was denied on April 2, 2021. On March 13, 2023 the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. The case is currently in the discovery phase. The Company and ESSA B T intend to vigorously defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Company and/or ESSA B T, the amount or range of such exposure is not currently estimable but could be substantial.

of service with the Company or its subsidiary and attained age . The ESOP trust acquired shares of the Company s stock in 2007 from proceeds from a loan with the Company. The Company makes cash contributions to the ESOP on an annual basis sufficient to enable the ESOP to make the required loan payments. Cash dividends paid on allocated shares are distributed to participants and cash dividends paid on unallocated shares are used to repay the outstanding debt of the ESOP. The ESOP trust s outstanding loan bears interest at prime, adjustable each January 1 st , which was at September 30, 2024 and requires an annual payment of principal and interest through . The Company s ESOP, which is internally leveraged, does not report the loans receivable extended to the ESOP as assets and does not report the ESOP debt due to the Company. As the debt is repaid, shares are released from the collateral and allocated to qualified employees based on the proportion of payments made during the year to the remaining amount of payments due on the loan through maturity. Accordingly, the shares pledged as collateral are reported as unallocated common stock held by the ESOP shares in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As shares are released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the current market price of the shares, and the shares become outstanding for earnings-per-share computations. The Company recognized ESOP expense of for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Equity Incentive Plan The Company previously maintained the ESSA Bancorp, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ). The Plan provided for a total of shares of common stock for issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards. Of the shares available under the Plan, were available to be issued in connection with the exercise of stock options and were available to be issued as restricted stock. The Plan allowed for the granting of non-qualified stock options NSOs ), incentive stock options ISOs ), and restricted stock. Options under the plan were granted at no less than the fair value of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. As of the effective date of the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (detailed below), further grants will be made under the plan and forfeitures of outstanding awards under the plan will be added to the shares available under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. The Company replaced the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan with the ESSA Bancorp, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan ). The 2016 Plan provides for a total of shares of common stock for issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards. The 2016 Plan allows for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. The Company replaced the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan with the ESSA Bancorp, Inc. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2024 Plan ). The 2024 Plan which was approved by shareholders on March 7, 2024, provides for a total of shares of common stock for issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards. The 2024 Plan allows for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. The Company classifies share-based compensation for employees and outside directors within Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income to correspond with the same line item as compensation paid. Restricted stock shares outstanding at September 30, 2024 vest over periods ranging from to . The product of the number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the Company s common stock determines the fair value of restricted shares under the Company s restricted stock plan. The Company expenses the fair value of all share based compensation grants over the requisite service period. During the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded and of share-based compensation expense consisting of restricted stock expense. Expected future compensation expense relating to the restricted shares outstanding, at September 30, 2024 is over the remaining vesting period of years.

Defined Benefit Plan The Bank sponsors a trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and officers. The plan calls for benefits to be paid to eligible employees at retirement based primarily upon years of service with the Bank and compensation rates near retirement. The Bank s funding policy is to make annual contributions, if needed, based upon the funding formula developed by the plan s actuary. In February 2017, the Bank amended the defined benefit pension plan to provide that no additional participants would enter the plan and no additional benefits would accrue beyond February 28, 2017.

Each financial asset and liability is identified as having been valued according to a specified level of input, 1, 2 or 3. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy, within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls, has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset.

Foreclosed Real Estate Owned Foreclosed real estate owned is measured at fair value, less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure; valuations are periodically performed by management; and the assets are carried at fair value, less cost to sell. Income and expenses from operations and changes in valuation allowance are included in the net expenses from foreclosed real estate. Derivatives The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income and expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed payments. The fair value of the swap asset and liability is based on an external derivative model using data inputs as of the valuation date and are classified Level 2.

The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged transactions. The Company did not recognize any hedge ineffectiveness in earnings during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features The Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. The Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well / adequately capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company had derivatives in a net asset position and was not required to post collateral against its obligations under these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2024 and 2023, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.

Exhibit 19.1 

 ESSA BANCORP, INC. 
 POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REGARDING INSIDER TRADING AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION 
 
 I. Executive Summary 

This policy provides guidelines to employees, executive officers and directors ESSA Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including ESSA Bank Trust (the Company with respect to transactions in the Company s publicly traded securities, including common stock, options for common stock and any other securities the Company may issue from time to time, such as preferred stock, warrants and convertible debentures. In this policy, the employees, executive officers and directors of the Company are referred to as Insiders. There is a presumption that the restrictions applicable to Insiders apply equally to their spouse, minor children and family members sharing the same home. 
 
 Any person who possesses Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company is deemed to be an Insider for so long as the information is not publicly known or disclosed. 
 
 II. Material Nonpublic Information 

It is not possible to define all categories of material information. However, information should be regarded as material if there is a reasonable likelihood that it would be considered important to an investor in making an investment decision regarding the purchase or sale of the Company s securities. 
 
 	 While it may be difficult under this standard to determine whether particular information is material, there are various categories of information that are particularly sensitive and, as a general rule, should always be considered material. Either positive or negative information may be material. Examples of such information may include but are not limited to: 
 
 Financial results					 

Projections of future earnings or losses 

News of a pending or proposed merger or acquisition 

News of the disposition of a subsidiary 

Impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems 

Gain or loss of a substantial customer or supplier 

Changes in dividend or stock repurchase policies 

Stock splits 

New equity or debt offerings 

Significant litigation exposure due to actual or threatened litigation 

Major changes in senior management 

Nonpublic information is information that has not been previously disclosed to the general public and is otherwise not readily available to the general public. 
 
 III. General Policy 

It is the policy of the Company to prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company acquired in the workplace or otherwise and to prohibit the misuse of Material Nonpublic Information in securities trading. Remember, anyone scrutinizing your transactions will be doing so after the fact, with the benefit of hindsight. As a practical matter, before engaging in any transaction, you should carefully consider how enforcement authorities and others might view the transaction in hindsight. 
 
 IV. Specific Polices 

1. Trading on Material Nonpublic Information. No Insider shall engage in any transaction involving a purchase or sale of the Company s securities, including any offer to purchase or offer to sell, during any period commencing with the date that he or she possesses Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company, and ending at the close of business on the trading day following the date of public disclosure of that information, or at such time as such nonpublic information is no longer material. As used herein, the term trading day shall mean a day on which the Nasdaq Global Market is open for trading. 

2. Earnings Releases and Black Out Period for Trading. As a precaution, the Company specifically prohibits Regulatory Insiders and a specifically identified group of employees from engaging in any transaction involving a purchase or sale of the Company s securities during any period commencing at the end of the day on the fifteenth calendar day of the third month of each calendar quarter, and ending at the close of business on the trading day following the date of public disclosure of financial information for that quarter/year end (the black-out period ). The Company s directors and its executive officers are considered Regulatory Insiders . The specifically identified group of employees will be determined by the Chief Executive Officer, and will generally consist of those employees who have routine access to Material Nonpublic Information, especially information regarding the financial condition and performance of the Company. It should be noted that just because an individual is not subject to this black out period for trading, the prohibition on trading while in possession of Material Nonpublic Information applies to everyone, within or without the black out period. 

3. Tipping. No Insider shall disclose tip Material Nonpublic Information to any other person, including, but not limited to, family members or members of an insider s household, where such information may be used by such person to his or her profit by trading in the securities of companies to which such information relates, nor shall such Insider or related person make recommendations or express opinions on the basis of Material Nonpublic Information as to trading in the Company s securities. 

2 

4. Confidentiality of Nonpublic Information. Nonpublic information relating to the Company is the property of the Company and the unauthorized disclosure of such information is forbidden. 

V. Potential Criminal and Civil Liability and/or Disciplinary Action 

1. Liability for Insider Trading. Insiders may be subject to disgorgement of profits, or losses avoided, monetary penalties and/or time in jail for engaging in transactions in the Company s securities at a time when the Insider has knowledge of Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company. 

2. Liability for Tipping. Insiders may also be liable for improper transactions by any person, commonly referred to the tippee, to whom they have disclosed Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company or to whom they have made recommendations or expressed opinions on the basis of such information as to trading in the Company s securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC has imposed large penalties even when the disclosing person did not profit from the trading. The SEC and the stock exchanges use sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques to uncover insider-trading activities. 

3. Possible Disciplinary Actions. Employees and directors of the Company who violate this Policy shall also be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, which may include immediate termination of employment or service. 

VI. Applicability of Policy to Inside Information Regarding Other Companies 

This policy and the guidelines described herein also apply to Material Nonpublic Information relating to other companies, including the Company s and the Bank s customers, vendors, suppliers or acquisition candidates business partners when that information is obtained in the course of employment with, or other services performed on behalf of, the Company. Civil and criminal penalties and termination of employment may result from trading on inside information regarding the Company s business partners. All employees should treat Material Nonpublic Information about the Company s business partners with the same care required with respect to information related directly to the Company. 
 
 VII. Certain Exceptions 

1. Stock Option Exercises. The Company s insider trading policy does not apply to the exercise of an employee stock option, or to the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements. The policy does apply, however, to any sale of stock following exercise, or as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise, of an option, or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option. 

3 

2. 401(k) Plan. The Company s insider trading policy does not apply to ongoing purchases of Company stock in the 401(k) plan resulting from the periodic contribution of money to the plan pursuant to your payroll deduction election. The policy does apply, however, to elections you may make under the 401(k) plan, including (a) an election to commence or terminate purchases of Common Stock through the 401(k) plan; (b) an election to increase or decrease the percentage of your periodic contributions that will be allocated to the Company stock fund; (c) an election to make an intra-plan transfer of an existing account balance into or out of the Company stock fund; (d) an election to borrow money against your 401(k) plan account if the loan will result in a liquidation of some or all of your Company stock fund balance; and (e) your election to pre-pay a plan loan if the pre-payment will result in an allocation of loan proceeds to the Company stock fund. 

3. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. The Company s insider trading policy does not apply to ongoing purchases of Company stock under the Company s dividend reinvestment plan resulting from your reinvestment of dividends paid on Company securities and the periodic contribution of money to the stock purchase plan pursuant to your bank account deduction election. The policy does apply, however, to voluntary purchases of Company stock resulting from additional contributions you choose to make to the plan, and to your election to participate in the plan or increase or decrease your level of participation in the plan. The policy also applies to your sale of any Company stock purchased pursuant to the plan. 

4. 10b5 Plans. The Company s insider trading policy does not apply to purchases or sales of Company stock under a pre-approved trading plan that complies with Rule 10b5-1 of the SEC. The policy does apply, however, to the election by an individual or the Company to enter into a 10b5 plan. 

5. Charitable Contributions. The Company does not believe that Regulatory Insiders should be prohibited from making bona fide gifts and charitable donations outside the trading window in situations where there is no unusual activity or other reason to believe that a transaction would be particularly risky. As with other transactions in the Company s securities, and as explained below, Regulatory Insiders need to pre-clear these transactions. 

VIII. Additional Prohibited Transactions 

The Company considers it improper and inappropriate for any director, executive officer or other employee of the Company to engage in short-term or speculative transactions in the Company s securities. It therefore is the Company s policy that directors, executive officers and other employees may not engage in any of the following transactions: 
 1. Short Sales. Short sales of the Company s securities evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value, and therefore signal to the market that the seller has no confidence in the Company or its short-term 

4 

prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce the seller s incentive to improve the Company s performance. For these reasons, short sales of the Company s securities are prohibited by this policy. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Securities and Exchange Act prohibits executive officers and directors from engaging in short sales. 

2. Margin Accounts and Pledges by Regulatory Insiders. Securities held in a margin account may be sold by the broker without the customer s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Because a margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of Material Nonpublic Information or is not permitted to trade in Company securities, directors and executive officers are discouraged from pledging Company securities as collateral for margin purchases or a loan. If Company securities are pledged as collateral for margin purchases or a loan by a Regulatory Insider , the Investor Relations Officer must be informed. The SEC now requires annual proxy statement disclosure as to the number of shares pledged by directors and executive officers. 

3. Post-Termination Transactions. This Policy continues to apply to your transactions in Company securities even after you have terminated employment with the Company. If you are in possession of Material Nonpublic Information when your employment terminates, you may not trade in Company securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. 

IX. Additional Information Regulatory Insiders and the Pre-Clearance of All Transactions 

Regulatory Insiders of the Company must also comply with the reporting obligations and limitations on short-swing transactions set forth in Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. While such provisions are quite complex under the Act, the practical effect of these provisions is that Regulatory Insiders who purchase and sell (or sell and purchase) the Company s securities within a six-month period must forfeit, or disgorge, all profits to the Company whether or not they had knowledge of any Material Nonpublic Information. Under these provisions, and so long as certain other criteria are met, neither the receipt of an option under the Company s option plans, nor the exercise of that option nor the receipt of stock under the Company s employee stock purchase plan, if applicable, is deemed a purchase under Section 16. However, the sale of any such shares relative to the above-mentioned programs is considered a sale under Section 16. 
 
 	All Regulatory Insiders are required to file a Form 4 with the SEC within two business days of a transaction related to Company stock. The filing of these forms is the responsibility of the respective Regulatory Insider but are coordinated and filed by the Company. 
 
 5 

In an effort to maintain compliance with the strict timeframes of Section 16 and the policies referenced herein, all trades by a Regulatory Insider and the specifically identified group of employees must be pre-approved through the Investor Relations Officer/Filing Coordinator prior to the execution of that trade. Therefore, such persons must notify the Investor Relations Officer/Filing Coordinator prior to engaging in a stock sale or purchase.
