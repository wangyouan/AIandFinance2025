Notes: 

(1) During the first quarter of our fiscal
year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), was
damaged by a fire which caused it to be closed since the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. During the first quarter of our fiscal
year 2023, we opened our newly built stand-alone package liquor store on this site (2505 N. University Drive, Building A, Hollywood, Florida)
(Store #19P), replacing our package liquor store destroyed by fire and previously operating here. Store #19P is now reflected in the above
chart as a stand-alone liquor store, rather than as a combination unit. Store #19R, a stand-alone restaurant building on this site, (2505
N. University Drive, Building B, Hollywood, Florida) opened on March 26, 2024 (adjacent to the package liquor store), and replaced our
restaurant destroyed by fire and previously operating here. Store #19R is now reflected in the above chart as a stand-alone restaurant,
rather than as a combination unit. 

(2) We operate a restaurant for one (1) franchisee.
This unit is included in the table both as a franchised restaurant, as well as a restaurant operated by us.

History and Development of Our Business 

We were incorporated in Florida
in 1959 and commenced operating as a chain of small cocktail lounges and package liquor stores throughout South Florida. By 1970, we had
established a chain of "Big Daddy's" lounges and package liquor stores between Vero Beach and Homestead, Florida. From 1970
to 1979, we expanded our package liquor store and lounge operations throughout Florida and opened clubs in five other "Sun Belt"
states. In 1975, we discontinued most of our package store operations in Florida except in the South Florida areas of Miami-Dade, Broward,
Palm Beach and Monroe Counties. In 1982, we expanded our club operations into the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area as general partner of
several limited partnerships we organized. In March 1985, we began franchising package liquor stores and lounges in the South Florida
area. (See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion of franchised units on pages 3 and 4). 

During our fiscal year 1987, we
began renovating our lounges to provide full restaurant food service, and subsequently renovated and added food service to most of our
lounges. Food sales currently represent approximately 79.28 and bar sales approximately 20.72 of our total restaurant sales. 

Our package liquor stores emphasize
high volume business by providing customers with a wide variety of brand name and private label merchandise at discount prices. Our restaurants
and our sports bar establishment offer alcoholic beverages and food service with abundant portions and reasonable prices, served in a
relaxed, friendly and casual atmosphere. 

We conduct our operations directly
and through a number of limited partnerships and wholly owned subsidiaries, all of which are listed below. Our subsidiaries and the limited
partnerships, (except for the limited partnership, where we are not the general partner, which owns and operates our franchised restaurant
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida) are reported on a consolidated basis.

Package Liquor Store Operations 

Our package liquor stores emphasize
high volume business by providing customers with a wide selection of brand name and private label liquors, beers and wines while offering
competitive pricing by meeting the published sales prices of our competitors. We provide sales training to our package liquor store personnel.
The stores are open for business seven days a week from 9:00-10:00 a.m. to 10:00-11:00 p.m., depending upon demand and local law. Most
of our units have "night windows" with extended evening hours. 

Company-Owned Package Liquor
Stores . As of our fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, we own and operate eleven package liquor stores in the South Florida area
under the name Big Daddy s Liquors or Big Daddy s Wine Liquors , two of which are jointly
operated with restaurants we own. 

Franchised Package Liquor Stores .
We currently franchise three package liquor stores, all in the South Florida area, all of which are operated under the name Big
Daddy s Liquors . Of the three franchised package liquor stores, two are jointly operated with our franchisee s restaurant
operations and one is operated in a freestanding building adjacent to the franchisee s restaurant operation. Two of the three franchised
package liquor stores are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors. We have not entered
into a franchise arrangement for either a package liquor store, restaurant or combination package liquor store/restaurant since 1986 and
do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future. 

Generally, a franchise agreement
with our franchisees for the operation of a package liquor store runs for the balance of the term of the franchisee s lease for
the business premises, extended by the franchisee s continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or
ownership. In exchange for our providing management and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee
to use our service mark, Big Daddy s Liquors , franchisees of package liquor stores pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a
royalty equal to approximately 1 of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1.5 to 3 of gross sales generated
at the stores depending upon our actual advertising costs. 

For accounting purposes, we do
not consolidate the revenue and expenses of our franchisees operations with our revenue and expenses. Franchise royalties we receive
are recognized as revenue when sales are made by franchisees. 

Restaurant Operations 

Our restaurants provide a neighborhood
casual, standardized dining experience, typical of casual restaurant chains. The interior decor of the restaurants is nautical with numerous
fishing and boating pictures and decorations. The restaurants are designed to permit minor modifications without significant capital expenditures.
However, from time to time we are required to redesign and refurbish the restaurants at significant cost. Drink prices may vary between
locations to meet local conditions. Food prices are substantially standardized for all restaurants. The restaurants' hours of operation
are from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00-5:00 a.m. depending upon demand and local law. 

Company-Owned Restaurants .
As of our fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, we own and operate eleven restaurants all under our service mark Flanigan s
Seafood Bar and Grill two of which are jointly operated with package liquor stores we own. 

Franchised Restaurants .
We franchise five restaurants, all of which operate under our service mark Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill , two of
which operate as a restaurant only, two of which operate jointly with a franchisee operated Big Daddy s Liquors package
liquor store and one of which operates adjacent to a Big Daddy s Liquors package liquor store. Four of the five franchised
restaurants are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors. We have not entered into
a franchise arrangement for either a package liquor store, restaurant or combination package liquor store/restaurant since 1986 and do
not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future. 

Generally, a franchise agreement
with our franchisees for the operation of a restaurant runs for the balance of the term of the franchisee s lease for the business
premises, extended by the franchisee s continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or ownership. In
exchange for our providing management and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee to use our service
mark, Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill , our franchisees pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a royalty equal to approximately
3 of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1.5 to 3 of gross sales from the restaurants depending upon
our actual advertising costs. 

For accounting purposes, we do
not consolidate the revenue and expenses of our franchisees operations with our revenue and expenses. Franchise royalties we receive
are recognized as revenue when sales are made by franchisees.

Restaurants Owned by Affiliated Limited Partnerships 

We have invested along with others,
(some of whom are or are affiliated with our officers and directors), in eleven limited partnerships which currently own and operate eleven
South Florida based restaurants under our service mark Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill . In addition to being a limited
partner in these limited partnerships, we are the sole general partner of ten of these limited partnerships and manage and control the
operations of these restaurants except for the restaurant located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida where we only hold a limited partnership
interest. 

Generally, the terms of the limited partnership agreements
provide that until the investors cash investment in a limited partnership (including any cash invested by us) is returned in full,
(available cash is distributed to the investors pro-rata based on ownership interest), the limited partnership distributes to the investors
annually out of available cash from the operation of the restaurant, as a return of capital, up to 25 of the cash invested in the limited
partnership, with no management fee paid to us. Any available cash in excess of the 25 of the cash invested in the limited partnership
distributed to the investors annually, is paid one-half ) to us as a management fee and one-half ) to the investors,
(including us), pro-rata based on the investors investment, as a return of capital. Once all of the investors, (including us),
have received, in full, amounts equal to their cash invested, an annual management fee becomes payable to us equal to one-half )
of cash available to be distributed, with the other one-half ) of available cash distributed to the investors (including us),
as a profit distribution, pro-rata based on the investors investment. As of September 28, 2024, all limited partnerships, with
the exception of the limited partnership which owns the restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85), which opened for business in March
2022 and the limited partnership which owns the restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25), which opened for business in April 2023, have
returned all cash invested and we receive an annual management fee equal to one-half ) of the cash available for distribution
by the limited partnership. 

In addition to receipt of distributable amounts from
the limited partnerships, we receive a fee equal to 3 of gross sales for use of our service marks Flanigan s Seafood Bar
and Grill or Flanigan s , which use is authorized while we act as general partner only. This 3 fee is earned 
when sales are made by the limited partnerships and is paid weekly, in arrears. Whether we will have any additional restaurants in the
future will be dependent, among other things, on market conditions and our ability to raise capital. We anticipate that we will continue
to form limited partnerships to raise funds to own and operate restaurants under our service marks Flanigan s Seafood Bar
and Grill or Flanigan s using the same or substantially similar financial arrangements.

of this limited partnership, we do not receive an annual management fee. We have a franchise arrangement with this limited partnership
and for accounting purposes, we do not consolidate the operations of this limited partnership into our operations.

Management Agreement for The Whale s Rib Restaurant 

Since January 2006, we have managed
 The Whale s Rib , a casual dining restaurant located in Deerfield Beach, Florida, pursuant to a management agreement.
We paid 500,000 in exchange for our rights to manage this restaurant. The restaurant is owned by a third party unaffiliated with us.
In exchange for providing management, bookkeeping and related services, we receive one-half ) of the net profit, if any, from
the operation of the restaurant. For our fiscal years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we generated 200,000 and 400,000
respectively of revenue each fiscal year from providing these management services. 

Operations and Management 

We emphasize systematic operations
and control of all package liquor stores and restaurants regardless of whether we own, franchise or manage the unit. Each unit has its
own manager who is responsible for monitoring inventory levels, supervising sales personnel, food preparation and service in restaurants
and generally assuring that the unit is managed in accordance with our guidelines and procedures. We have in effect an incentive cash
bonus program for our managers and salespersons based upon various performance criteria. Our operations are supervised by supervisors,
who visit all Company, limited partnership and franchise owned units and the managed unit to provide on-site management and support. There
are three supervisors responsible for package liquor store operations and six supervisors responsible for restaurant operations. 

All of our managers and salespersons
receive extensive training in sales techniques. We arrange for independent third parties, or "shoppers", to inspect each unit
in order to evaluate the unit's operations, including the handling of cash transactions. 

Purchasing and Inventory 

The package liquor business requires
a constant substantial capital investment in inventory at the stores. Our inventory consists primarily of liquor and wine products and
as such, does not become excessive or obsolete that would require identifying and recording of the same. Liquor inventory purchased can
normally be returned only if defective or broken. 

All of our purchases of liquor
inventory are made through our purchasing department from our corporate headquarters. The major portion of inventory is purchased under
individual purchase orders with licensed wholesalers and distributors who deliver the merchandise within one or two days of the placing
of an order. Frequently there is only one wholesaler in the immediate marketing area with an exclusive distributorship of certain liquor
product lines. Substantially all of our liquor inventory is shipped by the wholesalers or distributors directly to our stores. We significantly
increase our inventory prior to Christmas, New Year's Eve and other holidays. Under Florida law, we are required to pay for our liquor
purchases within ten days of delivery. 

Negotiations with food suppliers
are conducted by our purchasing department at our corporate headquarters. We believe this ensures that the best quality and prices will
be available to each restaurant. Orders for food products are regularly prepared by each restaurant's kitchen manager and reviewed by
the restaurant's general manager before orders are placed. Food is delivered by the supplier directly to each restaurant. Orders are placed
several times a week to ensure product freshness. Food inventory is primarily paid for monthly. We purchase food and other commodities
for use in our operations based on market prices established with our suppliers. Many of the food products purchased by us can be subject
to price volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control. We mitigate the risk of supply shortages and obtain
competitive prices by utilizing multiple qualified suppliers for substantially all our food products. 

We negotiate short-term and long-term
agreements for certain of our principal food product requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. We evaluate the
possibility of entering into arrangements to assist us in managing risk and variability associated with the supply and demand of food
products. 

In order to fix the cost and ensure adequate supply
of baby back ribs for our restaurants for calendar year 2025, we entered into a purchase agreement with a new rib supplier, whereby we
agreed to purchase approximately 7.8 million of 2.5 Down Baby Back Ribs (weight range in which baby back ribs are
sold) during calendar year 2025, at a prescribed cost, which we believe is competitive. For calendar year 2024, we entered into a purchase
agreement with our current rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately 7.0 million of 2.25 Down Baby Back
Ribs during calendar year 2024, at a prescribed cost, which we also believe is competitive. The increase in our cost of baby back
ribs for calendar year 2025 compared to calendar year 2024 is due to our purchase of larger sized baby back ribs and the purchase of baby
back ribs for Store #19R, Hollywood, Florida for the entire calendar year, offset by a decrease in market price. 

While we anticipate purchasing
all of our rib supply from this new vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed.

Information Technology 

Our
restaurant and package liquor store point-of-sale and back-office systems provide information regarding daily sales, cash receipts, inventory,
food and beverage costs, labor costs and other controllable operating expenses. Our restaurants and package liquor stores offer online
ordering for to-go sales and our package liquor stores also offer delivery services by third-party vendors. 

Restaurant
and package liquor store hardware and software support is provided by both our internal support services team as well as third-party vendors. Each
restaurant and package liquor store has a private high-speed wide area connection to send and receive critical business data as well as
to access web-based applications securely as well as a failover capability. All of our core and critical applications are backed
up to external data centers. To mitigate business interruptions, we utilize a data backup and replication infrastructure between
our onsite and external data centers, so all data is replicated nightly between the sites. 

We require cybersecurity awareness training for all
staff members with access to our cyber systems. We also maintain cyber risk insurance coverage to further reduce our risk profile. Security
of our financial data and other sensitive information remains a high priority for us, led by our information technology department. In
an effort to further secure our customers credit card information, we employ an encryption and tokenization platform for all credit
card transactions in our restaurants, ensuring no credit card data is stored in our internal systems. We also transact business through
online ordering for both our restaurants and package liquor stores through third party vendors. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors and the discussion
of cybersecurity risks and Item 1C information on cybersecurity risk management.) 

Government Regulation 

Our operations are subject to
various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. In particular, our operations are subject to regulation by federal agencies
and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, food preparation and safety, sanitation, alcoholic beverage control, safety
and fire department agencies in the state or municipality where our units are located. 

Alcoholic beverage control regulations
require each of our restaurants and package liquor stores to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages from a state authority and in
certain locations, county and municipal authorities. 

In Florida, where all of our restaurants
and package liquor stores are located, most of our liquor licenses are issued on a "quota license" basis. Quota licenses are
issued on the basis of a population count established from time to time under the latest applicable census. Because the total number of
liquor licenses available under a quota license system is limited and restrictions are placed upon their transfer, the licenses have purchase
and resale value based upon supply and demand in the particular areas in which they are issued. The quota licenses held by us allow the
sale of liquor for on and off premises consumption (the 4 COP Quota Liquor License ). The other liquor licenses held by us
or limited partnerships of which we are the general partner, are restaurant liquor licenses, which do not have quota restrictions or purchase
or resale value. A restaurant liquor license is issued to every applicant who meets all of the state and local licensing requirements,
including, but not limited to zoning and minimum restaurant size, seating and menu. The restaurant liquor licenses held by us allow the
sale of liquor for on premises consumption only. 

All licenses must be renewed annually
and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Suspension or revocation may result from violation by the licensee or its employees
of any federal, state or local law regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate
to numerous aspects of the daily operations of our units, including, minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operations, advertising,
wholesale purchasing, inventory control, handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages, internal control and accounting. 

As the sale of alcoholic beverages
constitutes a large share of our revenue, the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining a liquor license in a particular location
could adversely affect our operations in that location and could impair our ability to obtain licenses elsewhere. 

During our fiscal years 2024 and
2023, no significant pending matters have been initiated concerning any of our licenses which might be expected to result in a revocation
of a liquor license or other significant actions against us. 

We are subject to dram-shop 
statutes due to our restaurant operations. These statutes generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover
damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated individual. We carry liquor liability coverage
as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, which we believe is consistent with coverage carried by other entities
in the restaurant industry. Although we are covered by insurance, a judgment against us under a dram-shop statute in excess of our liability
coverage could have a material adverse effect on us. We currently have no dram shop claims. 

7 

Our operations are also subject
to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship requirements and overtime. Significant numbers
of hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates related to the federal or Florida minimum wage, whichever is higher, and accordingly,
increases in the minimum wage will increase labor costs. We are also subject to the Americans with Disability Act of 1990 (ADA), which,
among other things, may require certain renovations to our restaurants to meet federally mandated requirements. The cost of any such renovations
is not expected to materially affect us. 

A significant number of our hourly
restaurant staff members receive income from gratuities. Many of our locations participate voluntarily in a Tip Reporting Alternative
Commitment TRAC agreement with the Internal Revenue Service IRS ). By complying with the educational and
other requirements of the TRAC agreement, we reduce the likelihood of potential employer-only Federal
Insurance Contributions Act (FICA tax assessments for unreported or underreported tips. We are not under investigation or audit, nor
have we been assessed for potential employer-only FICA tax assessments for unreported or underreported tips. 

We are also subject to laws relating
to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit protection and fraud. 

We are not aware of any statute,
ordinance, rule or regulation under present consideration which would significantly limit or restrict our business as now conducted. However,
in view of the number of local jurisdictions within the State of Florida in which we conduct business, and the highly regulated nature
of the liquor business, there can be no assurance that additional limitations may not be imposed in the future, even though none are presently
anticipated. 

Human Capital 

We
depend on our staff members to successfully execute all aspects of our day-to-day operations. Our ability to attract highly motivated
staff members and retain an engaged, experienced team is key to successful execution of our strategy. We are currently operating in a
competitive labor environment. If we are unable to hire or retain qualified restaurant management and operating personnel in an increasingly
competitive market, we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect
our financial performance. 

Development and Training 

We
invest resources to ensure our staff receive training in order to maximize their potential. In addition, we strive to provide our staff
with career advancement opportunities. Our training programs allow us to fill certain of our management positions with internal candidates. 

Benefits and Wellness 

We
believe access to healthcare is a compelling benefit for many staff members and we offer healthcare benefits to our hourly staff members
who work a minimum of 30 hours per week, on average. We attempt to provide a robust suite of benefits and wellness offerings. 

Employee Engagement 

Listening
to our staff members is an essential part of building an engaged workforce, and we provide avenues for staff to share their ideas and
concerns. 

As
of our fiscal year end 2024, we employed 1,990 persons, of which 669 were full-time and 1,321 were part-time. Of these, 57 were employed
at our corporate offices in administrative capacities and 12 were employed in maintenance. Of the remaining employees, 74 were employed
in our package liquor stores and 1,847 in our restaurants. None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining organizations.
We consider our labor relations to be favorable. 

8 

Giving Back 

Another
key aspect of our culture is giving back to the communities where our staff live and work, and uniting our staff members around charitable
causes personal to them. We periodically donate to philanthropic organizations through campaigns designed to engage our staff company-wide
service programs, as follows: 

Breast Cancer Awareness We donate 10,000 annually to local Breast Cancer Support organizations. 

Donated over 100,000 in total to HOPE mission. Money is used for disaster and hunger relief all over the world, youth outreach, and community building. 

Achievement Awards We provide schools in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach County with free meal coins and achievement awards throughout the year. We give out approximately 85,000 awards every year. 

Fishing Tournaments/Marine Conservation We donate to fishing tournaments and beach cleanup projects. 

Supporting the local community We donate funds to boy scouts, baseball teams, schools, etc. 

Sheridan House We donated 500 backpacks to underprivileged children. We also collect and donate school supplies annually. 

Reclaimed Wood All of our locations use reclaimed wood on interior walls. 

We also believe our
sustainability programs and initiatives like restaurant-based recycling and replacing our off-premise packaging with materials that reduce
the use of plastics and improve recyclability serve to foster pride in our staff.

sponsoring a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Employees may contribute
elective deferrals to the plan up to amounts allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. We are not required to contribute to the plan but
may make discretionary profit sharing and/or matching contributions. During our fiscal years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30,
2023, the Board of Directors approved discretionary matching contributions totaling 74,000 and 70,000, respectively.

General Liability Insurance 

For the policy year beginning
December 30, 2023, we have general liability insurance which incorporates a 50,000 self-insured retention per occurrence for us and a
 10,000 self-insured retention per occurrence for the limited partnerships. Our insurance carrier is responsible for 1,000,000 coverage
per occurrence above our self-insured retentions, up to a maximum aggregate of 2,000,000 per year. We were also able to purchase excess
liability insurance whereby our excess insurance carrier is responsible for 10,000,000 coverage above our primary general liability insurance
coverage. We are uninsured against liability claims in excess of 11,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate. We secured general liability
insurance and excess liability insurance to be effective as of December 30, 2024. (See Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of general
liability and excess liability insurance for the period commencing December 30, 2024.) 

Our general policy is to settle
only those legitimate and reasonable claims asserted and to aggressively defend and go to trial, if necessary, on frivolous and unreasonable
claims. Under our current liability insurance policy, certain expenses incurred by us in defending a claim, including attorney's fees,
are a part of our 50,000 self-insured retention, and a part of our limited partnerships 10,000 self-insured retention. 

In accordance with accounting
guidance, we accrue for any liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost
can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, our annual insurance costs may be subject to adjustment from previous estimates as facts and
circumstances change. Our accruals are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the caption "Accounts payable
and accrued expenses". A significant unfavorable judgment or settlement against us in excess of our liability insurance coverage
could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. 

Property Insurance; Windstorm Insurance 

For the policy year beginning
December 30, 2023, our property insurance is a one (1) year policy with an unaffiliated third party insurance carrier, including coverage
for properties leased by us and our consolidated limited partnerships, and provides for full insurance coverage for property losses, including
those caused by windstorms, such as a hurricane. For property losses caused by windstorm, the property insurance has a fixed deductible
of 100,000, plus 5 of all insured losses, per occurrence. For all other property losses, the property insurance has deductibles of 10,000
per location, per occurrence. We secured property insurance, including windstorm coverage, to be effective as of December 30, 2024. (See
Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of property insurance for the period commencing December 30, 2024.) 

Insurance Premiums 

Due to continuing higher interest
rates, for the policy year commencing December 30, 2023 we paid the premiums for property, general liability, excess liability and terrorism
policies in full with premiums totaling approximately 3.92 million which includes coverage for our franchises (of approximately 850,000),
which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. For the policy year commencing December 30, 2024, we will pay the premiums
for property, general liability, excess liability and terrorism policies in full again due to continuing higher interest rates. (See
Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of property, general liability, excess liability, and terrorism insurance policies for the
period commencing December 30, 2024.) 

Competition and the Company's Market 

The liquor and hospitality industries
are highly competitive and are often affected by changes in taste and entertainment trends among the public, by local, national and economic
conditions affecting spending habits, and by population and traffic patterns. We believe that the principal means of competition among
package liquor stores is price and that, in general, the principal means of competition among restaurants include the location, type and
quality of facilities and the type, quality and price of beverage and food served. 

Our package liquor stores compete
directly or indirectly with local retailers and discount superstores . Due to the competitive nature of the liquor industry
in South Florida, we have had to adjust our pricing to stay competitive, including meeting all competitors advertisements subject
to certain limitations. Such practices will continue in the package liquor business. We believe that we have a competitive position in
our market because of widespread consumer recognition of the "Big Daddy's Liquors" and Big Daddy s Wine Liquors 
names. 

Our restaurants compete directly
or indirectly with many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned. Effective August 25, 2024 we increased menu prices
for our bar offerings to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 5.63 annually to offset higher food and liquor costs
and higher overall expenses. Effective March 26, 2023, we increased menu prices for our food offerings to target an increase to our food
revenues of approximately 2.06 annually and on March 20, 2023 we increased menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to
our bar revenues of approximately 5.65 annually to offset higher food and liquor costs and higher overall expenses. We believe that we
have a competitive position in our market because of widespread consumer recognition of the Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill"
and Flanigan s names. 

We have many well-established
competitors, both nationally and locally owned, with substantially greater financial resources than we do. Their resources and market
presence may provide advantages in marketing, purchasing and negotiating leases. We compete with other restaurant and retail establishments
for sites and finding management personnel. 

10 

Our business is subject to seasonal
effects, including that liquor purchases tend to increase during the holiday seasons. 

Trade Names 

We operate our package liquor
stores and restaurants under the service marks: "Big Daddy's Liquors", Big Daddy s Wine Liquors , Flanigan s
Seafood Bar and Grill", and Flanigan s . We operate our sports bar under the service mark: Brendan s
Sports Pub . Our right to the use of the "Big Daddy's" service mark is set forth under a consent decree of a federal court
entered into by us in settlement of federal trademark litigation. The consent decree and the settlement agreement allow us to continue
to use and to expand our use of the "Big Daddy's service mark in connection with our package liquor sales in Florida, while
restricting future liquor sales in Florida under the "Big Daddy's" name by the other party who has a federally registered service
mark for "Big Daddy's" use in the restaurant business. The federal court retained jurisdiction to enforce the consent decree.
We have acquired registered Federal trademarks on the principal register for our Big Daddy s Liquors , "Flanigan's"
and Flanigan s Seafood Bar and Grill service marks. 

The standard symbolic trademark
associated with our facilities and operations is the bearded face and head of "Big Daddy" which is predominantly displayed at
all "Flanigan's" facilities and all "Big Daddy's" facilities throughout the country. The face comprising this trademark
is that of the Company s founder, Joseph "Big Daddy" Flanigan, and is a federally registered trademark owned by us. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

An investment in our common stock
involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and all other information
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties
not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial and therefore not referenced herein, may also become material
and may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties
and you may lose part or all of your investment. 

Certain statements in this report
contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow, capital expenditures,
or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflect management s current
expectations regarding future events and use words such as anticipate , believe , expect , may ,
 will and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of the date they were made and involve a number of risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Several
factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations. New risks and
uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they may arise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to
update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information, future events or other developments,
except as required by applicable laws and regulations. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

If we are unable to
staff and retain qualified restaurant and package liquor store management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market,
we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

Similar
to the broader economy, we are experiencing labor shortfalls relative to our sales levels in certain parts of our workforce. If we are
unable to attract and retain qualified people, our restaurants could be short staffed, we may be forced to incur overtime expenses, and
our ability to operate and expand our concepts effectively and to meet our customers demand could be limited, any of which could
materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

We have experienced
and continue to experience significant labor cost inflation. If we are unable to offset higher labor costs, our cost of doing business
will significantly increase, which could materially adversely impact our financial performance . 

Increases
in minimum wages and minimum tip credit wages, extensions of personal and other leave policies, other governmental regulations affecting
labor costs and a diminishing pool of potential staff members when the unemployment rate falls and legal immigration is restricted, especially
in certain localities, could significantly increase our labor costs and make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants, any of
which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

11 

We
believe the United States federal government may significantly increase the federal minimum wage and tip credit wage (or eliminate the
tip credit wage) and require significantly more mandated benefits than what is currently required under federal law. The State of Florida
has already enacted a minimum wage and tip credit, with the minimum wage currently at 13.00 per hour and a tip credit of 3.02 per hour.
The minimum wage increases 1.00 per hour annually until it reaches 15.00 per hour in 2026. The tip credit does not increase. In addition
to increasing the overall wages paid to our minimum wage and tip credit wage earners, these increases create pressure to increase wages
and other benefits paid to other staff members who, in recognition of their tenure, performance, job responsibilities and other similar
considerations, historically received a rate of pay exceeding the applicable minimum wage or minimum tip credit wage. Because we employ
a large workforce, any wage increase and/or expansion of benefits mandates will have a particularly significant impact on our labor costs.
Our vendors, contractors and business partners are similarly impacted by wage and benefit cost inflation, and many have or will increase
their price for goods, construction and services in order to offset their increasing labor costs. Additionally, while our employees are
not currently covered by any collective bargaining agreements, union organizers may engage in efforts to organize our employees and those
of other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to unionize, our labor costs could increase and it could
negatively impact our culture, reduce our flexibility and disrupt our business. In addition, our responses to any union organizing efforts
could negatively impact our reputation and dissuade guests from patronizing our restaurants. 

Our
labor expenses include significant costs related to our health benefit plans. Health care costs continue to rise and are especially difficult
to project. Material increases in costs associated with medical claims, or an increase in the severity or frequency of such claims, may
cause health care costs to vary substantially from year-over-year. Given the unpredictable nature of actual health care claims trends,
including the severity or frequency of claims, in any given year our health care costs could significantly exceed our estimates,
which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

Any
significant changes to the healthcare insurance system could impact our healthcare costs. Material increases in healthcare costs could
materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

While
we try to offset labor cost increases through price increases, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater
economies of scale, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and respond
to increased labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. 

Our sales and profit growth could be
adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales increases are less than we expect, and we may not successfully increase comparable restaurant
sales or they may decrease. 

While future sales growth
will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the change in period-over-period
sales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth. This is because
the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be
spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability
due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases. There is no assurance
that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2024 due to, among other things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty. 

Our ability to increase comparable
restaurant sales depends on many factors, including: 

perceptions of the Flanigan s brand; 

competition, especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry and from other restaurants whose strategies overlap ours, as well as from grocery stores, meal kit delivery services and other dining options; 

executing our strategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies; 

changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending; 

our ability to increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business; 

weather, natural disasters and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and 

changes in government regulation that may impact customer perceptions of our food. 

As a result, it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable
restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control
and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurant sales increases. 

12 

High unemployment, instability in the housing
market, high energy and food costs and general economic uncertainty could result in a decline in consumer discretionary spending that
would materially affect our financial performance. 

Dining out is a discretionary
expense. Factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions (including
national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability in the housing market,
and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen, our financial performance could
be adversely affected. 

Intense competition in the restaurant and package liquor store industry
could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability. 

The restaurant and package liquor
store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location and many
restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-established competitors with
substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitors are well established
in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores or where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally, other companies may develop
restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. 

Any inability to compete successfully
with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability and
will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may also need to
modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or store concepts
that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these modifications or that these
modifications will not reduce our profitability. 

New information or attitudes regarding diet
and health could result in changes in regulations and consumer eating habits that could adversely affect our revenues. 

Regulations and consumer
eating habits may change because of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may include regulations that
impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number of states, counties and cities
are enacting menu-labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritional information available to guests
or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurant operations is dependent, in part,
upon our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings to trends
in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or delete
certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it could materially affect
customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues. 

Adverse public or medical opinions about health
effects of consuming our products as well as negative publicity about us, our restaurants and/or package liquor stores and about others
across the food and liquor industry supply chain, whether or not accurate, could negatively affect us. 

Restaurant operators have received more scrutiny from
regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consuming certain products. An unfavorable report
on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of those items could influence the demand for our offerings.
In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, of food quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or
operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited number of restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the
food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic
because of these types of health concerns or negative publicity could materially harm our results of operations. 

Our inability to successfully and sufficiently
raise menu prices could result in a decline in profitability. 

We utilize menu price increases
to help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements, construction,
utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted by consumers and reduce
guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected. However, we have not
experienced any adverse effects from past menu price increases. 

13 

Increases in Food Costs, Raw Materials and Other
Supplies and Services Due to Inflation May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. 

Our operating margins depend on,
among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beverage
costs, utilities and other supplies and services due to inflation. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for our
principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we are currently
unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain commodities. Consequently, these commodities can be subject to unforeseen
supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost of key inputs, fuel costs, weather
and other market conditions outside of our control caused by inflation. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. Our
suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higher minimum wage and benefit
costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied
to us. 

Shortages or interruptions in the supply
of food offering ingredients and/or liquor inventory could adversely affect our operating results. 

Our
business is dependent on frequent and consistent deliveries of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory. We may experience shortages,
delays or interruptions in the supply of ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants due to inclement weather, natural disasters,
labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers, distributors or transportation providers or other conditions beyond our
control. In addition, we have a single or a limited number of suppliers for some of our ingredients, including baby back ribs. Although
we believe we have potential alternative suppliers and sufficient reserves of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory, shortages
or interruptions in our supply of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory could adversely affect our financial results. 

Our business could be materially adversely affected
if we are unable to expand in a timely and profitable manner. 

To grow
successfully, we must open new restaurants and/or package liquor stores on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in
restaurant and/or package liquor store openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal year 2024,
we opened our restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) which replaced our restaurant destroyed by fire that previously operated at
that site. 

Our ability to open and profitably
operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availability of suitable and
economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations, the availability of
limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals)
on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors,
the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, variations in labor and
building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results
of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount of time. If we are unable to manage these risks successfully,
we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues which will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,
operating results and cash flow. 

Changes in customer preferences for casual dining
styles could adversely affect financial performance. 

Changing customer preferences,
tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, side dishes
and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. A change from this
dining style may have an adverse effect on our business. 

Our success depends substantially on the value
of our brands and our reputation for offering guests a satisfactory experience. 

We believe we have built a reasonably
strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants. We believe
we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer trust in
or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality, service or ambiance,
or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. 

Our marketing and advertising strategies may
not be successful, which could adversely impact our business. 

From time to time, we introduce
new advertising campaigns and media strategies. If our advertising campaign and new media strategies do not resonate with customers in
the manner we hope, they may not result in increased sales, but would still increase our expenses. We will continue to invest in marketing
and advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers or increase their connection with our brand. If these marketing and
advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant and/or package store sales, the expense associated with these programs will
adversely impact our financial results, and we may not generate the levels of comparable sales we expect. 

14 

Labor shortages, an increase in labor costs, or inability to attract
employees could harm our business. 

Our employees are essential to
our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retain enough
qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience,
our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which
could result in higher labor costs. 

Due to our geographic locations, restaurants
are subject to climate conditions that could affect operations. 

All but one (1) of our restaurants
and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. During hurricane season,
(June 1 through November 30 each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor stores may face harsh weather associated with hurricanes
and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficult for customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor
stores or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurants for a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants
and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected. 

If we were to experience widespread difficulty
renewing existing leases on favorable terms, our revenue or occupancy costs could be adversely affected. 

Most
of the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension
options in the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal of
substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increase
in rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing
leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants. Substantial
increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins. 

Due to our geographic locations, we may not
be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at a reasonable rate. 

Due to the anticipated active
hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurant and package
liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates. If
we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, then we will be self-insured
for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which may have a material adverse effect
upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. 

Our inability or failure to execute a comprehensive business continuity
plan at our restaurant support centers following a disaster or force majeure event could have a material adverse impact on our business.

Many
of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant and package liquor store operations are centralized at
one location. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address crisis-level events, including
hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information.
However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform
vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns
in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation
and exposure to administrative and other legal claims. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty
of accurately and timely predicting, planning for and protecting against the threat. As a result, our disaster recovery procedures and
business continuity plans security may not adequately address all threats we face or protect us from loss. 

Inability to attract and retain customers could
affect results of operations. 

We take pride in our ability to
attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not return and
results may be negatively affected. 

A failure to comply with governmental regulations
could harm our business and our reputation. 

We are subject to regulation by
federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departments relating to
the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to the following: 

the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages; 

employment; 

15 

building construction and access; 

zoning requirements; and 

the environment. 

Our facilities are licensed and
subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants will be subject
to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessary licenses or other
approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. 

Various federal and state labor
laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefit and work
authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of many of our restaurants,
even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employees may not all meet federal
work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. 

Our business can be adversely affected by negative
publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borne illness or other health
concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicity could negatively impact public
perception of our brands. 

We are required to comply
with the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located. Alcoholic
beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for
a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause
at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including
minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage
and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations, our licenses may be revoked and
we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants. 

The Federal Americans with
Disabilities Act (the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.
We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection with the
construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities. 

Failure to comply with
these and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. 

We may face liability under dram shop
statutes. 

Our sale of alcoholic beverages
subjects us to dram shop statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic
beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage, or if we fail to maintain
our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
There are currently no dram shop claims pending against us. See Item 1. Business Government Regulation 
for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply. 

Concerns relating
to pandemics and other diseases, food safety and food-borne illness could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, disrupt our food
supply chain or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on our customer traffic and ability to operate our restaurants and future pandemics
and other diseases may have a similar or more severe impact. 

In years past, several
nationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach, which
is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of mad
cow disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as, hepatitis A,
trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect the price
and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales could decline. 

16 

Instances of food-borne
illnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity about us
or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects
of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers
to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced
to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result
of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, could materially harm our business. 

If we are unable to protect our customers 
credit card data, we could be exposed to data loss, litigation and liability, and our reputation could be significantly harmed. 

In connection with credit card
sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use private networks, third
parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit card
sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access
to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information
or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, and liability, and could seriously disrupt
our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. We have not experienced any security breaches
to date. 

If we experience a significant failure in or
interruption of certain key information technology systems, our business could be adversely impacted. 

We use a variety of applications
and systems to manage the flow of information securely within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure.
The services available within our systems and applications include restaurant and store operations, supply chain, inventory, scheduling,
training, human capital management, financial tools and data protection services. The restaurant and store structure is based primarily
on a point-of-sale system that operates locally and is integrated with other functions necessary to operations. It records sales transactions,
receives out of store orders and authorizes, batches and transmits credit card transactions. The system also allows employees to enter
time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured from this system at each restaurant
or store is collected in the central corporate infrastructure, which enables management to continually monitor operating results. Our
ability to manage efficiently and effectively our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these and other systems
and our operations depend substantially on the availability of our point-of-sale system and related networks and applications. These
systems may be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems, as well as from physical
theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Any failure of these systems to operate effectively,
whether from security breaches, maintenance problems, upgrades or transitions to new platforms, or other factors could result in interruptions
to or delays in our restaurant or other operations, adversely impacting the restaurant or store experience for our customers or negatively
impacting our ability to manage our business. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery
plans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any
losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially
adversely affected. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. 

The effect of changes to U.S. healthcare laws may increase our healthcare
costs and negatively impact our financial results. 

We offer eligible full-time
employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by the Company. For various reasons, many of our eligible employees
currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. The costs and other effects of any new healthcare requirements cannot be
determined with certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results. 

Governmental regulation in one or more
of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including by harming our ability to open new
restaurants or increasing our operating costs. 

Employment
and immigration regulations 

We
are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, including
wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, healthcare, family leave mandates, requirements regarding
working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and
workers compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can
be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuits have been filed
against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We could suffer losses from
and we incur legal costs to defend these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition, several
states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases, paid sick
leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs. Changes in U.S. healthcare
laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant new welfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses. 

17 

We
also are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. From time to time,
the State of Florida considers adopting new state immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time
to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigration
or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make
our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with
government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized
workers. We currently participate in the E-Verify program, an Internet-based, free program run by the U.S. government to
verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guarantee that we will properly
identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience
adverse publicity that negatively affects our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of
a significant number of employees would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse
publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penalties
and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance
laws. Our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors. 

On
the other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate
impact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could be found to be in violation
of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance,
anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified
employees. Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees
for our restaurants. 

Additionally,
while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurant
companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase and our efforts to
maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in labor laws, including the possible
passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees
being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing
requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture. 

Americans
with disabilities act and similar state laws 

We
are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals
with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connection with
ADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning
certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws. The expenses
associated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ADA
or similar state laws, could be material. 

Nutrition
and food regulation 

In
recent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on the
food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments have
been a particular focus. Numerous jurisdictions around the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie
information on their menus and/or make other nutritional information available and U.S. health care reform law included nation-wide nutrition
disclosure requirements. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they select their food
and beverage choices decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customers buying habits in a way that adversely
impacts our sales. 

Privacy/Cybersecurity 

We
are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some
of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and the regulatory
environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and information systems are compromised
or if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could
adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types
of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees. 

18 

Local
licensure, zoning and other regulation 

Each
of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplace
safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new
restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect
to zoning, use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations. 

Environmental
laws 

We
are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal
of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental
review of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future
environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or
to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws. 

We could be
party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money
damages and other remedies. 

We
could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material
money damages and other remedies. We could become subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding
workplace and employment matters, including wages, work hours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination
and similar matters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers
could file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a
visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices.
The restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure
and advertising practices. 

Regardless
of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and
may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materially
and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, whether
directed at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects,
which in turn could adversely affect our results. 

Our success
may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel. 

Our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan, has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002.
August Bucci, Jeffrey Kastner and Christopher O Neil, our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of
Package Operations, respectively, have also served with us since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci, since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastner
and 2016 in the case of Mr. O Neil, and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well. We believe our executive
officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and
that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive
officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision. If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change
in leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our
current strategy, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted. 

We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity. 

Although
we maintain systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology,
there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Any material incidents could cause us to experience
financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us and increased expenses
related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and
are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become
more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take
to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software,
disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate
these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched,
and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. If our information security systems or data are compromised
in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may incur financial losses and we may incur costs to remediate
possible harm and/or to pay fines or take other action which could have a material adverse impact on our business. 

19 

If there is
a material failure in our information technology systems, our business operations and profits could be negatively affected and our systems
may be inadequate to support our future growth strategies. 

We
rely heavily on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations including our restaurant point-of sale systems, financial
systems, marketing programs, employee engagement, supply chain management, cyber-security, and various other processes and transactions.
Our ability to effectively manage and run our business depends on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems,
including technology services and systems for which we contract from third parties. These systems and services may be insufficient to
effectively manage and run our business. These systems and our business needs will continue to evolve and require upgrades and maintenance
over time, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital. 

Moreover,
these technology services and systems, communication systems, and electronic data could be subject or vulnerable to damage or interruption
from hurricanes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, data breaches,
or other attempts to harm our systems. A failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or
replacement systems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure information technology network for any of the above reasons
could result in interruption and delays in customer services, adversely affect our reputation, and negatively impact our results of operations. 

Acts of violence
at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situations and terrorism,
could unfavorably impact our restaurant sales, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

Any
act of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situations
and terrorist activities, may result in restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and, in the
long-term, may cause our customers and staff to avoid our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact customer traffic and
make it more difficult to staff our restaurants fully, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

The
occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, such as active shooter or future terrorist attacks military and governmental responses,
and the protest of future wars, may result in negative changes to economic conditions likely resulting in decreased consumer spending.
Additionally, decreases in consumer discretionary spending may impact the frequency with which our customers choose to dine out at restaurants
or the amount they spend on meals while dining out at restaurants, thereby adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. A
decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefit of planned menu price increases
to help preserve our operating margins. 

Social media
impact on customer perceptions of our brand. 

The
considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated.
The adverse impact of publicity on customers perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales. If the impact
of any such publicity is particularly long-lasting, the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished. 

Our digital
business has become an increasingly significant part of our business. 

Our
revenue derived from digital orders, which includes delivery and customer pickup has increased substantially. We have implemented technology,
targeted advertising and promotions and to some extent remodeled our restaurants, to accommodate the growth of our digital business. If
we do not continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to recoup these costs or achieve our sales growth potential.
We rely on third-party delivery services to fulfill package store delivery orders, and the ordering and payment platforms used by these
third-parties, or online ordering system, could be interrupted by technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks or other factors,
which could adversely impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, our delivery partners are
responsible for order fulfillment and errors or failures to make timely deliveries could cause guests to stop ordering from us. The third-party
delivery business is competitive, with a number of players competing for market share and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery
services that we utilize cease or curtail operations, increase their fees, or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to
our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted. 

20 

Changes in
interest rates. 

As of September 28, 2024, we had
one variable rate instrument outstanding that is impacted by changes in interest rates. The variable rate debt instrument is equal to
the lender s BSBY Screen Rate plus one and one-half percent (1.50 per annum. As a means of managing our interest rate risk on
the debt instrument, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our unrelated third party lender to convert this variable rate
debt obligation to fixed rate. The Bloomberg Index Services Limited announced the permanent cessation of all tenors of BSBY, effective
immediately following the last publication of BSBY on November 15, 2024. As of that date, our lender has determined that a commercially
reasonable and good faith alternative to BSBY is the 1 Month CME Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), plus 10 Basis
Points. 

ITEM 1B 
 UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 

As a Smaller Reporting Company
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations
and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item 1B. 

ITEM 1C 
 CYBERSECURITY 

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy 

We are committed to safeguarding
our information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction. Our program
to protect our information assets and the management of risks to those assets supports the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of the information necessary to our long-term business success. 

Our cybersecurity risk management
program includes: 

the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls, including, third-party network security reviews, scans, and audits, on at least an annual basis; 

regular cybersecurity awareness training for employees
 with access to our information systems, incident response personnel, and senior management; 

a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; 

a disaster recovery plan and controls designed to protect against business interruption, including by backing up our critical systems; 

use of end-to-end encryption and tokenization technology, a public key infrastructure, designed to ensure that only trusted devices can access our enterprise information technology network, and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that scans data in transit to help prevent the execution of harmful code; and 

a third-party risk management process for service

 Lease assigned to franchisee. We are no longer contingently liable on the lease. 

(3) 
 In 1974, we sold and assigned the underlying ground lease to unaffiliated third parties and simultaneously subleased it back. We have re-purchased from the unaffiliated third parties and currently own 56 of the underlying ground lease, as well as the sublease agreement. In April, 2023 we purchased the real property, subject to the ground lease and sublease agreement through which we continue to occupy the premises. As a result, we pay 44 of the rent due under the ground lease and the sublease agreement. 

(4) 
 Effective December 1, 1998, we purchased the Management Agreement to operate the franchised restaurant for the franchisee. 

(5) 
 Ground lease executed by us on September 25, 2001. We constructed a 4,120 square foot building, of which 1,978 square feet is used by us for the operation of a package liquor store and the other 2,142 square feet is subleased to an unaffiliated third party as retail space. The package liquor store opened for business on November 17, 2003.	 

(6) 
 During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012, our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigan s Calusa Center, LLC, closed on the purchase of a two building shopping center in Miami, Florida, which consists of (i) one stand-alone building which is leased to ten unaffiliated third parties and houses our package liquor store #45 (approximately 3,250 square feet) and (ii) a second stand-alone building where our limited partnership owned restaurant located at 12790 SW 88 th Street, Miami, Florida, (Store #70), operates. 

(7) 
 During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2014, we closed on the purchase of the building in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which is leased to our franchisee owned restaurant located at 1479 E. Commercial Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, (Store #15). 

(8) 
 During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), was damaged by a fire and was forced to close. We determined that Store #19 should be demolished and rebuilt as separate buildings. As a result, the package liquor store was closed since our first quarter year 2019, but re-opened for business in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 in a newly constructed stand-alone building #19P. During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2024, we re-opened our restaurant in a stand-alone building on the same site in Hollywood, Florida adjacent to Store #19P. 

(9) 
 During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a lease for this location, which lease was subsequently assigned to a limited partnership. We raised funds to renovate this new location for operation as a Flanigan s restaurant using our limited partnership ownership model, which location opened for business in April 2023. 

(10) 
 During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a lease for this location. This new location opened for business as a Big Daddy s Wine Liquors retail package liquor store in March 2023. 

27 

(11) 
 
 During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023,
 we closed on the purchase of a three building shopping center in Hallandale Beach, Florida adjacent to our combination package store and
 restaurant in Hallandale Beach, Florida (Store #31), which consists of: (A) one stand-alone building which is leased to two unaffiliated
 third party retailers; (B) the second stand-alone building which is leased to one unaffiliated third party retailer; and (C) the third
 stand-alone building which is leased to one unaffiliated third party retailer. 

Re-construction Following Casualty Loss 

During the first quarter of our
fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19)
was damaged by a fire and was forced to close. The package liquor store re-opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal
year 2023 in a newly constructed stand-alone building. The restaurant re-opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year
2024 in a newly constructed stand-alone building where our combination package liquor store and restaurant was previously located. 

Purchase of Real Property; Leasehold / Sub-leasehold
Interests 

El Portal, Florida Big Daddy s
Liquors /Warehouse) 

During the third quarter of our
fiscal year 2023, we closed with a non-affiliated third party on the purchase of the real property it owns located at 8600 Biscayne Boulevard,
El Portal, Florida consisting of approximately 6,000 square feet of commercial space which we sublease and where our Big Daddy s
Liquors package liquor store and our warehouse (Store #47) operate for 3,200,000. We paid all cash at closing. Despite the purchase
of this property, the sublease arrangement remains in place with all investors. 

Hallandale Beach, Florida 

During the third quarter of our
fiscal year 2023, we closed with a non-affiliated third party on the purchase of a three building shopping center in Hallandale Beach,
Florida, which consists of one stand-alone building a portion of which is leased to one unaffiliated third party (approximately 950 square
feet) and a portion of which is occupied by us (approximately 500 square feet); a second stand-alone building which is leased to one unaffiliated
third party (approximately 1,500 square feet); and a third stand-alone building which is leased to one unaffiliated third party (approximately
2,500 square feet) for 8,500,000. The rental income generated by these three lease arrangements is not material. The real property is
located adjacent to our real property located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, Florida, where our combination package store
and restaurant (Store #31) operates. We paid all cash at closing and accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition. 

Purchase of Leasehold/Sub-leasehold Interests 

In 1974, we sold the underlying
ground lease to the real property located at 8600 Biscayne Boulevard, El Portal, Florida to related and unrelated third parties and simultaneously
subleased it back. We operate our retail package liquor store (Store #47) and warehouse from this location. During the first quarter of
our fiscal year 2024, we re-purchased a 4 interest in the underlying ground lease, as well as the sublease agreement from an unrelated
third party for 31,000 and currently own 56 of each lease. As a result, we now only pay 44 of the rent due under the ground lease and
the sublease agreement. 

Subsequent Events 

Subsequent to the end of
our fiscal year 2024, we entered into a new Master Services Agreement with our current vendor for a period of one (1) year effective January
1, 2025, with Company options of four (4) one (1) year renewal options to extend the term of the same. 

Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2024,
for the policy year commencing December 30, 2024, we bound coverage on the following property, general liability, auto, excess liability,
and terrorism policies with premiums totaling approximately 4,014,000 of which property, general liability, excess liability and terrorism
insurance includes coverage for our franchises and our managed restaurant (of approximately 867,000), which are not included in our
consolidated financial statements:

the policy year beginning December 30, 2024, our general liability insurance, excluding limited partnerships, is a one (1) year policy
with our insurance carriers. For the policy commencing December 30, 2024, the self-insured retention per occurrence is 50,000. The one
(1) year general liability insurance premium is in the amount of 479,000;

the policy year beginning December 30, 2024, the general liability insurance for our limited partnerships, including franchisees and the

OVERVIEW 

Financial Information Concerning Industry Segments 

Our business is conducted principally
in two segments: the restaurant segment and the package liquor store segment. Financial information broken into these two principal industry
segments for the two fiscal years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 is set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements
which are attached hereto. 

General 

As of September 28, 2024, we (i)
operated 32 units, consisting of restaurants, sports bar, package liquor stores and combination restaurants/package liquor stores that
we either own or have operational control over and partial ownership in; and (ii) franchises an additional five units, consisting of two
restaurants (one of which we operate) and three combination restaurants/package liquor stores. 

Franchised Units . In exchange
for our providing management and related services to our franchisees and granting them the right to use our service marks "Flanigan's
Seafood Bar and Grill" and "Big Daddy's Liquors", our franchisees (four of which are franchised to members of the family
of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors), are required to (i) pay to us a royalty equal to 1 of gross package liquor
sales and 3 of gross restaurant sales; and (ii) make advertising expenditures equal to between 1.5 to 3 of all gross sales based upon
our actual advertising costs allocated between stores, pro-rata, based upon gross sales. 

Affiliated Limited Partnership
Owned Units . We manage and control the operations of ten of the eleven restaurants owned by limited partnerships, except the Fort
Lauderdale, Florida restaurant which is managed and controlled by a related franchisee. Accordingly, the results of operations of all
limited partnership owned restaurants, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are consolidated with our results of operations
for accounting purposes. The results of operations of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are accounted for by us utilizing the equity
method.

Comparison of Fiscal Years Ended September 28, 2024 and September
30, 2023 

Revenues. Total
revenue for our fiscal year 2024 increased 13,925,000 or 7.98 to 188,321,000 from 174,396,000 for our fiscal year 2023 due primarily
to increased package liquor store and restaurant sales, increased menu prices, revenue generated from the opening of our corporate owned
restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) in March 2024, the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida
(Store #25) and our package liquor stores in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) and Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) for our entire fiscal year
2024 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2023. Effective August 25, 2024, we increased menu prices for our bar offerings to target
an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 5.63 annually to offset higher food and liquor costs. Effective March 26, 2023 we increased
menu prices for our food offerings to target an increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.06 and effective March 20, 2023 we increased
menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 5.65 annually, to offset higher food costs
and higher overall expenses (collectively the Recent Price Increases ). Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu
prices in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022. 

Restaurant Food Sales . 
Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of food, including non-alcoholic beverages, at restaurants totaled 114,795,000 for our fiscal
year 2024 as compared to 107,238,000 for our fiscal year 2023. The increase in restaurant food sales is attributable to the Recent Price
Increases and food sales generated from the opening of corporate owned restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) during the second
quarter of our fiscal year 2024 and the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) for our
entire fiscal year 2024 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2023. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for restaurants open for
all of our fiscal years 2024 and 2023, which consists of ten restaurants owned by us (excluding our Hollywood, Florida location (Store
#19R) which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2024) and nine restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships,
(excluding our Miramar, Florida location (Store #25) which opened for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023) was 1,987,000
and 1,967,000 for our fiscal years 2024 and 2023 respectively, an increase of 1.02 . Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for Company-owned
restaurants only (excluding our Hollywood, Florida location (Store #19R) which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal
year 2024) was 938,000 and 923,000 for our fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 1.63 . Comparable weekly restaurant
food sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only, (excluding our Miramar, Florida location (Store #25) which opened
for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023), was 1,049,000 and 1,044,000 for our fiscal years 2024 and 2023 respectively,
an increase of 0.48 . We expect that restaurant food sales, including non-alcoholic beverages, for our fiscal year 2025 will increase
due to increased restaurant traffic and the operation of our Company-owned Store #19R for our entire fiscal year 2025. 

Restaurant Bar Sales .
 Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants totaled 30,010,000 for our fiscal year 2024 as compared
to 29,000,000 for our fiscal year 2023. The increase in restaurant bar sales is attributable to the Recent Price Increases and food sales
generated from the opening of corporate owned restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) during the second quarter of our fiscal year
2024 and the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) for our entire fiscal year 2024 as
opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2023. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for restaurants open for all of our fiscal years 2024
and 2023 respectively, which consists of ten restaurants owned by us (excluding our Hollywood, Florida location (Store #19R) which opened
for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2024) and nine restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships, (excluding
our Miramar, Florida location (Store #25), which opened for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023) was 526,000 for
our fiscal year 2024 and 539,000 for our fiscal year 2023, a decrease of 2.41 . Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for Company-owned
restaurants only (excluding our Hollywood, Florida location (Store #19R) which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal
year 2024) was 234,000 and 231,000 for our fiscal years 2024 and 2023 respectively, an increase of 1.30 . Comparable weekly restaurant
bar sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only (excluding our Miramar, Florida location (Store #25) which opened
for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023) was 292,000 and 307,000 for our fiscal years 2024 and 2023 respectively,
a decrease of 4.89 . We expect that restaurant bar sales for our fiscal year 2025 will increase due to the operation of our Company-owned
Store #19R for our entire fiscal year 2025. 

Package Liquor Store Sales .
Revenue generated from sales of liquor and related items at package liquor stores totaled 40,497,000 for our fiscal year 2024 as compared
to 35,187,000 for our fiscal year 2023, an increase of 5,310,000. This increase was primarily due to increased package liquor store
traffic and the package liquor sales generated from the operation of our package liquor stores in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) and
Miramar, Florida (Store #24), for our entire fiscal year 2024 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2023. The weekly average of same
store package liquor store sales, which includes nine (9) Company-owned package liquor stores, (excluding Store #19P which reopened during
the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, and Store #24 which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2023), was
 674,000 and 631,000 for our fiscal years 2024 and 2023 respectively, an increase of 6.81 . We expect that package liquor store sales
for our fiscal year 2025 will increase due to increased package liquor store traffic. 

32 

Costs and Expenses .
Costs and expenses (consisting of cost of merchandise sold, payroll and related costs, operating expenses, occupancy costs, selling, general
and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization), for our fiscal year 2024 increased 14,553,000 or 8.70 to 181,925,000
from 167,372,000 for our fiscal year 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased payroll, increased consultant fees to improve
our accounting process, an expected general increase in food costs, costs and expenses incurred from the opening of our Company-owned
restaurant in Hollywood Florida (Store #19R) in March 2024, the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida
(Store #25), and our package liquor stores in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) and Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P), for our entire fiscal
year 2024 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2023, partially offset by actions taken by management to reduce and/or control costs.
We anticipate that our operating costs and expenses will continue to increase through our fiscal year 2025. Operating costs and expenses
increased as a percentage of total revenue to approximately 96.60 in our fiscal year 2024 from 95.97 in our fiscal year 2023. 

Gross Profit .
Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of merchandise sold from sales. 

Restaurant Food and
Bar Sales . Gross profit for food and bar sales for our fiscal year 2024 increased to 94,943,000 from 90,750,000 for our fiscal
year 2023. Gross profit margin for the restaurant food and bar sales decreased during our fiscal year 2024 when compared to our fiscal
year 2023 due to higher food costs partially offset by, among other things, the Recent Price Increases. Our gross profit margin for restaurant
food and bar sales (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of restaurant food and bar sales), was 65.57 for our fiscal
year 2024 and 66.61 for our fiscal year 2023. 

Package Store Sales .
Gross profit for package store sales for our fiscal year 2024 increased to 10,369,000 from 9,377,000 for our fiscal year 2023. Our gross
profit margin, (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of package liquor store sales), for package store sales was 25.60 
for our fiscal year 2024 and 26.65 for our fiscal year 2023. We anticipate that the gross profit margin for package liquor store merchandise
will decrease for our fiscal year 2025 due to higher costs and a reduction in pricing of certain package store merchandise to be more
competitive. 

Payroll and Related
Costs . Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2024 increased 2,742,000 or 4.84 to 59,349,000 from 56,607,000 for our
fiscal year 2023. Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2024 were higher due primarily to the opening of our corporate owned restaurant
in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) in March 2024, the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store
#25) and our package liquor stores in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) and Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) for our entire fiscal year 2024
as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2023 and the increase to the Florida minimum wage. Payroll and related costs as a percentage of
total revenue was 31.51 for our fiscal year 2024 and 32.46 of total revenue for our fiscal year 2023. 

Operating Expenses .
Operating expenses (including but not limited to utilities, insurance, cleaning, credit card fees, supplies, security, and other costs
closely related to running restaurant and package operations) for our fiscal year 2024 increased 1,234,000 or 5.22 to 24,892,000 from
 23,658,000 for our fiscal year 2023 due primarily to the opening of our corporate owned restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R)
in March 2024, the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) and our package liquor stores
in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) and Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) for our entire fiscal year 2024 as opposed to a part of our fiscal
year 2023, inflation and otherwise due to increases in expenses across all categories. 

Occupancy Costs .
Occupancy costs (consisting of percentage rent, common area maintenance, repairs, real property taxes, amortization of leasehold purchases
and rent expense associated with operating lease liabilities under ASC 842) for our fiscal year 2024 increased 520,000 or 6.87 to 8,086,000
from 7,566,000 for our fiscal year 2023. The increase in occupancy costs was primarily due to an increase in real property taxes. 

Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses (consisting of general corporate expenses, including
but not limited to advertising, professional costs, clerical and administrative overhead) for our fiscal year 2024 increased 658,000
or 14.05 to 5,340,000 from 4,682,000 for our fiscal year 2023 due primarily to increased consultant fees to improve our accounting
process and otherwise to increases in expenses across all categories. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage
of total revenue for our fiscal year 2024 to 2.84 as compared to 2.68 for our fiscal year 2023. 

Depreciation and Amortization.
 Depreciation and amortization expense for our fiscal year 2024 increased 707,000 or 19.85 to 4,268,000 from 3,561,000 for
our fiscal year 2023. This increase is driven by the opening of our corporate owned restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) in
March 2024, the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) and our package liquor stores in
Miramar, Florida (Store #24) and Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) for our entire fiscal year 2024 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year
2023. Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a percentage of total revenue for our fiscal year 2024 to 2.27 as compared
to 2.04 for our fiscal year 2023. 

Interest Expense,
Net . Interest expense, net, for our fiscal year 2024 decreased 48,000 to 1,019,000 from 1,067,000 for our fiscal year 2023. 

Income Taxes. Income
tax for our fiscal year 2024 was an expense of 286,000, as compared to an expense of 649,000 for our fiscal year 2023. Income taxes
as a percentage of income before provision for our fiscal year 2024 is 5.12 as compared to 10.70 in our fiscal year 2023. 

33 

Net Income. Net
income for our fiscal year 2024 decreased 116,000 or 2.14 to 5,300,000 from 5,416,000 for our fiscal year 2023 due primarily to higher
food costs and overall increased expenses, including but not limited to, increased consultant fees to improve our accounting process.
As a percentage of total revenue, net income for our fiscal year 2024 is 2.81 , as compared to 3.11 for our fiscal year 2023. 

Net Income Attributable
to Flanigan s Enterprise, Inc. s Stockholders. Net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2024 decreased
 643,000 or 16.08 to 3,356,000 from 3,999,000 for our fiscal year 2023 due primarily to higher food costs and overall increased expenses,
including but not limited to, increased consultant fees to improve our accounting process and a higher portion of our net income attributable
to noncontrolling interests (specifically the operation of our Miramar location for our entire fiscal year 2024 as opposed to a part
of our fiscal year 2023). As a percentage of revenue, net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2024 is 1.78 , as compared
to 2.29 for our fiscal year 2023. 

New Limited Partnership Restaurants 

As new limited partnership restaurants
open, our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to advance pre-opening costs, including but not limited
to pre-opening rent for the new limited partnership locations. During our fiscal year 2024 we did not open any new limited partnership
restaurants, nor did we have any in the development stage. During our fiscal year 2023, we opened one new limited partnership restaurant
location in Miramar, Florida as a Flanigan s . 

Menu Price Increases 

During our fiscal year 2024, we
increased menu prices for our bar offerings (effective August 25, 2024) to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 5.63 
annually to offset higher food and liquor costs and higher overall expenses. During our fiscal year 2023, we increased menu prices for
our food offerings (effective March 26, 2023) to target an aggregate increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.06 annually and
we increased menu prices for our bar offerings (effective March 20, 2023) to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 5.65 
annually to offset higher food and liquor costs and higher overall expenses. Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices
in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2024, we increased our menu prices for our bar
offerings (effective December 4, 2024) to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 4.90 annually and we increased our
menu prices for our food offerings (effective November 17, 2024) to target an increase to our food revenues of approximately 4.14 annually
to offset higher food and liquor costs and higher overall expenses. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

We fund our operations through
cash from operations and borrowings from third parties. As of September 28, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 21,402,000,
a decrease of 4,130,000 from our cash balance of 25,532,000 as of September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the completion
of the construction of our Store #19R 2,106,000). 

Inflation is affecting all aspects
of our operations, including but not limited to food, beverage, fuel and labor costs. Inflation is having a material impact on our operating
results. 

We believe that our current cash
availability from our cash on hand, positive cash flow from operations and borrowed funds will be sufficient to fund our operations and
planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.

Capital Expenditures 

In addition to using cash for
our operating expenses, we use cash generated from operations and borrowings to fund the development and construction of new restaurants
and to fund capitalized property improvements for our existing restaurants. During the fiscal year 2024, we acquired property and equipment
and construction in progress of 6,047,000, (of which 289,000 was purchase deposits transferred to property and equipment, 715,000 was
purchase deposits transferred to CIP, and 4,000 was property and equipment in accounts payable), including 528,000 for renovations to
three (3) Company-owned restaurants and 135,000 for one (1) limited partnership owned restaurant. During the fiscal year 2023, we acquired
property and equipment and construction in progress of 20,574,000, (including non-cash items which include 2,390,000 of purchase deposits
transferred to property and equipment and 545,000 of purchase deposits transferred to construction in progress and 931,000 of construction
in progress in accounts payable) including 367,000 for renovations to three (3) existing limited partnership owned restaurants and 378,000
for renovations to three (3) Company-owned restaurants. 

Debt 

As of September 28, 2024, we had
long term debt (including the current portion) of 21,912,000, as compared to 23,128,000 as of September 30, 2023. 

In February 2023, we determined
that as of December 31, 2022, we did not meet the required Post-Distribution Basic Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the Post-Distribution/Fixed
Charge Covenant contained in each of our six (6) loans (the Institutional Loans with our unrelated third party
institutional lender (the Institutional Lender ). On February 23, 2023, we received from the Institutional Lender, a written
waiver of the non-compliance with the Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant (the Covenant Non-Compliance ), pursuant to
which, among other things, the Institutional Lender waived (1) the non-compliance as of December 31, 2022 and (2) their right to exercise
certain remedies under the Institutional Loans, including the right to accelerate the indebtedness owed by us thereunder, resulting in
the indebtedness under the Institutional Loans to be immediately due and payable, which would have had a material adverse effect on the
Company. The Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant requires we maintain a ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 and for the twelve (12) months
ended September 28, 2024 our ratio was calculated to be 1.62 to 1.00. As a result, our classification of debt is appropriate as of September
28, 2024. 

We repaid long term debt, including
auto loans and mortgages in the amount of 1,251,000 and 2,299,000 in our fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Construction Contracts 

(a) 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida
(Store #19 Flanigan s 

During the first quarter of our
fiscal year 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor to re-build our restaurant located at
2505 N. University Drive, Building B, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R), which had been closed since October 2, 2018 due to damage caused
by a fire and re-opened March 26, 2024. The contract totaled 2,515,000 and through our fiscal year 2024 we agreed to change orders increasing
the total contract price by 1,512,000 to 4,027,000, of which 3,905,000 has been paid through September 28, 2024. Subsequent to the
end of our fiscal year 2024, we agreed to final change orders increasing the total contract price by 3,000 to 4,030,000 and the balance
of the contract price of 125,000 has been paid subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2024. 

Purchase Commitments/Supply 

In order to fix the cost
and ensure adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants for calendar year 2025, we entered into a purchase agreement with a
new rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately 7.8 million of 2.5 Down Baby Back Ribs (weight range
in which baby back ribs are sold) during calendar year 2025, at a prescribed cost, which we believe is competitive. For calendar year
2024, we entered into a purchase agreement with our current rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately 7.0 million of
 2.25 Down Baby Back Ribs during calendar year 2024, at a prescribed cost, which we also believe is competitive. The
increase in our cost of baby back ribs for calendar year 2025 compared to calendar year 2024 is due to our purchase of larger sized baby
back ribs and the purchase of baby back ribs for Store #19R, Hollywood, Florida for the entire calendar year, offset by a decrease in
market price. 

While we anticipate purchasing
all of our rib supply from this vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed. 

35 

Flanigan s Fish Company, LLC 

As of September 28, 2024, Flanigan s
Fish Company, LLC, a Florida limited liability company FFC ), supplies certain fish to all of our restaurants. Since we
hold the controlling interest in FFC, the balance sheet and operating results of this entity are consolidated into the accompanying consolidated
financial statements of the Company. Sales and purchases of fish are recognized in restaurant food sales and restaurant (cost of merchandise
sold), respectively, in the consolidated statements of income at the time of sale to the restaurant. In addition, the 49 of FFC owned
by the unrelated third party is recognized as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements.

 12,923 

While there can be no assurance
due to, among other things, unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues, or both, we believe that our cash on hand and
positive cash flow from operations will adequately fund operations, debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout our fiscal
year 2025. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have off-balance sheet
arrangements. 

Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements 

Adopted 

The FASB issued guidance, Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,
which provides a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected
to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial
asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The measurement of expected
credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable
and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This guidance was effective for the Company in the first
quarter of our fiscal year 2024; however, after performing a thorough analysis the Company concluded there was no material impact from
the adoption of this ASU. 

In November 2023, the FASB issued
ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which updates reportable segment
disclosure requirements, primarily through requiring enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess
segment performance. We early adopted this ASU in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2024 and this ASU affected the expense presentation
of our Consolidated Statements of Income and our Business Segments footnote. For further information regarding the Company s Business
Segments, please refer to our Consolidated Statements of Income and Business Segments footnote. 

Recently Issued 

In December 2023, the FASB issued
ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires enhanced income tax disclosures,
primarily related to standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This
ASU will be effective for the Company in our fiscal year 2026, with the guidance applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Early
adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the new accounting guidance will have on our tax disclosures. 

There are no other recently
issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we believe will have a material effect on our financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies
are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the
related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation
of our consolidated financial statements: 

Estimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment 

The estimates of useful lives
for property and equipment are significant estimates. Expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is
first constructed are material. In addition, periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material. We estimate the
useful life of those assets by considering, among other things, expected use, life of the lease on the building, and warranty period,
if applicable. The assets are then depreciated using a straight-line method over those estimated lives. These estimated lives are reviewed
periodically and adjusted if necessary. Any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period
in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. 

Consolidation of Limited Partnerships 

As of September 28, 2024, we operate
ten (10) restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants. We expect that any expansion
which takes place in opening new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner. In addition to the general
partnership interest we also purchased limited partnership units ranging from 0 to 49 of the total units outstanding. As a result of
these controlling interests, we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own
in excess of 50 of the equity interests. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The non-controlling interests
in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share. 

Income Taxes 

We account for our income taxes
using FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes , which requires among other things, recognition of future tax benefits measured
at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities
and tax credits to the extent that realization of said tax benefits is more likely than not. For discussion regarding our carryforwards
refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year 2024. 

Leases 

Under Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 842, Leases ASC 842 ), lease arrangements must be presented on the lessee s balance sheet by recording a right-of-use
asset and a lease liability equal to the present value of the related future minimum lease payments. We adopted the standard in the first
quarter of our fiscal 2020, using the modified retrospective approach. Estimates associated with leases include lease classification,
discount rate and lease term. 

Loyalty Programs 

We offer loyalty programs to customers
of our restaurants and package liquor stores. The gift cards distributed as a part of our loyalty programs have expiration dates and we
estimate breakage for such gift cards. 

Other Matters 

Impact of Inflation 

The primary inflationary factors affecting our
operations are food, beverage and labor costs. A large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum
wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs. Inflation is having a material impact on our operating results, especially
rising food, fuel and labor costs. 

ITEM 7A. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As part of our ongoing operations,
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings. As described in Note 13 Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage these risks. These instruments
are not used for speculative purposes but are used to modify variable rate obligations into fixed rate obligations. 

37 

At the end of our fiscal year
2024, we had approximately 1,449,000 in 90-day certificates of deposit, government guaranteed and at fixed annual interest rates between
4.65 -5.45 . Otherwise, as of September 28, 2024, our cash resources offset our bank charges and any excess cash resources earn interest
at variable rates. Accordingly, our return on these funds is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. 

There is no assurance that interest
rates will increase or decrease over our next fiscal year or that an increase will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA .

ITEM 9. 
 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES. 

None. 

ITEM 9A. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES . 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of September 28, 2024, an evaluation
was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 28, 2024. 

Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the course of our independent
registered public accounting firm performing its quarterly review procedures in connection with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements to be included in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of our 2023 fiscal year, we became aware of certain errors made by management
in recording certain transactions and in performing debt covenant calculations, which constituted material weaknesses in our internal
controls. As a result of this finding, during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2023, we began the process of addressing these material
weaknesses by bolstering our internal controls over the review of certain financial transactions and their impact on our interim and annual
financial statements, as well as our review of the debt covenant calculations. During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2024 the additional
controls had been implemented and evaluated by management and determined to be operating effectively and as a result of our findings,
as of the end of the second quarter of our fiscal year 2024, we have concluded that our previously listed material weaknesses had been
remediated. 

Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting 

A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our interim or annual financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Information technology general
controls (ITGCs) were not designed and implemented effectively to ensure (i) that access to applications and data, and the ability to
make program and database changes, were adequately restricted to appropriate personnel and (ii) that database changes were logged completely
and accurately. Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective
because they could have been adversely impacted. 

The material weaknesses identified
above did not result in any material misstatements in our financial statements or disclosures, and there were no changes to previously
released financial results. However, as a result of this finding, during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2025, we began the process
of addressing these material weaknesses to our ITGCs. 

38 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Apart from the changes discussed
above we have not made any additional changes to our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Management s Assessment on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
This evaluation was based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission in 2013 COSO ). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that as of September 28, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
and Permitted Omission from Management s Assessment 

Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal controls can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

This annual report does not include
an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s
report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us
to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 

Flanigan s Enterprises, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Flanigan s Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023,
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended September 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In
our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September
28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September
28, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

Back Ribs during calendar year 2024, at a prescribed cost, which we also believe is competitive. The increase in our cost of baby
back ribs for calendar year 2025 compared to calendar year 2024 is due to our purchase of larger sized baby back ribs and the purchase

variable rate instrument
outstanding that is impacted by changes in interest rates. The interest rate of our variable rate debt instrument is equal to the lender s
BSBY Screen Rate plus and one-half percent per annum. In September 2022, we refinanced the mortgage loan encumbering the property
where our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, Florida, (Store #31) operates,
which mortgage loan is held by an unaffiliated third party lender (the M Loan ). Effective November 15, 2024, the publication
of BSBY was terminated and as of such date, the variable rate of interest under our debt instrument is equal to the lender s 1 Month
CME Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), plus 10 basis points, as an equivalent alternative approved by the lender. 

As a means of managing our interest rate risk on this
debt instrument, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our unrelated third-party lender to convert this variable rate debt
obligation to a fixed rate. We are currently party to the following interest rate swap agreement: 

(i) The interest rate swap agreement entered into
in September 2022 relates to the M Loan (the M Term Loan Swap ). The M Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest
for a fifteen ) year period at a fixed rate of on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of , while receiving
interest for the same period at , on the same amortizing notional principal amount. Due to
the change in the interest rate on the M Loan, on November 22, 2024, we terminated the M Term Loan Swap and simultaneously entered
into a new interest rate swap agreement for , the balance due on the M Loan, which requires us to pay interest for twelve
(12) years, ten (10) months, which is the balance of the original fifteen year period at a fixed rate of on an initial amortizing
notional principal amount of , while receiving interest for the same period at the lender s 1 Month CME Term Secured Overnight
Financing Rate SOFR ), plus 10 basis points, at the same amortizing notional principal amount. We determined that the interest
rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and changes in fair value are adjusted quarterly. 

 shares of our common
stock under the discretionary plan approved by the Board of Directors on May 17, 2007. Our current repurchase plan has no expiration

conditions, up to a purchase price of price of per share. The Internal Revenue Service imposes a tax on stock repurchases after
December 31, 2022 over within a fiscal year. 

reportable segments 
package stores and restaurants. The operation of package stores consists of retail liquor sales and related items. The operation of restaurants
consists of restaurant food and bar sales. Operating income is total revenue less cost of merchandise sold and operating expenses relative
to each segment. In order to evaluate each of these operating segments we also break out our Corporate entity which functions as a
cost center accumulating expenses that do not directly relate to the reportable segments operations. As such, our Chief Operating Decision
Maker (CODM) (our Chief Financial Officer) ensures that these expenses are separated in order to properly evaluate the main reportable
segments as presented below. We have disclosed for each reportable segment the significant expense categories that are reviewed by CODM
in the tables below and there are no additional significant expenses within the expense categories presented. The key areas of focus by
CODM for allocation of resources are revenues from each reportable segment, as well as their cost of merchandise sold, payroll related
costs, and operating expenses (these figures are presented both pre-elimination and post-elimination with a line clearly distinguishing
the elimination amounts). While CODM analyzes these categories, the area of focus is period over period fluxes to determine that the right
allocation of resources is attributed to each segment in order to ensure profitability is maximized. Gross profit is not shown on the
Consolidated Statements of Income but is a metric that CODM uses to assess segment performance and as such is included in the tables below.
In computing operating income, none of the following items have been included: interest expense, other non-operating income and expenses
and income taxes. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets that are used in our operations in each segment. Corporate assets are
principally cash and real property, improvements, furniture, equipment and vehicles used at our corporate headquarters. We do not have
any operations outside of the United States and transactions between restaurants and package liquor stores are not material. The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. CODM analyzes each segment s
income from operations for making decisions regarding resource allocation. reportable segments in which we operate,
are shown in the following tables.

3. Corporate officers; 

4. Any employee with access to the Company s consolidated financial results while it is nonpublic information;

III. FORMS 

 None 

IV. DEFINITIONS 

A. Insider Trading : Purchases or sales of Company securities while aware of or in possession
of material nonpublic information concerning the Company or tipping or disclosing material nonpublic information to others who might trade
on the basis of that information. 

B. Material Information : Information should be regarded as material if there is a substantial
likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important when deciding to buy, hold or sell a security. Any information that
could reasonably affect the price of the security is material. Any such information, whether it is positive or negative, favorable or
unfavorable, should be considered material. There is no bright-line test for assessing materiality; rather, materiality is based on an
assessment of all the facts and circumstances. 

 There are various categories of nonpublic
information that are particularly sensitive and, generally, should always be presumed to be material. Examples of such nonpublic information
include, but are not limited to: 

1. Actual financial results prior to public release; 

2. Earnings guidance, outlook, sales or profit projections, or changes thereto; 

3. Significant acquisitions, dispositions, mergers or transactions; 

4. Significant business developments, such as restructurings, large contracts or product developments; 

5. Bank borrowings, financing transactions or liquidity issues outside the Company s ordinary course
of business; 

6. Events regarding the Company s securities (such as repurchase plans, stock splits, significant increases
or decreases in dividends, changes to the rights of shareholders, or public or private sales of new equity or debt securities); 

7. Significant pending or threatened government investigations or significant litigation; 

8. A significant cybersecurity incident, such as a data breach, or any other significant disruption in the
Company s operations or loss, potential loss, breach or unauthorized access of its property or assets, whether at its facilities
or through its information technology infrastructure; 

9. Key management changes; and 

10. A change in auditors or notification that an auditor s reports may no longer be relied upon. 

 In evaluating whether any information
is material, please remember that someone else (including the SEC) will be viewing a securities transaction made by you with the benefit
of 20/20 hindsight. If in doubt, you should assume that the information is material or consult the Company s legal
counsel. 

C. Nonpublic Information : Nonpublic information is generally considered to be information that
has not been previously disclosed or made available to the general public. You should presume that information is nonpublic unless it
has been widely disseminated (i.e., you can point to its official release or disclosure by the Company in a press release, an SEC filing,
or other widely available source of information such as a pre-announced earnings conference call or investor conference that is available
by webcast on the Company s website). 

 Information would not be widely disseminated
if it is available only to the Company s employees. Information is not necessarily public merely because it has been discussed in
the press, which will sometimes report rumors, or because it has been covered in a speech to an audience, an interview, a website posting,
or an article in a magazine. 

 Once information is widely disseminated,
it is still necessary to afford the investing public with sufficient time to absorb and react to the information. Information will generally
be considered to be fully absorbed one complete business day after the information is released. 

V. RESPONSIBILITY 

A. Prohibition on Trading While Aware of Material Nonpublic Information and Tipping : No Covered
Person may, while he or she is aware of or in possession of any material nonpublic information relating to the Company, directly or indirectly,

2. Recommend the purchase or sale of any Company securities; or 

3. Disclose material nonpublic information to any person if it is reasonably foreseeable that such person

make Related Parties aware of the need to confer with the Covered Person before they trade in Company securities, and a Covered Person
should treat all such transactions for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if the transactions were for the
account of the Covered Person. 

B. Applicability To Other Companies : This Policy also applies to purchases or sales of securities
or the disclosure of material nonpublic information relating to any other company (including customers, suppliers, business partners and

C. Tender Offers : A Covered Person is prohibited from trading in securities in connection with

3. Transfers of shares from a transfer agent account or brokerage account to an identically titled brokerage
account with identical share ownership rights; 

4. Purchases or sales made pursuant to a Trading Plan that satisfies the requirements of the
Section titled Rule 10B5-1 Trading Plans (below); and 

5. Purchases of securities from the Company or sales of securities to the Company.

in Company securities during a period in which he or she would otherwise be prohibited from trading by this Policy. A Trading Plan may
only be adopted and put in place outside of a blackout period and when the adopting person is not in possession or aware of material nonpublic
information. 

VI. BLACKOUT PERIODS AND PRECLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS 

A. Earnings Blackouts : No person covered by Section II, item C may engage in transactions
involving Company securities during the following time periods (each, an Earnings Blackout Period ): 

1. The period beginning at the close of the market on the last day of each fiscal quarter and ending at the
close of business on the first complete business day after the filing of the Company s earnings release for that quarter or fiscal
year (typically up to 45 days after quarter end and up to 120 days after fiscal year end). Earnings releases appear on the Company s
website, https://www.flanigans.net/investors/, Investors , Financial Releases or 

2. During such other periods as may be established from time to time by the Board, the Chief Executive Officer
or the Chief Financial Officer considering events or developments affecting the Company. 

 When deemed necessary or appropriate,
senior management may begin the Earnings Blackout Period earlier, extend it, apply it to a different group of persons or otherwise modify
it. In addition, no person covered by Section II, SCOPE item C shall inform a person not covered by Section VI that a
blackout period imposed because of events or developments is in effect. 

B. Event Specific Blackout Periods : From time to time, an event may occur that is material
to the Company and is known only by certain persons. Senior management may in such instance notify such persons that so long as the event
remains material and non-public, such persons may not trade Company securities. The existence of an event-specific blackout period or
an early beginning to the blackout period will not be announced to the Company as a whole and should not be communicated to any other
person. 

C. Preclearance To Trade, Gift Or Transfer : Directors, executive officers, corporate officers
and all other officers covered by earnings blackouts that wish to trade, gift (including, for example, charitable donations and gifts
to family members) or otherwise transfer Company securities outside the blackout period must also obtain the advance permission (in writing/e-mail)
of the Company s CFO and CEO. Approval by both the CFO and the CEO is required. 

 Before requesting pre-clearance, the
requestor must carefully consider whether he or she may be in possession or aware of material nonpublic information about the Company.
If a pre-clearance request is denied, the requestor must refrain from initiating any transaction in Company securities, and not inform
any other person of the denial. Transactions that are pre-cleared must be effected within three business days of receipt of pre-clearance
and, in all cases, prior to the beginning of the next blackout period, unless an exception is granted. If not effected within this time
period, the transactions must be re-submitted for pre-clearance. 

 Even if you receive pre-clearance and
it is outside a blackout period, the general prohibition against trading and disclosing still applies if you are aware of or in possession
of material nonpublic information. The blackout policy and preclearance procedures are in addition to the general Insider Trading prohibitions
and are not a substitute therefor. 

VII. PREVENTION OF INSIDER TRADING BY OTHERS 

 The Company, its directors
and officers and some supervisory personnel could be deemed controlling persons subject to potential liability under the
securities laws. Accordingly, it is incumbent on these persons to maintain an awareness of possible Insider Trading violations by persons
under their control and to take measures where appropriate to prevent such violations. Directors, officers and other supervisory personnel
who become aware of a potential Insider Trading violation or a violation of this policy should immediately advise senior management and
should take steps where appropriate to prevent persons under their supervision from using inside information for trading purposes. 

VIII. ADDITIONAL PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS 

A. Pledging : Directors and elected corporate officers must comply with the Company s
Share Pledging Policy, which generally prohibits pledging shares of the Company s common stock as collateral for loans. No Covered
Person may purchase the Company s securities on margin or pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan. If any
person becomes subject to this Policy at a time when he or she has Company securities pledged as collateral for a loan, the pledge must
be released within one year. 

B. Hedging : Directors and executive officers (for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act)
must comply with the Company s hedging policy, which generally prohibits engaging in transactions to hedge or offset value declines
in the value of our stock such as short selling (i.e., selling securities that are not owned by the seller), put or call options, forward
sale or purchase contracts, equity swaps and exchange funds. Covered Persons also may not engage in transactions that hedge or offset
declines in value Company securities such as put or call options, or transactions in derivative securities.

short sales against the box . 

D. Short-Term Trading : Directors and executive officers of the Company are prohibited from

IX. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS 

 Directors and executive officers of the Company
are reminded of their obligations to comply with other requirements in respect of transactions in Company securities, including: 

A. Compliance with Rule 144, including the filing of a Form 144 before selling a limited amount of Company
common stock in an open market sale pursuant to an ordinary brokerage transaction, and the use of a knowledgeable broker; 

B. Immediate post-transaction notification of sufficient detail of any transaction to facilitate the timely

EXHIBIT 97.1 

 FLANIGAN'S ENTERPRISES INC. 

 COMPENSATION CLAWBACK POLICY 

1. Purpose 

 Flanigan's Enterprises
Inc. (the Company is committed to fostering accountability, ethical conduct, and alignment of executive compensation
with long-term performance. The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board has therefore adopted this policy which
establishes procedures for recovering erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation from current and former executive officers of the
Company in the event of a financial restatement caused by material noncompliance with securities laws (the Policy ). 

 This Policy is designed
to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act and Rule 811 of the NYSE American
Company Guide (the Clawback Listing Standards ). 

2. Administration 

 This Policy shall be administered
by the Board. Any determinations made by the Board shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. 

3. Scope 

 This Policy applies to: 

a. Covered Executives : Current and former executive officers of the Company as determined by the Board
in accordance with the definition of Section 10D of the Exchange Act. 

b. Covered Compensation : Incentive-based compensation awarded, earned, or vested based wholly or in
part on financial metrics during the three (3) fiscal years preceding the date the Company determines a restatement is required. 

4. Triggering Event for Recovery 

 Recovery will be initiated
if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its previously issued financial statements due to material noncompliance
with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in
previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements or that would result in a material
misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. Restatements resulting solely
from changes in accounting principles or regulatory guidance are excluded. 

5. Recovery Amount 

 The Company will recover
the amount of incentive-based compensation that exceeds what the executive officer would have received if the Company statements had been
correctly stated, and will be computed without regard to any taxes paid. This calculation will exclude amounts unrelated to misstated
performance metrics. 

For incentive-based compensation
based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical
recalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement, the amount will be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect
of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the incentive-based compensation was received;
and the Company will maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to NYSE American. 

6. No-Fault Standard 

 Recovery applies irrespective
of whether the executive officer was at fault or involved in the financial misstatement. 

7. Methods of Recovery 

 The Board will determine,
in its sole discretion, the method for recovering incentive compensation hereunder which may include, without limitation: 

(a) requiring reimbursement of cash incentive compensation previously paid; and/or 

(b) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board. 

8. No Indemnification 

 The Company shall not indemnify any Covered
Executives officers against the loss of any incorrectly awarded incentive compensation. 

9. Disclosure 

 The Company will disclose instances of clawbacks
as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules in filings such as the annual proxy statement and Form 10-K. 

10. Interpretation 

 The Board is authorized
to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this
Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange
Act, any applicable rules or standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Clawback Listing Standards. 

11. Effective Date 

 This Policy became effective as of December
1, 2023 (the Effective Date and applies to incentive-based compensation granted on or after this date, even if such
incentive compensation was approved, awarded, or granted to Covered Executives prior to the Effective Date. 

12. Amendment; Termination 

 The Board may amend this
Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect final regulations adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with the Clawback Listing Standards and any other
rules or standards adopted by the NYSE American. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time. 

13. Other Recovery Rights 

 Any right of recovery
under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company
pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal
remedies available to the Company. 

14. Relationship to Other Plans and Agreements 

 The Board intends that
this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement,
or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require
a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Policy and
the terms of any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement under which incentive compensation has been granted,
awarded, earned or paid to a Covered Executive, whether or not deferred, the terms of the Policy shall govern. 

15. Acknowledgment. 

 Each Covered Executive
shall sign an acknowledgment form in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A in which they acknowledge that they have read
and understand the terms of the Policy and are bound by the Policy. 

16. Impracticability 

 The Board shall recover
any excess incentive compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such recovery would be impracticable, as determined by the Board
in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and the listing standards of NYSE American. 

17. Successors 

 This Policy shall be binding
and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.
