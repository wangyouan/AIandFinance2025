Description
of Business 

Birdie
Win Corporation is headquartered in Hong Kong. We provide financial literacy seminar services to Malaysian and Hong Kong individuals
and families. Our mission is to improve the financial well-being of our clients. 

The
Company believes there is enormous opportunity in promoting, and at the same time profiting from financial literacy in Hong Kong and
Malaysia. At present, the only service that has been provided by the Company is the one-on-one Personal Financial Literacy Seminar (herein
referred as PFL Seminar ). All other additional services are prospective, and have not, as of this point in time, been performed
for any clients yet. We believe that we have the capacity to offer the services immediately upon securing an agreement with a client. 

Our
PFL Seminar focuses on elevating our clients financial literacy and teaching them responsible financial behaviors and rational
attitudes towards financial management. Our PFL Seminar aims to improve clients awareness and capability to make rational financial
decision throughout their life stages, which leads to sustained improvements in their financial behavior. We believe that raising financial
literacy is a key to empower clients with the financial knowledge and skills to improve their financial well-being. Financially capable
clients could interact responsibly with their financial service providers, which in turn builds a healthy financial lifestyle. At present,
our PFL Seminar is taught solely by the Company s President. We intend to hire additional instructors in the future, depending
on the success of our operations, and will require that all instructors have relevant training/background and that the follow a standard
of procedure (SOP), that has yet to be developed, in order to ensure that their lessons meet the quality standards we require. 

Our
PFL Seminar is a one-on-one workshop, presently conducted online via Zoom, which consists of four sessions and the clients are expected
to devote at least three hours per session as elaborated below: 

Session
1: Financial Management Knowledge, Tool and Resources 

Session
1 of our PFL Seminar enlightens clients with the above concerns and goes into detail on the following key learning objectives: 

1. 
 Knowledge
 of financial concepts; 

2. 
 Ability
 to live within means; 

3. 
 Management
 of expected and unexpected expenses; 

4. 
 Being
 vigilant to avoid financial scams; and 

5. 
 Ability
 to assess the risks and benefits of financial products and services. 

Session
2: Long-term Financial Planning Knowledge 

Session
2 of our PFL Seminar enlightens clients with the above concerns and goes into detail on the following key learning objectives: 

1. 
 The
 use of innovation guides and tools to improve long-term financial planning; 

2. 
 Awareness
 and knowledge of the benefits of seeking appropriate professional advice on financial planning; 

3. 
 The
 importance of voluntary savings and income diversification; and 

4. 
 The
 importance of long-term financial plans for retirement. 

The
desired outcomes of this session are inculcating clients with the habit of long-term planning for different life stages or events, such
as marriage, having children, performing pilgrimage, death and illness. Clients will also be aware of the importance of funding sufficiency
to meet their future financial needs and retirement life. 

Session
3: Protect Your Money 

We
believe it is increasingly important to be financially literate in this era of digitization, as online information can be overwhelming
and even inaccurate. Furthermore, as new financial products and services, such as internet banking and mobile payments, are growing in
popularity, the capability to validate and verify such information is crucial before making any financial decisions. 

5 

Expectations
of unrealistically high returns also increase the risk of falling victim to scams and illegal financial schemes. We believe with enough
financial knowledge; our clients will be able to make the distinction between legitimate products and fraudulent schemes and be aware
of avenues to seek help when in doubt. 

Session
3 of our PFL Seminar enlightens clients with the above concerns and goes into detail on the following key learning objectives: 

1. 
 Provide
 better understanding of risks and returns; 

2. 
 Improve
 awareness of the innovation of financial products and its implications; 

3. 
 Raise
 awareness on financial scams and fraud; and 

4. 
 Explain
 the risks of sophisticated financial products and services. 

Session
3 of PFL Seminar should increase clients awareness and understandings on the key features of certain financial products and services.
They should also be able to identify suitable financial products based on their risk appetites and objectives and make rational financial
decisions. 

Session
4: Personal Financial Report Preparation and Analysis 

Session
4 of our PFL Seminar equips our clients with the skills to generate their own Personal Financial Report by using third party financial
planning software with goal-planning and scenario-based features. The Personal Financial Report should take into consideration of local
financial markets system, social welfare system, quality of health care services, tax regulations and current economic indicators such
as inflation rate, nominal real interest, regional GDP growth rate and unemployment rate. 

We
also educate our clients on how to analyze their Personal Financial Reports to understand their financial situations and evaluate to
what extent their goals, needs and priorities can be met by their resources and current course of action. One useful function of the
Personal Financial Report is financial ratio analysis which allows the client to evaluate their financial health. The financial ratio
includes solvency ratio, investment assets to net worth ratio, debt to total assets ratio, debt to income ratio, liquidity ratio and
saving ratio. 

Based
on the Personal Financial Report, we also equip clients with the skills needed to forecast their pre-retirement wealth accumulation and
post-retirement expenses by assuming constant consumption and investment patterns. The Personal Financial Report also creates simulations
of both optimistic and pessimistic wealth accumulation scenarios, including longevity risks. Additionally, if the client is married or
in a long-term partnership, the plan should include survivorship considerations and projected financial scenarios for the surviving partner. 

Session
4 of our PFL Seminar intends to empower our clients to be able to prepare and analyze their Personal Financial Report which provides
guidance for rational decision-making and serves as both a roadmap to successful financial planning and a bulwark against potential mistakes
or misdeeds. Our proposed content of the Personal Financial Report is as follows: 

1. 
 Disclaimer 

2. 
 Financial
 Overview 

3. 
 Personal
 Information 

4. 
 Balance
 Sheet 

5. 
 Cash
 Flow 

6. 
 Financial
 Ratios Analysis 

7. 
 Financial
 Goals 

8. 
 Insurance
 Coverage 

9. 
 Investment
 Strategy 

We
will not advise any specific insurance product or investment product issued by any financial institutes, including bank, insurance company,
fund house, etc. This will enhance the independence and accuracy of the Personal Financial Report through avoidance of potential conflicts
of interest. Instead of any specific insurance or investment product, we will recommend the proposed amount of sum insured for insurance
portion while the asset class allocation for the investment strategy portion. 

Once
the client is satisfied with the Personal Financial Report generated, the client needs to decide the timing of implementation. We can
accompany the client to visit different financial institutes and help to sort out the suitable products, which are relevant and consistent
with their Personal Financial Reports, in order to avoid mis-selling or mis-matching between the client and products objective
and risk.

Personal
Financial Report Review and Evaluation Program 

Personal
Financial Report Review and Evaluation Program enables our existing clients to understand how their investment portfolio is performing
and whether their financial goals are likely to be achieved. Our clients can subscribe to the program after their Personal Financial
Reports are generated. We can review and re-assess a client s Personal Financial Report to check whether their portfolio management
is in line with their investment strategy, and whether any changes are required to achieve the clients goals. During the program,
the client can obtain a better picture on their goal achievement progress, process consistency and portfolio performance. Furthermore,
if there is any update on our program, we will invite those existing clients to join the updated session at a discounted fee. 

Pricing 

We
generate our revenues by providing FPL Seminar services to Hong Kong and Malaysian individuals and families. The one-time PFL seminar
fees are typically a flat fee, which is currently proposed as 5,000 for each client. 

Furthermore,
we charge our clients who subscribe to our Personal Financial Report Review and Evaluation Program recurring consulting fees. The amount
is negotiated on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature and extent of our services, such as investor coordination, investment advisory
services and distribution of periodic product performance reports computed. 

Marketing
Efforts 

We
believe word-of-mouth is an especially effective marketing tool for our business. We intend to engage in nationwide marketing initiatives
to further raise our brand awareness while continuing to improve client satisfaction to strengthen our word-of-mouth referrals. 

We
expect to increase our marketing efforts through our President s personal networks and industry association channels which have
not, at this point of time, been fully identified. Our President leverages various resources in performing tasks, including their social
connections and referrals from existing clients. 

Additionally,
we intend to bolster our professional reputation and image by showcasing our knowledge and industry expertise via marketing campaigns
through various forms of media, including our website at www.birdiewin.com. We have undefined plans to initially market our services
through webinars, the creation of a wide variety of white papers, newsletters, books, and other information offerings. Furthermore, we
plan to begin a social media campaign utilizing blogs, twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. A targeted campaign is intended to be made to
focus on individuals and families. At this point in time, we cannot state with any certainty when we will commence with the aforementioned
marketing activities. 

Competition 

The
financial literacy services industry is very competitive and fragmented in the market niche in which our Company operates. There are
limited barriers to entry and new competitors frequently enter the market. A significant number of our competitors possess substantially
greater resources than we possess. Additionally, we face substantial competition for potential clients and for technical and professional
personnel from providers of similar specialties, which range from giant national wealth management firm, private banks and family offices
headquartered in Hong Kong and Malaysia. 

The
majority of our competitors are banks, wealth management firms, and insurance brokers who aim to sell their own products by providing
financial literacy services. As such, we feel that we have a competitive advantage over many of our competitors, in that we do not sell
any specific insurance or investment product, and instead strive to maintain our independence and avoid potential conflicts of interest.
We believe that our clients will feel assured that the quality of our services and recommendations are not hampered by the need to sell
any additional products. 

We
believe that existing and new competitors will continue to improve their services and introduce new services with competitive pricing
and performance characteristics. In periods of reduced demand for our services, we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing
our prices to meet competition or maintain prices, which would likely sacrifice market share. Sales and overall profitability could be
reduced in either case. 

7 

Employees 

Currently,
we have one employee which is our President and Chief Executive Officer, Yunyuan Chen. Currently, Yunyuan Chen has the flexibility to
work on our business up to 15 hours per week, but is prepared to devote more time if necessary. 

We
do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt
plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our employee, Officer and/or Director. We have no employment
agreements at this time with our officers and directors. We intend to hire more staffs to assist in the development and execution of
our business operations. 

Government
Regulations 

Birdie
Win Corporation solely provides financial literacy seminar services, and we will not take part in any distribution of financial products,
such as insurance or investment products. We are not required to obtain any license that we are aware of except possibly business registration
licenses in jurisdictions we may intend to operate in. 

However,
from time to time during one-on-one PFL Seminar and Personal Financial Report Review and Evaluation Program, the Company or employee
of the Company will come across personal data as defined under Malaysia Personal Data Protective Act 2010 (herein referred as PDPA ).
According to PDPA, Data User, such as the Company or employee of the Company, shall not process personal data about a data subject unless
the data subject has given his consent to the processing of the personal data.

ITEM
5. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

The
Company sole class of common equity is currently quoted under OTC Markets Pink Sheet under symbol BRWC since March 23, 2023. The Company
believes that we do not have an established public trading market and we cannot assure you that there will be any liquidity for our common
stock in the future and such quotation reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily
represent actual transactions. 

Holders 

As
of July 31, 2024, we have 11 shareholders on record of our common stock. 

Transfer
Agent and Registrar 

The
transfer agent for our capital stock is Transfer Online, Inc, with an address at 512 SE Salmon St., Portland, OR 97214, United States
and telephone number is +1 (503) 227-2950. 

Penny
Stock Regulations 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of 1,000,000, or annual
incomes exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

Dividends 

Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 should be
read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this report.
Some of the information contained in this management s discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including
information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward looking statements that involve
risks, uncertainties and assumptions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors 
section in Form S-1/A registration statement, filed on August 27, 2021, our actual results could differ materially from the results described
in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report.

Overview 

Birdie
Win Corporation is headquartered in Hong Kong . The Company s executive office is located
at U nit 8, 6/F, Wayson Commercial Building, 28 Connaught Road West, Hong Kong. We offer
one-on-one Personal Financial Literacy Seminar services, with a focus on providing such services to customers in Malaysia and Hong Kong
individuals or families. 

Our
cash and cash equivalents are 1,845 as of July 31, 2024. Our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations
for any period of time. In order to continue our current business plan and increase our current level of operations for the next twelve-month
period, we require further funding. 

For
the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 24,082 and used cash in operating activities of 3,155. As
reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 296 and working capital deficit of 433. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon the Company s profit generating operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its
obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. These consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company expects to finance its operations primarily through cash flow from revenue and continuing financial support from a shareholder.
In the event that we require additional funding to finance the growth of the Company s current and expected future operations as
well as to achieve our strategic objectives, the shareholder has indicated the intent and ability to provide additional financing. 

No
assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory
to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations,
in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures ,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), means
controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the
reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded as of July 31, 2024, that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority
of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in
the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk
assessment ; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines; and (4) lack of internal audit function due to the fact that the Company lacks qualified
resources to perform the internal audit functions properly and that the scope and effectiveness of the internal audit function are yet
to be developed. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the review
of our financial statements as of July 31, 2024. 

14 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However,
management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors
results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result
in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management s review and approval
of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the Company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being
 made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing
of the operational effectiveness of these controls. 

15 

Based
on this assessment, management has concluded that as of July 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses
and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

We
will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function. We will create a position to
segregate duties consistent with control objectives. And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors
who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the
establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made
by management when funds are available to us. 

We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2025. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting: 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered independent
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Yunyuan
Chen - Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director 

Yunyuan
Chen worked for Zhaoqing Guangrong Investment Management Co., Ltd. as Director in Guangdong and Hong Kong from 2007 to 2010, worked for
Hong Kong Tims Investment Ltd as Director from 2011 to 2015, and is Managing Director of Shenzhen Qianhai Rongjian Fund Management Co.,
Ltd. Yunyuan Chen holds a Master s Degree in Business Administration awarded by Sun Yat-Sen University in 2006. 

Yunyuan
Chen currently acts as the President, Chief Executive
Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director of Birdie Win Corporation, specializing in business growth, profitable growth and marketing. 

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications
made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally
adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers and Directors as the Company
is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company review the Company s internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees
of the Board 

Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Director(s) believe that it is not necessary to have
such committees, at this time, because the Directors can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

17 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term
is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14)
of the FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because
management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that
retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our
Directors and our Officers have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 bankruptcy
 petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
 bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any
 conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
 offenses); 
 
 3. 
 being
 subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
 permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities
 or banking activities; or 
 
 4. 
 being
 found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have
 violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 
 
 5. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State
 securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended,
 or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated
 any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not
 been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not
 subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of: (i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities
 law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited
 to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist
 order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with
 any business entity; or 
 
 8. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory
 organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section
 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that
 has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence
of Directors 

We
are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such
time as we are required to do so. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

SECTION
16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10 of our common stock,
to file reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, our securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide
us with copies of those filings. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written representations by
our officers and directors regarding their compliance with applicable reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements for our executive officers, directors and 10 stockholders were met during the
year ended July 31, 2024.

of such executives.

our small size and limited financial resources, we have not adopted formal policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification
of transactions, such as those described above, with our executive officer(s), Director(s) and significant stockholders. We intend to
establish formal policies and procedures in the future, once we have sufficient resources and have appointed additional Directors, so
that such transactions will be subject to the review, approval or ratification of our Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee
thereof. On a moving forward basis, our Directors will continue to approve any related party transaction.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets Birdie Win Corporation. (the Company as of July 31, 2024 and the related
statements of operations and comprehensive loss, statement of changes in stockholders equity, and statement of cash flows for
the year ended July 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2024, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
12 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered losses from operations, used cash in operating activities and has a net capital
deficiency. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 12. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the Board of Director (Those Charged with Governance) that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to
the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there are
no critical matters.

and used cash in operating activities of . As
reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of and working capital deficit of . These conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon the Company s profit generating operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its
obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. These financial statements do not
include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company expects to finance its operations primarily through
cash flow from revenue and continuing financial support from a shareholder. In the event that we require additional funding to finance
the growth of the Company s current and expected future operations as well as to achieve our strategic objectives, the shareholder
has indicated the intent and ability to provide additional financing.
