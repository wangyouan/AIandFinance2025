ASIA
DIAMOND EXCHANGE AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CENTER IN VIETNAM 

Along
with the establishment of Philux Global Funds, the Company has worked with the Authority of Chu Lai Open Economic Zone in Central Vietnam
and the Provinces of Quang Nam and Dong Nai, Vietnam, to develop the Asia Diamond Exchange for lab-grown, rough and polished diamond
together with a multi-commodities and logistics centers. 

Mr.
Ben Smet, who successfully established the Dubai Diamond Exchange in 2002-2005, has been leading fulltime a group of experts for the
setup of the Asia Diamond Exchange since January 2018. He has brought together the main trading players in the rough diamond industry
to come to Vietnam. He has also established a partnership with the biggest player in the rough trading and polishing business and engaged
other main international diamond trading groups to join the overall venture. 

The
Company has taken the decision to move the greater part of the ADE rough and polishing venture, first to an Industrial Zone to be established
close to the new international Airport in Long Thanh District, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, and currently aiming at the Thanh Da Peninsula
in conjunction with the contemplated International Financial Center. This location change has caused that the entire KPC Process and
administration had to be adapted and redone with renewed financial input, mostly carried by Mr. Smet. 

Mr.
Smet has started a structuring project, in order for PHI to set up and establish an International Financial Center in conjunction with
the Asia Diamond Exchange. This will be similar as what Mr. Smet has established successfully for Dubai in 2002-2005 and this now incorporating
the international changes of the last decade. 

Once
the Company has effectuated all budgeting and all financial requirements and obligations, the ongoing process will effectively materialize
and Mr. Smet then shall transfer the entire venture to Philux Global Group, Inc. 

The
Company has incorporated Asia Diamond Exchange, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, ID number 2021-001010234, as the holding company for the
development of the Asia Diamond Exchange in Vietnam.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

RISK FACTORS 

Investment in our securities is subject to various
risks, including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. The following sets forth factors related to our business, operations,
financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could cause an investment in our securities to decline and result
in a loss. 

General
Risks Related to Our Business 

Our
success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations. 

Our
future success will depend in substantial part on the continued service of our senior management and certain external experts. The loss
of the services of one or more of our key personnel and/or outside experts could impede implementation and execution of our business
strategy and result in the failure to reach our goals. We do not carry key person life insurance for any of our officers or employees.
Our future success will also depend on the continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse
areas required for continuing our operations. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we will be able
to attract, train or retain qualified personnel in the future. 

Risks
Related to Mergers and Acquisitions 

Our
strategy in mergers and acquisitions involves a number of risks and we have a limited history of successful acquisitions. Even when an
acquisition is completed, we may have to continue our service for integration that may not produce results as positive as management
may have projected. 

The
Company continues evaluating various opportunities and negotiating to acquire other companies, assets and technologies. Acquisitions
entail numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion of management s
attention from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
We have limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations into our operations. Although potential synergy may be achieved by
acquisitions of related technologies and businesses, no assurance can be given as to the Company s ability to integrate successfully
any operations, personnel, services or products that have been acquired or might be acquired in the future. Failure to successfully assimilate
acquired organizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and operating results. 

Acquisitions
involve a number of special risks, including: 

failure
 of the acquired business to achieve expected results; 

diversion
 of management s attention; 

failure
 to retain key personnel of the acquired business; 

additional
 financing, if necessary and available, could increase leverage, dilute equity, or both; 

the
 potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles; and 

the
 high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities. 

These
risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition since the values of the securities
received for the consulting service at the execution of the acquisition depend on the success of the company involved in acquisition.
In addition, our ability to further expand our operations through acquisitions may be dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient working
capital, either through cash flows generated through operations or financing activities or both. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. 

Risks
associated with private equity (PE) funds 

There
are, broadly, five key risks to private equity investing: 

1.
 Operational risk: The risk of loss resulting from inadequate processes and systems supporting the organization. It is a
key consideration for investors regardless of the asset classes that funds invest into. 

7 

2.
 Funding risk: This is the risk that investors are not able to provide their capital commitments and is effectively the
 investor default risk . PE funds typically do not call upon all the committed investor capital and only draw capital once
they have identified investments. Funding risk is closely related to liquidity risk, as when investors are faced with a funding shortfall
they may be forced to sell illiquid assets to meet their commitments. 

3.
 Liquidity risk: This refers to an investor s inability to redeem their investment at any given time. PE investors
are locked-in for between five and ten years, or more, and are unable to redeem their committed capital on request during
that period. Additionally, given the lack of an active market for the underlying investments, it is difficult to estimate when the investment
can be realized and at what valuation. 

4.
 Market risk: There are many forms of market risk affecting PE investments, such as broad equity market exposure, geographical/sector
exposure, foreign exchange, commodity prices, and interest rates. Unlike in public markets where prices fluctuate constantly and are
marked-to-market, PE investments are subject to infrequent valuations and are typically valued quarterly and with some element of subjectivity
inherent in the assessment. However, the market prices of publicly listed equities at the time of sale of a portfolio company will ultimately
impact realization value. 

5.
 Capital risk: The capital at risk is equal to the net asset value of the unrealized portfolio plus the future undrawn commitments.
In theory, there is a risk that all portfolio companies could experience a decline in their current value, and in the worst-case drop
to a valuation of zero. Capital risk is closely related to market risk. Whilst market risk is the uncertainty associated with unrealized
gains or losses, capital risk is the possibility of having a realized loss of the original capital at the end of a fund s life. 

There
are two main ways that capital risk brings itself to bear - through the failure of underlying companies within the PE portfolio and suppressed
equity prices which make exits less attractive. The former is impacted by the quality of the fund manager, i.e. their ability to select
portfolio companies with good growth prospects and to create value, hence why fund manager selection is key for investors. The condition,
method, and timing of the exit are all factors that can affect how value can be created for investors. 

Risks
Associated with Building and Operating a Diamond Exchange 

Fundamentally,
the key requirements for a successful diamond exchange include the following: 

1.
 Supply : One of the most important things for a successful trading hub is the ability to secure ample, stable, and sustainable
supply of commodities. In the case of a diamond exchange, adequate supply of rough diamond must be secured to make it successful. 

2.
 Capital : Besides the infrastructure, facilities, systems, and amenities to operate the diamond exchange, the organizers
must be able to arrange very large amounts of capital to facilitate the trade and other business activities related to the exchange. 

3.
 Participants : The organizers must be able to attract a large number of international diamonteers to participate in the
exchange. There is no guarantee that people will come when the exchange is built. 

4.
 Venue: The venue must be able to provide competitive advantages compared with existing diamond exchanges in the world in
terms of (a) modern facilities, latest technologies and state-of-the-art provisions, (b) tax relief, (c) financial facilitating network
from big investors, (d) retail banking, lending institutions and foreign exchange facilities, (e) licenses and registrations, (f) global

Risks
Associated with International Markets 

As
some of our business activities are currently involved with international markets, any adverse change to the economy or business environment
in these countries could significantly affect our operations, which would lead to lower revenues and reduced profitability . 

Some
of our business activities are currently involved with non-US countries. Because of this presence in specific geographic locations, we
are susceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in this region, including stock market
fluctuation. A stagnant or depressed economy in these countries generally, or in any of the other markets that we serve, could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Risks
Related to Our Securities 

Insiders
have substantial control over the company, and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control, even if our other stockholders
wanted such a change to occur. 

Though
our executive officers and directors as of the date of this report, in the aggregate, only hold a small portion of our outstanding common
stock, we have the majority voting rights associated with the Company s Class B Series I Preferred Stock, which decision may allow
the Board of Directors to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors
and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us even
if our other stockholders wanted it to occur. 

The
price at which investors purchase our common stock may not be indicative of the prevailing market price. 

The
stock market often experiences significant price fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies
whose stock is traded. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares. Investors may be unable to sell
their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses. 

Since
we do not currently meet the requirements for our stock to be quoted on NASDAQ, NYSE MKT LLC or any other senior exchange, the tradability
in our securities will be limited under the penny stock regulations. 

Under
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the price of our securities on the OTCQB or OTC Markets is below 5.00 per share,
our securities are within the definition of a penny stock. As a result, it is possible that our securities may be subject
to the penny stock rules and regulations. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required
to comply with the Commission s regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock. These regulations require broker-dealers to: 

Make
a suitability determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser; 

 Receive
the purchaser s written consent to the transaction; and 

 Provide
certain written disclosures to the purchaser. 

These
requirements may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may affect the ability to resell our securities. 

Our
compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us. 

It
may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance staff in order to develop
and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with the internal controls requirements
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires
publicly traded companies to obtain.

HISTORICAL
FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS 

SHORT
TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK 

In
the course of its business, the Company has obtained short-term loans from individuals and institutional investors and from time to time
raised money by issuing restricted common stock of the Company under the auspices of Rule 144. These notes typically bear interest rates
ranging from 0 to 36 per annum but sometimes may have higher interest rates (Notes 8 10). 

12 

CONVERTIBLE
PROMISSORY NOTES 

The
Company has also from time to time issued convertible promissory notes to various private investment funds for short-term working capital
and special projects. Typically, these notes bear interest rates from 5 to 12 per annum, mature within one year, are convertible to
common stock of the Company at a discount ranging from 42 to 50 , and may be repaid within 180 days at a prepayment premium ranging
from 130 to 150 (Note 8). 

COMPANY S
PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS 

In
the next twelve months the Company aims to focus on commercializing the geomagnetic energy technology, advancing the Philux Global Select
Growth Fund under Philux Global Funds SCA, SICAV-RAIF, developing the Asia Diamond Exchange and International Financial Center in Vietnam
as well as carrying out merger and its acquisition program and also investing in special situations. We will also continue to provide
advisory and consulting services to international clients through our wholly owned subsidiary Philux Capital Advisors, Inc. and Philux
Global Advisors, Inc. 

The
Company will continue to work on the multiple financing agreements amounting to several billion dollars with international investor groups,
as reported in various 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company intends to use these funds to commercialize
the geomagnetic energy technology, advance the Philux Global Select Growth Fund under Philux Global Funds SCA, SICAV-RAIF, implement
the Asia Diamond Exchange and International Financial Center in Vietnam as well as carry out merger and its acquisition program. We have
devoted intense efforts on closing some of these transactions and expect to begin receiving capital through these sources in the near
future to support our business plan. 

FINANCIAL
PLANS 

MATERIAL
CASH REQUIREMENTS: We must raise substantial amounts of capital to fulfill our business plans. We intend to use equity, debt and project
financing to meet our capital needs for investments and acquisitions. 

Management
has taken action and formulated plans to meet the Company s operating needs through June 30, 2025 and beyond. The working capital
cash requirements for the next 12 months are expected to be generated from operations and additional financing. The Company also plans
to generate revenues from its consulting services, merger and acquisition advisory services, and acquisitions of target companies with
positive cash flows. 

AVAILABLE
FUTURE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS: The Company may use various sources of funds, including short-term loans, long-term debt, equity capital,
and project financing as may be necessary. The Company believes it will be able to secure the required capital to implement its business
plan. 

EQUITY
LINE OF CREDIT WITH INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR 

On
March 01, 2022, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement with an institutional investor The Investor as
follows: 

The
Investor will provide an equity line of up to 10,000,000 to the Company, pursuant to which the Company has the right, but not the obligation,
during the 24 months after an effective registration of the underlying shares, to issue a notice to the Investor (each a Drawdown
Notice which shall specify the amount of registered shares of common stock of the Company (the Put Shares that
the Company elects to sell to the Investor, from time to time, up to an aggregate amount equal to 10,000,000. 

The
pricing period of each put will be the 7 trading days immediately following receipt of the Put Shares (the Pricing Period ). 

The
purchase price per share shall mean 90 of the average of the 2 lowest volume-weighted average prices of the Common Stock during the
Pricing Period, less clearing fees, brokerage fees, other legal, and transfer agent fees incurred in the deposit (the Net Purchase
Amount ). The Investor shall pay the Net Purchase Amount to the Company by wire for each Drawdown Notice within 2 business days
of the end of the Pricing Period. 

13 

The
put amount in each Drawdown Notice shall not be less than 50,000 and shall not exceed the lesser of (i) 500,000 or (ii) 200 of the
average dollar trading volume of the Common Stock during the 7 trading days immediately before the Put Date, subject to Beneficial Ownership
cap. 

There
shall be a 7 trading day period between the receipt of the Put Shares and the next put. 

The
Company intends to file an S-1 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for this Equity Line of Credit. 

ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The
following discussion about PHI Group Inc. s market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements. 

Currency
Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk 

Some
of our acquisition targets and partner companies are located outside of the United States and use currencies other than the U.S. dollar
as the official currencies of those countries. The fluctuations of exchange rates in these countries may affect the value of our business. 

Interest
Rate Risk 

We
do not have significant interest rate risk, as most of our debt obligations are primarily short-term in nature to individuals, with fixed
interest rates. 

Valuation
of Securities Risk 

Since
some of our income in the past was paid with the marketable securities, the value of our assets may fluctuate significantly depending
on the market value of the securities we hold.

Fair Value - Valuation Techniques and Inputs 

The Company holds and may invest public securities
traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC), private securities, real estate, convertible securities, interest bearing securities
and other types of securities and has adopted specific techniques for their respective valuations. 

Equity Securities in Public Companies 

Unrestricted 

The
Company values investments in securities that are freely tradable and listed on major securities exchanges at their last reported sales
price as of the valuation date. To the extent these securities are actively traded and valuation adjustments are not applied, they are
categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Securities
traded on inactive markets or valued by reference to similar instruments are generally categorized in Level 2 or 3 of the fair value
hierarchy. 

Restricted 

Securities
traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) where there are formal restrictions that limit (i.e. Rule 144 holding periods and
underwriter s lock-ups) their sale shall be valued at the closing price on the date of valuation less applicable discounts. The
Company may apply a discount to securities with Rule 144 restrictions. Additional discounts may be assessed if the Company believes there
are other mitigating factors which warrant the additional discounting. When determining potential additional discounts, factors that
will be taken into consideration include, but are not limited to; securities trading characteristics, volume, length and overall
impact of the restriction as well as other macro-economic factors. Valuations should be discounted appropriately until the securities
may be freely traded. 

If
it has been determined that the exchange or OTC listed price does not accurately reflect fair market value, the Company may elect to
treat the security as a private company and apply an alternative valuation method. 

Investments
in restricted securities of public companies may be included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, to the extent that significant
inputs used to determine liquidity discounts are not observable, investments in restricted securities in public companies may be categorized
in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The
Company s financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, short-term
notes payable, convertible notes, derivative liability and accounts payable. 

As
of the balance sheet dates, the estimated fair values of the financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying
values as presented on the balance sheet. This is primarily attributed to the short maturities of these instruments. 

Effective
July 1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820 (previously SFAS 157), Fair Value Measurements and adopted this Statement for the assets
and liabilities shown in the table below. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value,
establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value
measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have a material impact on our fair value measurements. ASC 820 permits the Company to defer
the recognition and measurement of the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until January 1, 2010. At June 30, 2023, the
Company did not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value. ASC 820 requires
that financial assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value be categorized as one of the types of investments based upon the
methodology mentioned in Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 above for determining fair value. 

Assets
measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below. The Company also has convertible notes and derivative liabilities as
disclosed in this report that are measured at fair value on a regular basis until paid off or exercised. 

The
Company uses various approaches to measure fair value of available-for-sale securities, while applying the three-level valuation hierarchy
for disclosures, specified in ASC 820. Our Level 1 securities were measured using the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
and liabilities. 

The
company s policy regarding the transfers in and/or out of Level 3 depends on the trading activity of the security, the volatility
of the security, and other observable units which clearly represents the fair value of the security. If a level 3 security can be measured
using a more fairly represented fair value, we will transfer these securities either into Level 1 or Level 2, depending on the type of
inputs.

 and are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

Update
No. 2018-13 August 2018 

Fair
Value Measurement (Topic 820): Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement 

Modifications:
The following disclosure requirements were modified in Topic 820: 

1.
In lieu of a roll-forward for Level 3 fair value measurements, a nonpublic entity is required to disclose transfers into and out of Level
3 of the fair value hierarchy and purchases and issues of Level 3 assets and liabilities. 

2.
For investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value, an entity is required to disclose the timing of liquidation of an
investee s assets and the date when restrictions from redemption might lapse only if the investee has communicated the timing to
the entity or announced the timing publicly. 

3.
The amendments clarify that the measurement uncertainty disclosure is to communicate information about the uncertainty in measurement
as of the reporting date. 

Additions:
The following disclosure requirements were added to Topic 820; however, the disclosures are not required for nonpublic entities: 

1.
The changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements
held at the end of the reporting period. 

2.
The range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. For certain unobservable
inputs, an entity may disclose other quantitative information (such as the median or arithmetic average) in lieu of the weighted average
if the entity determines that other quantitative information would be a more reasonable and rational method to reflect the distribution
of unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. 

The
amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2019. 

Update
No. 2018-07 June 2018 

Compensation
 Stock Compensation (Topic 718) 

Improvements
to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting 

Main
Provisions: The amendments in this Update expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods
and services from nonemployees. An entity should apply the requirements of Topic 718 to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance
on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost (that is, the period of time over which share-based payment awards vest
and the pattern of cost recognition over that period). The amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions
in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor s own operations by issuing share-based payment
awards. The amendments also clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to
the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under
Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 

The
amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within that fiscal year.

All other entities are required to adopt ASC Topic 606 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting
periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. 

Update
No. 2016-10 - April 2016 

Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing 

The
core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: 

1.
Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 

 2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 

 3.
Determine the transaction price. 

 4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 

 5.
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

The
amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify
the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining
the related principles for those areas. 

The
Company has either evaluated or is currently evaluating the implications, if any, of each of these pronouncements and the possible impact
they may have on the Company s financial statements. In most cases, management has determined that the implementation of these
pronouncements would not have a material impact on the financial statements taken as a whole.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management carried
out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls
and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon their evaluation,
our management (including our Chief Executive Officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
June 30, 2023, based on the material weaknesses defined below. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control of Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is a set of processes designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal
financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets, 

provide
 reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance
 with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
 and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of authorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could
 have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that
any system of internal control, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the system will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
the Company s management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June
30, 2024 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

If
we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report
our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company. 

16 

The
material weaknesses related to a lack of a full segregation of duties and to our lack of sufficient personnel in our accounting and financial
reporting functions with sufficient experience and expertise with respect to the application of U.S. GAAP and related financial reporting. 

Based
on this assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June
30, 2024. 

Management s
Remediation Plan 

We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this
annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses,
we plan to implement the following changes in the future: 

(i) 
 appoint
 additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and 

(ii) 
 adopt
 sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. 

The
remediation efforts set out in (i) are largely dependent upon our company securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing
the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. 

Management
believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2024 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP. 

Attestation
Report of the Registered Accounting Firm 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to Rule 308(b) of Regulation S-K, which permits the Company to provide only management s report
in this Annual Report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting have come to management s attention during the Company s
last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting.
