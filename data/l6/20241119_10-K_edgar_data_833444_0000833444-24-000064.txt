PART I 

ITEM 1 BUSINESS 
 
 General 
 
 Johnson Controls International plc, headquartered in Cork, Ireland, is a global leader in smart, healthy and sustainable buildings, serving a wide range of customers in more than 150 countries. The Company s products, services, systems and solutions advance the safety, comfort and intelligence of spaces to serve people, places and the planet. The Company is committed to helping its customers win and creating greater value for all of its stakeholders through its strategic focus on buildings. 
 
 3 

Johnson Controls was originally incorporated in the state of Wisconsin in 1885 as Johnson Electric Service Company to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings and was renamed Johnson Controls, Inc. in 1974. In 2005, Johnson Controls acquired York International, a global supplier of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning ("HVAC") and refrigeration equipment and services. Following this acquisition, Johnson Controls continued to expand its portfolio of building related product and service offerings for residential and commercial customers. In 2016, Johnson Controls, Inc. and Tyco International plc ("Tyco") completed their combination (the "Merger"), combining Johnson Controls' portfolio of building efficiency solutions with Tyco s portfolio of fire and security solutions. Following the Merger, Tyco changed its name to Johnson Controls International plc. 
 
 In 2016, the Company completed the spin-off of its automotive business into Adient plc, an independent, publicly traded company. In 2019, the Company closed the sale of its Power Solutions business, completing the Company s transformation into a pure-play building technologies and solutions provider. 
 
 In 2024, the Company announced that it was evaluating its non-core product lines in connection with its objective to be a pure-play provider of technologies and solutions for commercial buildings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Air Distribution Technologies business included within its Global Products segment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Residential and Light Commercial ("R LC") HVAC business to Robert Bosch GmbH Bosch ). The R LC HVAC business includes the Company's North America ducted business and Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning Holding (UK) Ltd., the Company s global residential joint venture with Hitachi Global Life Solutions, Inc. Hitachi ), of which the Company owns 60 and Hitachi owns 40 . The sale of the R LC HVAC business is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 
 The Company is a global leader in engineering, manufacturing, commissioning and retrofitting building products and systems, including residential and commercial HVAC equipment, industrial refrigeration systems, controls, security systems, fire-detection systems and fire-suppression solutions. The Company further serves customers by providing technical services, including maintenance, management, repair, retrofit and replacement of equipment (in the HVAC, industrial refrigeration, security and fire-protection space), and energy-management consulting. The Company's OpenBlue digital software platform enables enterprises to better manage their physical spaces by combining the Company's building products and services with cutting-edge technology and digital capabilities to enable data-driven smart building services and solutions. The Company partners with customers by leveraging its broad product portfolio and digital capabilities powered by OpenBlue, together with its direct channel service and solutions capabilities, to deliver outcome-based solutions across the lifecycle of a building that address customers needs to improve energy efficiency, enhance security, create healthy environments and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
 Business Segments 
 
 The Company conducts its business through four business segments: 
 
 Building Solutions North America which operates in the United States and Canada; 
 Building Solutions EMEA/LA which operates in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America; 
 Building Solutions Asia Pacific which operates in Asia Pacific; and 
 Global Products which operates worldwide. 
 
 The Building Solutions segments: 
 
 Design, sell, install and service HVAC, controls, building management, refrigeration, integrated electronic security and integrated fire-detection and suppression systems; and 
 Provide energy-efficiency solutions and technical services, including data-driven "smart building" solutions as well as inspection, scheduled maintenance, and repair and replacement of mechanical and controls systems. 
 
 The Global Products segment designs, manufactures and sells: 
 
 HVAC equipment, controls software and software services; 
 Refrigeration equipment and controls; 
 Fire protection and suppression; and 
 Security products, including intrusion security, anti-theft devices, access control, and video surveillance and management systems. 
 
 4 

The Company s segments provide products and services primarily to commercial, institutional, industrial, data center, and governmental customers. 
 
 For more information on the Company s segments, refer to Note 19, "Segment Information," of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Products, Systems, Services and Solutions 
 
 The Company sells and installs its commercial HVAC equipment and systems, control systems, security systems, fire-detection and fire suppression systems, equipment and services primarily through its extensive direct channel, consisting of a global network of sales and service offices. Significant sales are also generated through global third-party channels, such as distributors of air-conditioning, controls, security and fire-detection and suppression products. The Company s large base of current customers leads to significant repeat business for the maintenance, retrofit and replacement markets. The Company is also able to leverage its installed base to generate sales for its service business. Trusted building brands, such as YORK , Metasys , Ansul, Frick , FM:Systems , PENN , Sabroe , Silent-Aire , Simplex and Grinnell , together with the breadth and depth of the products, systems and solutions offered by the Company, give it what it believes to be the most diverse portfolio in the building technology industry. 
 
 The Company has developed software platforms, including on-premises platforms and cloud-based software services, and integrated its products and services with digital capabilities to provide data-driven solutions to create smarter, safer and more sustainable buildings. The Company's OpenBlue platform enables enterprises to better manage their physical spaces delivering sustainability, new occupant experiences, safety and security by combining the Company s building expertise with cutting-edge technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning-powered service solutions such as remote diagnostics, predictive maintenance, workplace management, compliance monitoring and advanced risk assessments. The Company leverages its product portfolio and service network, together with digital and data-driven technologies to offer integrated and customizable solutions focused on delivering outcomes to customers, including OpenBlue Buildings-as-a-Service, OpenBlue Net Zero Buildings-as-a-Service and OpenBlue Healthy Buildings. These services are generally designed to generate recurring revenue for the Company as it supports its customers in achieving their desired outcomes. 
 
 In fiscal 2024, products and systems accounted for 70 of sales from continuing operations and services accounted for 30 of sales from continuing operations. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The Company conducts its operations through a significant number of individual contracts that are either negotiated or awarded on a competitive basis. Key factors in the award of contracts include system and service performance, quality, price, design, reputation, technology, application engineering capability, availability of financing and construction or project management expertise. Competitors for HVAC equipment, security, fire-detection, fire suppression and controls in the residential and non-residential marketplace include many local, regional, national and international providers. Larger competitors include Honeywell International, Inc.; Siemens Smart Infrastructure, an operating group of Siemens AG; Schneider Electric SA; Carrier Global Corporation; Trane Technologies plc; Daikin Industries, Ltd.; Lennox International, Inc.; GC Midea Holding Co, Ltd. and Gree Electric Appliances, Inc. In addition, the Company competes in a highly fragmented building services market. The Company also faces competition from a diverse range of established companies, start-ups and other emerging entrants to the buildings industry in the areas of digital services, software as a service and the Internet of Things. The loss of any individual contract or customer would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 
 Business Strategy 
 
 The Company s business strategy is to sustain and expand its position as a leader in commercial building technology and solutions by offering a full spectrum of products and solutions for commercial customers across the globe. In 2024, the Company acted to optimize its core commercial buildings portfolio with the sale of its Air Distribution Technologies business and the entry into a definitive agreement to sell its R LC HVAC business. Following these portfolio optimization actions, the Company s core strategy remains focused on creating growth platforms, driving operational improvements and creating a high-performance, customer-centric culture. 
 
 The Company has strong positions in attractive and growing end-markets across HVAC, controls, fire, security and services, enhanced by its comprehensive product portfolio and substantial installed base. The Company believes that it is well positioned to capitalize on the emerging and prevalent trends in the commercial buildings industry, including data centers, sustainable buildings, healthy buildings/indoor environmental quality and smart buildings. To capitalize on these trends, the Company 
 5 

remains focused on maintaining leading positions in delivering commercial building products, systems and solutions through its direct and indirect channels, as well as enabling growth through digital, to develop and leverage the breath of its portfolio to drive attachment, offer differentiated services and solutions over the building lifecycle and generate recurring revenue. In furtherance of these goals, the Company has four strategic priorities: 
 
 Capitalize on Key Growth Vectors: Data centers, sustainable buildings, healthy buildings/indoor environmental quality and smart buildings represent key growth opportunities for the Company. The Company seeks to leverage its existing portfolio breadth and investments in product development, combined with the expansion of its digital products and capabilities powered by OpenBlue, to offer differentiated solutions and innovative deal structures to help customers achieve their objectives. The Company intends to expand its capabilities by investing in products and technologies, as well as expanding its partnerships, to power innovation that will allow it to provide differentiated services that are tailored to its customers desired outcomes. 
 
 Bringing Value Across the Building Lifecycle : The Company provides system and service solutions that maximize the opportunities around the lifecycle of the building, delivering outcomes to the customer that save energy, reduce emissions and optimize building lifecycle costs while improving the overall occupant experience. The Company s ability to drive direct, integrated solutions within multiple domains enables opportunities for attachment, cross-selling, recurring revenue, and developing long term relationships with customers from installation to service, retrofit, and replacement. 
 
 Accelerate in High Growth Digital Services, Regions and Verticals : The Company is focused on transforming its large service business through digital technology, further enabled by the Company s installed base, domain expertise and global coverage. The Company is focused on developing and deploying connected equipment, systems and controls that will support the provision of digital services and solutions. The Company further intends to expand its presence in high growth regions and invest in high growth verticals within the markets it serves, including healthcare, commercial offices/campus, education and data centers. 
 
 Sustain a High-Performance, Customer-Centric Culture : The Company recognizes that developing talent and creating positive customer experiences is central to accomplishing its business strategies. The Company is investing in its talent to build a diverse workforce that is digital capable, solutions oriented and focused on continuous learning and growth. The Company aims to leverage its talent capabilities and training to create a customer-focused culture to drive customer loyalty and decisions. 
 
 To realize these priorities, the Company is leveraging its technology leadership, comprehensive product portfolio, global presence, substantial installed base and strong channels to monetize the lifecycle opportunities of systems, service, retrofit and replacement which are established and delivered by the Company s direct field businesses and third-party channels across the globe. The Company is augmenting its strategic priorities with disciplined execution, productivity enhancements and sustainable cost management to create a path to realize expanded margins and enhanced profitability. 
 
 Backlog and Orders 
 
 Backlog and orders are additional metrics that are meant to provide management with a deeper level of insight into the progress of specific strategic and growth initiatives. Backlog is applicable to sales of products and systems and services and totaled 15.2 billion at September 30, 2024, including both the Building Solutions and Global Products segments. Orders provide management with a signal of customer demand for the Company's products and services, as well as an indication of future revenues and performance. However, the timing and conversion of backlog and orders are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks and are not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year. 
 
 The following table summarizes backlog and orders for the Building Solutions segments: 
 Backlog Orders (in billions) September 30, 2024 Year-over-Year Change (1) 
 Year ended September 30, 2024 Year-over-Year Change (1) 
 Building Solutions North America 9.1 10 12.3 9 Building Solutions EMEA/LA 2.5 10 4.6 9 Building Solutions Asia Pacific 1.5 (10) 2.5 (8) Total Building Solutions 13.1 7 19.4 7 
 
 (1) Change is compared to September 30, 2023 (backlog) and the year ended September 30, 2023 (orders) and excludes the impact of mergers, acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency. 
 
 6 

Remaining performance obligations were 21.1 billion at September 30, 2024. Differences between the Company s remaining performance obligations and backlog are primarily due to: 
 Remaining performance obligations include large, multi-purpose contracts to construct hospitals, schools and other governmental buildings, which are services to be performed over the building's lifetime with average initial contract terms of 25 to 35 years for the entire term of the contract versus backlog which includes only the lifecycle period of these contracts which approximates five years; 
 Remaining performance obligations exclude service contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts that are cancellable without substantial penalty versus backlog which includes short-term and cancellable contracts; and 
 Remaining performance obligations include the full remaining term of service contracts with substantial termination penalties versus backlog which includes only one year for all outstanding service contracts. 
 
 The Company reports backlog, which it believes is a useful measure of evaluating the Company's operational performance and relationship to total orders. 
 
 Raw Materials 
 
 Raw materials used by the Company s businesses in connection with their operations include steel, aluminum, brass, copper, polypropylene and certain fluorochemicals used in fire suppression agents. The Company also uses semiconductors and other electronic components in the manufacture of its products. During fiscal 2022 and portions of fiscal 2023, the Company experienced material cost increases due to global inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, increased demand and other regulatory and macroeconomic factors. The collective impact of these trends were favorable to revenue due to increased demand and price increases to offset inflation, while negatively impacting margins due to supply chain disruptions and cost pressures. However, throughout fiscal 2023 and 2024, the Company experienced improved margins as supply chain disruptions eased and higher priced backlog was converted to sales, as discussed in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Although the Company has seen its supply chain normalize, the Company could experience further disruptions, shortages and price inflation in the future, the effect of which will depend on the Company s ability to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of these events. In fiscal 2025, commodity prices and availability could fluctuate throughout the year and could significantly affect the Company s results of operations. For a more detailed description of the risks related to the availability of raw materials, components and commodities, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Intellectual Property 
 
 Generally, the Company seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business. The Company protects its intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. The Company works actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to the Company's products, services, software, solutions, and branding. Certain intellectual property, where appropriate, is protected by contracts, licenses, confidentiality or other agreements. 
 
 The Company owns numerous U.S. and non-U.S. patents (and their respective counterparts), the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products. Internal development allows the Company to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over its products and services. While the Company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, no single patent, or group of patents, is critical to the success of the business. The Company, from time to time, grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others. 
 
 The Company s trademarks, certain of which are material to its business, are registered or otherwise legally protected in the U.S. and many non-U.S. countries where products and services of the Company are sold. The Company, from time to time, becomes involved in trademark licensing transactions. 
 
 Most works of authorship produced for the Company, such as computer programs, catalogs and sales literature, carry appropriate notices indicating the Company s claim to copyright protection under U.S. law and appropriate international treaties. 
 
 7 

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
 
 Laws addressing the protection of the environment and workers safety and health govern the Company s ongoing global operations. They generally provide for civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive and remedial relief, for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where Company-related materials have been released into the environment. 
 
 A portion of the Company s products consume energy and use refrigerants. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change has resulted in more regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulations tend to be implemented under global, national and sub-national climate objectives or policies, and target the global warming potential GWP of refrigerants, equipment energy efficiency, and the combustion of fossil fuels as a heating source. The Company continues to invest in its product portfolio to meet or exceed emerging emissions regulations and standards. 
 
 The Company has expended substantial resources globally, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance. Certain of the Company s businesses are, or have been, engaged in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment. The Company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances. 
 
 The Company s operations and facilities have been, and in the future may become, the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with environmental laws and worker safety laws or for the remediation of Company-related substances released into the environment. Such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance, abatement or remediation programs and, in some cases, payment of penalties. In addition, governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating perfluorooctane sulfonate ("PFOS"), perfluorooctanoic acid ("PFOA"), and/or other per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances ("PFAS"), which were contained in certain of the Company's legacy firefighting foam products. These regulations include declining emission standards and limits set as to the presence of certain compounds. See Note 21, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental matters. 
 
 Government Regulation and Supervision 
 
 The Company's operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in areas such as consumer protection, government contracts, international trade, environmental protection, labor and employment, tax, licensing and others. For example, most U.S. states and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Company operates have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries. The Company's security businesses currently rely extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals. Wireline and wireless telephone companies in the U.S. are regulated by the federal and state governments. In addition, government regulation of fire safety codes can impact the Company's fire businesses. The Company s businesses may also be affected by changes in governmental regulation of refrigerants, PFAS, energy efficiency standards, noise regulation and product safety regulations, including changes related to hydro fluorocarbons/emissions reduction efforts, energy conservation standards and the regulation of fluorinated gases. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which the Company conducts its business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect the Company's worldwide operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect the Company's business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Regulatory Capital Expenditures 
 
 The Company s efforts to comply with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable to its business and products often results in capital expenditures. The Company makes capital expenditures to design and upgrade its fire and security products to comply with or exceed standards applicable to the alarm, fire suppression and security industries. The Company also makes capital expenditures to meet or exceed energy efficiency standards and comply with applicable regulations, including the regulation of refrigerants, hydro fluorocarbons/emissions reduction efforts and the regulation of fluorinated gasses, particularly with respect to the Company s HVAC products and solutions. The Company s ongoing environmental compliance program also results in capital expenditures. Regulatory and environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions; however, expenditures in fiscal 2024 related solely to regulatory compliance were not material. It is management s expectation that the amount of any future capital expenditures related to compliance with any individual regulation or grouping of related regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial results or competitive position in any one year. See Note 21, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental matters.

Human Capital Management 
 
 Overview and Governance 
 
 The development of a High-Performance Culture enables the Company to achieve its purpose to build smarter, healthier, and more sustainable tomorrows. The Company s strategic drivers provide the direction that guides its workforce toward a culture of continuous improvement and innovation to exceed customers expectations and provide solutions for global challenges in the building systems industry. 
 
 The responsibility to develop and maintain a High-Performance Culture is owned, embedded and executed throughout the Company. The Chief Human Resources Officer ("CHRO") is responsible for establishing the Company s strategy to drive a High-Performance Culture and ensuring its execution across the Company. The Compensation and Talent Development Committee of the Board of Directors is the primary overseer of the Company s High-Performance Culture strategy and execution, ensuring that the Company presents an employee value proposition that supports retention and the attraction of external talent. The Governance and Sustainability Committee is the primary overseer of employee health and safety. The Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), the CHRO, the General Counsel, the Vice President of Global Environment Health Safety, the Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and other senior leaders within the Company are responsible for the execution of the strategy and engage with the Compensation and Talent Development Committee, the Governance and Sustainability Committee and the full Board of Directors on the critical components driving the Company s High-Performance Culture, including discussions of future of work, human capital trends, processes and practices, diversity, equity and inclusion, health and safety, talent development, company culture and succession planning. Key components driving the Company s High-Performance Culture include: 
 
 Health and Safety 
 
 Health and Wellness, Safety and Environment are the three pillars of the Company s Zero Harm vision. The Company s health and safety programs are designed around global standards with appropriate variations addressing multiple jurisdictions and regulations, specific hazards and unique working environments of the Company s manufacturing, service, systems, and headquarter operations. 
 
 The Company requires each of its locations to perform regular safety audits to ensure proper safety policies, program procedures, analyses and training are in place. In addition, the Company engages an independent third-party conformity assessment and certification vendor to audit selected operations for adherence to its global health and safety standards. Cultural and values-based safety initiatives have been deployed within the Company to sustain and further enhance performance. 
 
 The Company utilizes a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of its operations. Lagging indicators include the OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR") and the Lost Time (or Lost Workday) Incident Rate ("LTIR") based upon the number of incidents per 100 employees (or per 200,000 work hours). In fiscal 2024, the Company had a TRIR of 0.34 and a LTIR of 0.13. 
 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
 The Company is dedicated to creating a workplace where diversity is celebrated, where every employee feels included and valued, and where equitable practices are the norm. The Company aims to foster a culture of innovation, collaboration, and respect that drives its success in the global marketplace. Diversity, equity, and inclusion DEI is a component of the Company s strategy to drive a High-Performance Culture, recognized as adding value to the Company s creation and delivery of innovative high performing products and enabling solutions to its customers toughest problems. The Company has elevated its focus on equity to enable all employees to have access to the opportunities, resources, support and networks they need to develop and succeed. The Company empowers employees to take an active role in creating a culture that values uniqueness, celebrates creativity and drives innovation. The Company encourages employees to enable an inclusive culture through active participation in Business Resource Groups ("BRGs") - employee-led voluntary organizations of people with similar interests, experiences, or demographic characteristics. The Company continues to increase participation in its BRG chapters worldwide across eleven categories: African American, Asia Pacific, LGBTQ+, Emerging Leaders, Hispanic, Disabilities, Veterans, Women, Sustainability, Parents and Caregivers, and Mindful Living. Each BRG is open to all employees and sponsored and supported by senior leaders across the enterprise. The Company s BRG structure includes monthly learning series, an active recruitment platform, an innovation hub, community engagement and feedback sessions. The Company also engages BRGs to support the acquisition and development of diverse talent internally and externally. 
 
 9 

The Company is committed to enabling employees to bring their authentic selves to work each day, which in turn adds value, fosters creativity, and inspires change across the organization. The Company recognizes that it is its people that make the Company exceptional. The Company has developed robust policies and strategies to support this vision in its operations and its communities, including strategies addressing social impact and employee experience. The Company is committed to the implementation of its DEI mission, vision and roadmap including a focus on employee experience, business resource groups, learning and development and external impact. 
 
 The Company recognizes that fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment requires ongoing commitment, accountability, and continuous improvement. The Company regularly assesses its progress, recognizes employee contributions, and holds leaders accountable for driving DEI initiatives. The Company also creates mechanisms for open dialogue and feedback from employees to ensure that everyone s voices are heard. 
 
 The Company has implemented several measures that focus on ensuring accountabilities exist for fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment: 
 
 Diversity Objectives: The CEO and other senior leaders have diversity and inclusion objectives in their annual performance goals. 
 
 Attracting Diverse Talent: BRGs are instrumental in positively impacting the attraction of diverse talent to the Company. BRGs support these efforts through external engagement and support of talent acquisition sourcing initiatives. The Company s global flagship Future Leaders Internship Program continues to expand the diversity of its outreach and focus on the skills needed to advance the Company s growth initiatives. In 2024, the Company, in response to employee feedback, launched the Mindful Living and Parents and Caregivers Together ("PACT") BRG groups. Interest and enthusiasm has been strong, and the new BRGs are growing membership at the fastest pace of any BRG group. 
 
 Honoring Employee Contributions: The Company s Diversity Distinction Awards serve as a recognition and encouragement for workforce contributions to the Company s DEI efforts. Awarded to eight employees three times per year, the nomination driven Diversity Distinction Awards have become a highly regarded recognition of employee s contribution to the progress of the Company s DEI journey. 
 
 Talent Development 
 
 The Company must ensure the continued development and advancement of its employees to maintain a High-Performance Culture. The Company has adopted a continuous improvement approach to talent development, working to support employees growth while defining the skills and capabilities the organization will need in future years. To assess current enterprise capabilities and define future needs, strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur on a planned cadence annually globally and across all business areas. The Company continues to provide opportunities for its employees to grow their careers, with more than half of open management positions filled internally during fiscal 2024. 
 
 The Company believes that high performance is an outcome of an employee s ability to change, adapt, and grow their capabilities throughout their career. This talent development approach includes self and multi-rater assessments, functional and leadership competency models, providing employees a personalized approach to their development planning and skill acquisition. The Company emphasizes real-life, real-time learning that enables each employee to meet the demands of challenging and changing work and focuses on reinforcing key principles that are designed to support an individual s effectiveness in his or her current job and in their future development. The Company provides technical and leadership training to employees, customers and suppliers who work for or with the Company s products and services. 
 
 The Company s focus on employee development has been structured over the last several years through programs designed to imbed essential skills with employees and reinforce strategic goals aligning with the Company s culture, including: 
 
 Digital Transformation: In support of Company s growth strategy, the Company is investing in developing digital leadership with personalized and targeted training programs designed to create digitally capable leaders, salespersons, engineers and technicians. 
 
 Diversity and Inclusion: The Company has developed a structured diversity and inclusion education curriculum across the levels and stages of individuals' careers to develop and align employees with the Company s diversity and inclusion strategy and values. The Dimensions training program is designed to develop careers of under-represented talent and a toolkit for managers to guide their self-led inclusion efforts. In fiscal 2024, the program was expanded 
 10 

beyond North America to a global audience. The Company s flagship Women in Leadership ("WIL") program continues to grow in participation with a total increase of 162 since inception in 2022. The program is demonstrating measurable impact with 28 of original cohort participants being promoted since program completion. 
 
 In fiscal 2024, the Company offered a robust curriculum of almost 225,000 activities that were completed by employees, consisting of videos, courses, e-learning, documentation, articles and books, including over 4,000 active (in person or virtual) learning courses. In fiscal 2024, over 1.17 million learning activities were completed by over 81,000 employees (excluding non-wired). The total learning hours consumed by employees was 1.58 million hours, averaging almost 20 hours per employee including time invested in formal learning and standard time invested in self-paced reading or video consumption. 
 
 Organizational Engagement 
 
 The Company measures the engagement of its employees using a quarterly pulse survey initially launched in fiscal 2023. The engagement survey provides managers with their own data dashboard to view their own engagement results and can be utilized by managers at all levels to understand how to improve the Company s culture and employee engagement. Managers are provided with resources to interpret their results and plan their actions following each survey. 
 
 Employee Population and Demographics 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company employed approximately 94,000 people worldwide, of which approximately 35,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 59,000 were outside the United States. Approximately 22,000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and the Company believes that its relations with its labor unions are generally positive. 
 
 Employee Diversity as of September 30, 2024 
 Male Female Minority (1) 
 Total employees 77 23 31 Managers 79 21 22 
 (1) Male and female data represents all employees globally. Minority data represents U.S. employees only. 
 
 Seasonal Factors 
 
 Certain of the Company's sales are seasonal as the demand for residential air conditioning equipment and services generally increases in the summer months. This seasonality is mitigated by the other products and services provided by the Company that have no material seasonal effect. 
 
 Research and Development Expenditures 
 
 Refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for research and development expenditures. The Company has committed to invest a substantial portion of its new product research and development in climate and efficiency-related innovation to develop sustainable products and services. The Company invests in enhancements to the capabilities of its product lines and services to support its strategy, meet consumer preferences and achieve regulatory compliance. This includes investments in the development of the Company s OpenBlue platform and related service offerings, digital product capabilities, energy efficient products, and low GWP refrigerants and technology.

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 
 
 Provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. The disclosure of a risk should not be interpreted to imply that such risk has not already materialized. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes are immaterial may also impair the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business Operations 
 
 Our future growth is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new products, services and technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins. 
 
 Our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire, manufacture and bring competitive, and increasingly complex, products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively. Our ability to develop or acquire new products, services and technologies requires the investment of significant resources. These acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies, products or services on a timely basis. Further, we must continue to effectively adapt our products and services to a changing technological and regulatory environment to drive growth and defend against disruption caused by competitors, regulators or other external forces impacting our business and operations. If we are unable to be agile and responsive to disruption in the development of new products, services and technologies, including technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 
 Even after introduction, new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products. Further, as we integrate emerging and rapidly evolving technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning into our products and services, we may not be able to anticipate or identify vulnerabilities, design flaws or security threats resulting from the use of such technology and develop adequate protection measures. As a result, these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer. We must also attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products, particularly with respect to our digital services and solutions business and OpenBlue software platform. The laws and regulations applicable to our products, and our customers product and service needs, change from time to time, and regulatory changes may render our products and technologies noncompliant or result in new or enhanced regulatory scrutiny. In addition, the markets for our products, services and technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. The failure of our technology, products or services to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors, the introduction of new competitors to the market with new or innovative product offerings or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues, increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Failure to increase organizational effectiveness through the execution of our operating model and organizational improvements may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our business. 
 
 Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are dependent upon our ability to execute on our operating model and drive organizational improvement. We seek to develop and maintain a high-performance, customer centric culture and commercial organization characterized by continuous efficient and timely customer service, customer support, and customer intimacy enabling long-term customer loyalty. Our ability to successfully implement our operating model includes our ability to organize our operations around our commercial strategy through organizational improvements and implementing incentive programs that promote and reward the effective execution of our strategy. If we are unable to successfully implement and execute our operating model, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 
 We seek to drive organizational improvement through a variety of actions, including restructuring and integration activities, digital transformation, strategic initiatives, business portfolio reviews, productivity initiatives, functionalization, incentive programs, training, executive management changes, and business and operating model assessments. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company committed to a multi-year restructuring plan to address stranded costs and further right-size its global operations as a result of previously announced portfolio optimization transactions. The Company s ability to execute the most significant aspects of the restructuring plan will be dependent on the timing of the close of the R LC HVAC business divestiture transaction. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, including a delay in the completion of the R LC HVAC business divestiture, additional unexpected costs, loss of customer relationships, realization of fewer than 
 12 

estimated productivity improvements, increased change fatigue, organizational strain and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed, and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, our failure to effectively implement our operating model and manage organizational changes may lead to increased attrition of customers and employees and harm our ability to attract and retain key talent. 
 
 Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. 
 
 Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a high-performance, customer-centric and diverse management team and workforce. Continuous efficient and timely customer service, customer support and customer intimacy are essential to enabling customer loyalty and driving our financial results. Our growth strategies require that we pivot to new talent capability investments and build the workforce of the future, with an emphasis on developing skills in digital and consultative, outcome-based selling. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership and talent capacity with the necessary skillset and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives, execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership. Any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations. 
 
 The nature of our business requires us to maintain a labor force that is sufficiently large enough to support our manufacturing operations to meet customer demand, as well as provide on-site services and project support for our customers. This includes recruiting, hiring and retaining skilled trade workers to support our direct channel field businesses. We have in the past, and could in the future, experience shortages for skilled or unskilled labor. The impacts of such labor shortages could limit our ability to scale our operations to meet increased demand and convert backlog into revenue, which could negatively impact our growth and results of operations. 
 
 In July 2024, we announced that George Oliver, our Chief Executive Officer, had informed the Board of his plan to retire and requested that the Board initiate the Company s Chief Executive Officer succession plan. If we are unable to identify and retain a qualified successor for Mr. Oliver and successfully implement our Chief Executive Officer succession plan, then we could experience disruption in the setting and execution of our operational and strategic objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We also may have difficulty attracting and recruiting, or retaining, qualified senior leadership during the pendency of our search for a new Chief Executive Officer. 
 
 Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact our results. 
 
 Product and service quality issues could harm customer confidence in our company and our brands. If certain of our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding quality, safety or performance, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and we could be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks. In addition, when our products fail to perform as expected, we are exposed to warranty, product liability, personal injury and other claims. We have experienced such quality issues in the past and may experience such issues in the future. 
 
 We cannot be certain that our quality controls and procedures will reveal defects in our products or their raw materials, which may not become apparent until after the products have been placed in use in the market. Accordingly, there is a risk that products will have defects, which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance and require a product recall or field corrective action. Such remedial actions can be expensive to implement and may damage our reputation, customer relationships and market share. We have conducted product recalls and field corrective actions in the past and may do so again in the future. 
 
 In many jurisdictions, product liability claims are not limited to any specified amount of recovery. If any such claims or contribution requests or requirements exceed our available insurance or if there is a product recall, there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, a recall or claim could require us to review some or all of our product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other products, which could result in a significant disruption to our business and which could have a further adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability claims in the future, that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims or that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recall, repair and replacement costs. 
 
 13 

Cybersecurity incidents impacting our IT systems and digital products could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and materially and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. 
 
 We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT and data security infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new systems or integrate existing systems, they may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems, which are vulnerable to increased risks, including the risk of security breaches, system failures and disruptions, and implementing necessary upgrades. In addition, certain of our employees work remotely at times, which increases our vulnerability to cybersecurity and other IT risks. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system as a result of increased burdens placed on our IT infrastructure or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers, including cloud providers. These threats and incidents originate from many sources globally, including threats from sophisticated nation-state actors and organized criminal groups, and include malware in the form of computer viruses, ransomware, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, adware, scareware, rogue software, and programs that act against the computer user. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, IT systems or networks are constantly evolving and may not be recognized until launched against a target. We and third parties utilize vendors to support our business and operations have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, which add to the risks to our IT systems (including our cloud services providers systems), internal networks, our customers systems and the information that they store and process. In September 2023, we experienced a cybersecurity incident consisting of unauthorized access, data exfiltration and deployment of ransomware by a third party to a portion of our internal IT infrastructure. We have and may continue to incur significant costs in connection with the cybersecurity incident, including infrastructure investments or remediation efforts. The incident could also cause reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions and fines levied by governmental organizations, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. There can be no assurance that additional unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur or that we will not suffer material losses in the future. We could also experience similar consequences from future cybersecurity incidents. Other potential consequences could include the theft of intellectual property and the diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. 
 
 Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. We deploy countermeasures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate cybersecurity threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, monitoring of our IT networks and systems, maintenance of backup and protective systems and the incorporation of cybersecurity design throughout the lifecycle of our products. Despite these efforts, we have experienced, and will likely continue to experience, attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers , databases or systems. Cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, have resulted, and may in the future result, in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Such incidents have remained, and could in the future remain, undetected for an extended period of time, and the losses arising from such incidents could exceed our available insurance coverage for such matters. In addition, security breaches impacting our IT systems have in certain cases resulted in, and in the future could result in, a risk of loss or unauthorized disclosure or theft of information, which could lead to enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory or governmental audits, investigations and possible liability. 
 
 An increasing number of our products, services and technologies, including our OpenBlue software platform, are delivered with digital capabilities and accompanying interconnected device networks, which include sensors, data, building management systems and advanced computing and analytics capabilities. If we are unable to manage the lifecycle cybersecurity risk in development, deployment and operation of our digital platforms and services, they could become susceptible to cybersecurity incidents and lead to third-party claims that our product failures have caused damages to our customers. This risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products and the role they play in managing building systems. 
 
 14 

Data privacy, identity protection and information security compliance may require significant resources and presents certain risks. 
 
 We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, customer data, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, our business and our products may be vulnerable to security incidents, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or errors that could potentially lead to compromising such data, improper use of our products, systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. During September 2023, we experienced a cybersecurity event consisting of unauthorized access, data exfiltration and deployment of ransomware by a third party to a portion of our internal IT infrastructure. The actual or perceived risk of theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, employee or other data as a result of the cybersecurity incident, as well as non-compliance with applicable industry standards or our contractual or other legal obligations or privacy and information security policies regarding such data, could result in costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions. We could face similar consequences in the future if we, our suppliers, channel partners, customers or other third parties experience the actual or perceived risk of theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of data, including as a result of employee error or malfeasance, or as a result of the imaging, software, security and other products we incorporate into our products. Such an event could lead customers to select the products and services of our competitors. Both the cybersecurity incident and similar future incidents could harm our reputation, cause unfavorable publicity or otherwise adversely affect certain potential customers perception of the security and reliability of our services as well as our credibility and reputation, which could result in lost sales. 
 
 We operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, proposed regulations restricting the use of biometric security technology could impact the products and solutions offered by our security business. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. 
 
 Some of our contracts do not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. While we maintain general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions, such coverage might not be adequate or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of customer data, that such coverage will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We are incorporating artificial intelligence technologies into our products, services and processes. These technologies may present business, compliance and reputational risks. 
 
 Recent technological advances in artificial intelligence AI and machine-learning technology both present opportunities and pose risks to us. If we fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving technological developments in AI, our competitive position and business results may suffer. The introduction of these technologies, particularly generative AI, into internal processes and/or new and existing offerings may result in new or expanded risks and liabilities, including due to enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, compliance issues, ethical concerns, confidentiality or security risks, as well as other factors that could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial results. In addition, our personnel could, unbeknownst to us, improperly utilize AI and machine learning-technology while carrying out their responsibilities. The use of AI in the development of our products and services could also cause loss of intellectual property, as well as subject us to risks related to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, data privacy and cybersecurity. The use of artificial intelligence can lead to unintended consequences, including generating content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate, misleading or otherwise flawed, or that results in unintended biases and discriminatory outcomes, which could harm our reputation and business and expose us to risks related to inaccuracies or errors in the output of such technologies. We also face risks of competitive disadvantage if our competitors more effectively use AI to drive internal efficiencies or create new or enhanced products or services that we are unable to compete against. 

15 

Infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of third parties, could negatively affect us. 
 
 We rely on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, know-how, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology, trade secrets or know-how. For example, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate. While we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets, know-how, business strategy and other proprietary information, such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture or operation of our products. From time to time, we resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings can be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. For those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired, the product is generally open to competition. Products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 In addition, we are, from time to time, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. The litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties, and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position. Intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We rely on our global direct installation channel for a significant portion of our revenue. Failure to maintain and grow the installed base resulting from direct channel sales could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Unlike many of our competitors, we rely on a direct sales channel for a substantial portion of our revenue. The direct channel provides for the installation of fire and security solutions, and HVAC equipment manufactured by us. This represents a significant distribution channel for our products, creates a large installed base of our fire and security solutions and HVAC equipment, and creates opportunities for longer term service, monitoring, solutions and retrofit revenue over the lifecycle of the building. If we are unable to maintain or grow this installation business, whether due to changes in economic conditions, a failure to anticipate changing customer needs, a failure to introduce innovative or technologically advanced solutions, or for any other reason, our installation revenue could decline, which could in turn adversely impact our product pull-through and our ability to grow service, monitoring, solutions and retrofit revenue. 
 
 Global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business. 
 
 The effects of climate change create financial and operational risks to our business. For example, the effects of climate change could impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing, exacerbate existing risks to our supply chain and increase insurance and other operating costs. These factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and disruptions that could result in increased prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them. 
 
 Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change has resulted in more regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulations tend to target the global warming potential GWP of refrigerants, equipment energy efficiency, and the combustion of fossil fuels. Many of our products consume energy and use refrigerants. Regulations which seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions present a risk to our global products business, predominantly our HVAC business, if we do not adequately prepare and refresh our product portfolio. As a result, we have and may in the future be required to make increased research and development and other capital expenditures to meet new regulations and standards. Further, our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions or other environmental standards through regulation, market-based emissions policies or consumer preference that we may not be able to timely meet due to the required level of capital investment or technological advancement. While we have been committed to continuous improvements to our product portfolio to meet and exceed anticipated regulations and preferences, there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, that proposed regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will reflect our product development investments. 
 
 16 

There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Such regulatory uncertainty extends to incentives, which if discontinued, could adversely impact the demand for energy efficient buildings, and could increase costs of compliance. These factors may impact the demand for our products, obsolescence of our products and our results of operations. 
 
 Failure to achieve our public sustainability commitments could negatively affect our reputation and business. 
 
 As of the date of this filing, we have made several public commitments regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions, including commitments to achieve net zero carbon emissions for Scope 1 and 2 by 2040 and the establishment of science-based targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions from our operations and Scope 3, category 11 emissions from the use of sold products in the operations of our customers. Although we intend to meet these commitments, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational and capital costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved, or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. We may determine that it is in the best interest of our company and our shareholders to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current commitments based on economic, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If we are unable to meet these commitments, we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups and other stakeholders, which could adversely impact the perception of our brand and our products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, which could in turn adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The ability of suppliers to deliver raw materials, parts and components to our manufacturing facilities, and our ability to manufacture and deliver services without disruption, could affect our results of operations. 
 
 We use a wide range of materials (primarily steel, copper and aluminum) and components (including semiconductors and other electronic components) in the global production of our products, which come from numerous suppliers around the world. Because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers, we are subject to supply and pricing risk. Our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including supplier plant shutdowns or slowdowns, transportation delays, work stoppages, labor relations, labor shortages, global geopolitical instability, price inflation, governmental regulatory and enforcement actions, intellectual property claims against suppliers, financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy, information technology failures, and hazards such as fire, earthquakes, flooding, or other natural disasters. For example, during 2022 and 2023 we experienced the following supply chain issues, due to economic, political and other factors largely beyond our control: increased input material costs and component shortages; supply chain disruptions and delays and cost inflation. In addition, some of our subcontractors have experienced supply chain and labor disruptions, which have and could in the future impact our ability to timely complete projects and convert our backlog. Such disruptions have and could in the future interrupt our ability to manufacture or obtain certain products and components, thereby adversely impacting our ability to provide products to customers and realize expected profit margins. We could experience the reoccurrence of similar or new disruptions in the future, the effect of which will depend on our ability to successfully mitigate the impact of these disruptions. Any such disruption could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Material supply shortages and delays in deliveries, along with other factors such as price inflation, can also result in increased pricing. While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. The inability to timely convert our backlog due to supply chain disruptions subjects us to pricing risk due to cost inflation occurring between the generation of backlog and its conversion into revenue. If we are unable to effectively manage the impacts of price inflation and timely convert our backlog, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could materially and adversely be affected. 
 
 A material disruption of our operations due to catastrophic or geopolitical events, particularly at our monitoring and/or manufacturing facilities, could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 
 If our operations, particularly at our monitoring facilities and/or manufacturing facilities, were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, pandemics, climate change, cybersecurity incidents, power outages, fires, explosions, abrupt political change, armed conflict, terrorism, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes, labor shortages or other reasons, we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals, fill customer orders, convert our backlog, collect revenue and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers, which could adversely affect our financial performance. These events may also cause us to experience increased costs and reduced productivity. For 
 17 

example, our recent cybersecurity incident caused disruptions to our operations, adversely affecting our financial performance in early fiscal 2024. Further, the occurrence or reoccurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 Interruptions to production could increase our costs and reduce our sales. Any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders, which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition. We maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, cybersecurity insurance to mitigate losses resulting from cybersecurity incidents, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force. 
 
 We employ approximately 94,000 people worldwide. Approximately 23 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently, no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees or our employees generally, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor. Additionally, a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. Work stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products. 
 
 Risks Relating to Strategic Transactions 
 
 We may not realize the benefits of our ongoing efforts to simplify our portfolio. 
 
 We continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines. Recently, we have been engaged in a strategic evaluation of our non-core product lines, leading to the divestiture of our Air Distribution Technologies business and the entry into a definitive agreement to divest our R LC HVAC business. Divestitures such as these involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business. We may also experience unfavorable reaction to the divestiture by customers, competitors, suppliers and employees, making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships. Some divestitures, including the divestiture of our R LC HVAC business, are or may be dilutive to earnings and we may not be successful in executing restructurings and other actions to minimize or offset dilution. We may also fail to successfully complete divestitures, achieve the strategic objectives of divestitures or not realize such objectives within the expected time frame, including our objective to simplify our portfolio to be a pure-play provider of comprehensive solutions for commercial buildings. With respect to the R LC HVAC business divestiture, there can be no assurance whether and when the closing conditions will be satisfied or waived, and whether the strategic benefits and expected financial impact of the divestiture will be achieved. In addition, divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In the event we are unable to successfully divest a business or product line, we may be forced to wind down such business or product line, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot provide assurance as to whether we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line, and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may also result in a diversion of management attention, operational difficulties and losses. 
 
 We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or joint ventures. 
 
 We expect acquisitions of businesses and assets, as well as joint ventures (or other strategic arrangements), to play a role in our future growth and our ability to build capabilities in our products and services. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or joint venture targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or form joint ventures, or manage the timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our 
 18 

businesses. Competition for acquisition opportunities may rise, thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. 
 
 Acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrences, equity issuances, operating losses and expenses and may be dilutive to earnings. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including: the diversion of management attention to integration matters; difficulties in integrating operations and systems; challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures; difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel; challenges in successfully integrating and operating businesses with different characteristics than our current core businesses; challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects; contingent liabilities (including contingent tax liabilities and earn-out obligations) that are larger than expected; and potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with acquired companies. The goodwill and intangible assets recorded in past acquisitions were significant, and in future acquisitions could be significant, and impairment of such assets could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Risks associated with joint venture investments may adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 
 We have entered into several joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition, we may compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner s consent to take certain actions. Our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents, and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. Additionally, the financial performance of our joint ventures has resulted in, and in the future could result in, the Company having to record losses or impairments of our investment. These risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 
 
 Risks Related to Macroeconomic and Political Conditions 
 
 Some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and, accordingly, demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries. 
 
 Much of the demand for our products, services and solutions is driven by commercial, institutional, industrial, data center, governmental and residential construction, industrial facility expansion, retrofit activity, maintenance projects and other capital investments in buildings within the sectors that we serve. Construction and other capital investment projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions, localized demand for real estate and availability of credit , public funding or other sources of financing . Some of the real estate markets we serve are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand. In addition, most real estate developers rely heavily on project financing in order to initiate and complete projects. Declines in real estate values and increases in prevailing interest rates could lead to significant reductions in the demand for and availability of project financing, even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction. These factors could in turn temper demand for new building products and solutions and have a corresponding impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance are dependent on general economic conditions, economic conditions within specific industries we serve, expectations of future market behavior and available financing. The businesses of many of our industrial customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns. During such economic downturns, customers in these industries tend to delay major capital projects, including greenfield construction, maintenance projects and upgrades. Additionally, demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy, component and commodity prices, commodity and component availability and fluctuating demand forecasts, as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning, which may reduce demand for our products and services as projects are postponed or cancelled. Increases in prevailing interest rates or disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could significantly raise the cost of new debt for our customers. Any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a 
 19 

negative effect on investment in large capital projects, including necessary maintenance and upgrades, even during periods of favorable end-market conditions. 
 
 Many of our customers inside and outside of the industrial and commercial sectors, including governmental and institutional customers, have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue have been negatively impacted by adverse or stagnant economic conditions, including sustained increases in interest rates. These budgetary constraints have in the past, and may in the future, reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers. 
 
 Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs. This reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Risks associated with our non-U.S. operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We have significant operations in a number of countries outside the U.S., some of which are located in emerging markets. Long-term economic and geopolitical uncertainty in any of the regions of the world in which we operate, such as Asia, South America, the Middle East, Europe and emerging markets, could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect cash flows from our operations to cover our capital needs and debt service requirements. During fiscal year 2024, our results of operations were impacted by continued softening of economic conditions in China, negatively impacting the performance of the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment. The continuation of economic weakness in China or in other regions could adversely impact our financial performance in such regions, as well as our consolidated financial performance. 
 
 In addition, as a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are therefore subject to non-U.S. currency risks and non-U.S. exchange exposure. While we employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure, these activities do not insulate us completely from those exposures. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the U.S. and adversely impact the comparability of results from period to period. During 2022 through 2024, we experienced a reduction in revenue and profits as a result of the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. The continued strength of the U.S. dollar could continue to adversely impact our revenue and profit in non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
 
 There are other risks that are inherent in our non-U.S. operations, including the potential for changes in socio-economic conditions, laws and regulations, including anti-trust, labor and environmental laws, and monetary and fiscal policies; the ability to enforce rights, collect revenues and protect assets in foreign jurisdictions; protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures, or impact trade volumes; unsettled or unstable political conditions; international conflict; government-imposed plant or other operational shutdowns; backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions; corruption; natural and man-made disasters, hazards and losses; violence, civil and labor unrest, and possible terrorist attacks. These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 Changes in U.S. or foreign trade policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results. 
 
 Geopolitical tensions and trade disputes can disrupt supply chains and increase the cost of our products. This could cause our products to be more expensive for customers, which could reduce the demand for or attractiveness of such products. In addition, a geopolitical conflict in a region where we operate could disrupt our ability to conduct business operations in that region. Countries also could adopt restrictive trade measures, such as tariffs, laws and regulations concerning investments and limitations on foreign ownership of businesses, taxation, foreign exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations and the repatriation of earnings and controls on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, any of which could adversely affect our operations and supply chain and limit our ability to offer our products and services as intended. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials (either directly or through our suppliers) could have an impact on our competitive position, business operations and financial results. For example, the U.S., China and other countries continue to implement restrictive trade actions, including tariffs, export controls, sanctions, legislation favoring domestic investment and other actions impacting the import and export of goods, foreign investment and foreign operations in jurisdictions in which we operate. These kinds of restrictions could be adopted with little to no advanced notice, and we may not be able to effectively mitigate the adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty 
 20 

surrounding trade or other international disputes also could have a negative impact on customer confidence and willingness to spend money, which could impair our future growth. Any of these events could increase the cost of our products, create disruptions to our supply chain and impair our ability to effectively operate and compete in the countries where we do business. 
 
 Economic, political, credit and capital market conditions could adversely affect our financial performance, our ability to grow or sustain our business and our ability to access the capital markets. 
 
 We compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets. Global economic and political conditions affect each of our primary businesses and the businesses of our customers and suppliers. Recessions, economic downturns, price instability, inflation, slowing economic growth and social and political instability in the industries and/or markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance in future periods, result in future restructuring charges, and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our business. For example, recent and ongoing macroeconomic and political instability caused by rising interest rates, global supply chain disruptions, inflation, ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine as well as Israel and Hamas, geopolitical tensions and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have and could continue to adversely impact our results of operations. Other consequences arising from ongoing conflicts, the further escalation of geopolitical tensions globally and their effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted. This may include economic sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, expansion of current conflicts, energy instability, retaliatory action by governments, supply chain disruptions, disruption to local markets, increased cybersecurity attacks against us, our third-party service providers and customers, collateral consequences from cyber conflicts between nation-states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure. and increased tensions among countries in which we operate. Our failure to adequately react to these and other political and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 
 The capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our business beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide. A worldwide economic downturn and/or disruption of the credit markets could reduce our access to capital necessary for our operations and executing our strategic plan. In addition, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, increased capital costs due to increases in global interest rates. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, or if costs of capital increased significantly due to increased interest rates, lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors; then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 
 Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Increases in commodity costs can negatively impact the profitability of orders in backlog as prices on such orders are typically fixed; therefore, in the short-term, our ability to adjust for changes in certain commodity prices is limited. In these cases, if we are not able to recover commodity cost increases through price increases to our customers on new orders, then such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply-based fixed-price contracts, we use commodity hedge contracts to minimize overall price risk associated with our anticipated commodity purchases. Unfavourability in our hedging programs during a period of declining commodity prices could result in lower margins as we reduce prices to match the market on a fixed commodity cost level. Additionally, to the extent we do not or are unable to hedge certain commodities and the commodity prices substantially increase, such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 During fiscal 2022 and 2023, we at times experienced increased commodity costs as a result of global macroeconomic trends, including global price inflation, supply chain disruption and international conflict. We could experience further cost fluctuations in the future, which could negatively impact our results of operations to the extent we are unable to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of increased costs. 
 
 Risks Related to Government Regulations 
 
 Our businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations. 
 
 Our operations and employees are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local licensing laws, codes and standards and similar foreign laws, codes, standards and regulations. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses. Competition or other regulatory investigations can continue for several years, be costly to defend and can result in 
 21 

substantial fines. If laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 Due to the international scope of our operations, the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and various non U.S. governmental agencies, including applicable export controls, anti-trust, customs, currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations, laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets, and laws governing certain materials that may be in our products. No assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. 
 
 We are also subject to a complex network of tax laws and tax treaties that impact our effective tax rate. For more information on risks related to tax regulation, see Risks Related to Tax Matters below. 
 
 We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. 
 
 We are subject to requirements relating to environmental and safety regulations and environmental remediation matters which could adversely affect our business, results of operation and reputation. 
 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, solid and hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal, and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future, which could increase costs of compliance, decrease demand for our products, create reputational harm or require us to manufacture with alternative technologies and materials. For example, our Tyco Fire Protection Products business discontinued the production and sale of fluorinated firefighting foams in fiscal 2024, including Aqueous Film-Forming Foam ("AFFF") and related products, and has transitioned to non-fluorinated foam alternatives. 
 
 Federal, state and local authorities also regulate a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, health, safety laws governing employee injuries, and permitting requirements in addition to the environmental matters discussed above. If we are unable to adequately comply with applicable health and safety regulations and provide our employees with a safe working environment, we may be subject to litigation and regulatory action, in addition to negatively impacting our ability to attract and retain talented employees. New legislation and regulations may require us to make material changes to our operations, resulting in significant increases to the cost of production. Additionally, violations of environmental, health and safety laws are subject to civil, and, in some cases, criminal sanctions. As a result of these uncertainties, we may incur unexpected interruptions to operations, fines, penalties or other reductions in income which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws around the world. 
 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"), the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and require that companies maintain accurate books and records. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. We operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and local customs and practices that can be inconsistent with anti-bribery laws. We cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will preclude reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third-party intermediaries. Where we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, or if we are subject to allegations of any such violations, we have and will investigate the allegations and from time to time as necessary may engage outside counsel to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of such compliance matters, which also could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 22 

We are subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the U.S. government. 
 
 Our customers include many U.S. federal, state and local government authorities. Doing business with the U.S. federal, state and local governments subjects us to certain particular risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations. Agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for failure to perform under the applicable contract. We are subject to potential government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations, which can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation, we could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been made in the past that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that have moved their corporate location abroad. We are unable to predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business. 
 
 Risks Related to Litigation 
 
 Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. 
 
 We have projects underway at multiple current and former manufacturing and testing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties, including our Fire Technology Center and Stanton Street manufacturing facility located in Marinette, Wisconsin. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including arsenic, solvent, oil, metal, lead, PFOS, PFOA and/or other per- and polyfluorinated substances ("PFAS") and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and structure decontamination and demolition, including asbestos abatement. Governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating PFAS, which is contained in certain of the Company's legacy firefighting foam products. These regulations include declining emission standards and limits set as to the presence of certain compounds. Because of uncertainties associated with environmental regulation and environmental remediation activities at sites where we may be liable, future expenses that we may incur to remediate identified sites and resolve outstanding litigation could be considerably higher than the current accrued liability on our consolidated statements of financial position, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 In addition, we have been named, along with others, in a number of class action and other lawsuits relating to the use of fire-fighting foam products by the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. military and others for fire suppression purposes and related training exercises. It is difficult to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure represented by these matters. Such claims may also negatively affect our reputation. See Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters. 
 
 We are party to asbestos-related product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We and certain of our subsidiaries, along with numerous other third parties, are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. These cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture, sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components. We cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits on satisfactory terms in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief. Unfavorable rulings, judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters. 
 
 Legal proceedings in which we are, or may be, a party may adversely affect us. 
 
 We are currently, and may in the future, become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers, intellectual property matters, third party liability, including product liability claims, and employment claims. In addition, we may be exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions, or system failure, in our fire and security businesses than may not be inherent in other businesses. In particular, because many of our fire and security products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property, we may have greater exposure to 
 23 

litigation risks than other businesses. The nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures. As a result, such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Risks Related to Tax Matters 
 
 Future potential changes to the tax laws could adversely affect us and our affiliates. 
 
 Legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, which, if ultimately enacted, could result in an increase in our effective tax rate. For example, if the U.S or other jurisdictions override tax treaties upon which we rely, or broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a U.S. resident, each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals and such changes could have a prospective or retroactive application. However, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in Ireland or limiting Johnson Controls International plc s ability, as an Irish company, to take advantage of tax treaties with the U.S., we could be subject to increased taxation, potentially significant expense, and/or other adverse tax consequences. 
 
 In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD")/G20 inclusive framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Inclusive Framework) published a statement updating and finalizing the key components of a two-pillar plan on global tax reform which has now been agreed upon by the majority of OECD members. Pillar One allows countries to reallocate a portion of residual profits earned by multinational enterprises ("MNE"), with an annual global revenue exceeding 20 billion and a profit margin over 10 , to other market jurisdictions. The adoption of Pillar One and its potential effective date remain uncertain. Pillar Two requires MNEs with an annual global revenue exceeding 750 million to pay a global minimum tax of 15 . The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. A number of countries, including Ireland, have enacted legislation to implement the core elements of Pillar Two, which will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2025. We are continuing to evaluate the impact on future periods of Pillar Two, including legislative updates and adoption by additional countries, which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate. 
 
 Future potential changes to the U.S. tax laws could result in us being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") may not agree that we should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. 
 
 Because Johnson Controls International plc is organized under the laws of Ireland, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, Section 7874 of the Code ("Section 7874") provides an exception to this general rule under which a non-U.S. incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. The IRS may assert that, as a result of the Merger, Johnson Controls International plc should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS may also assert that the ability of our U.S. affiliates to utilize U.S. tax attributes, such as net operating losses and certain tax credits, to offset U.S. taxable income resulting from certain transactions may be limited under Section 7874. The application of these rules could result in significant additional U.S. tax liability. In addition, a retroactive change to U.S. tax laws in this area could change the tax classification of Johnson Controls International plc. If it were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for federal tax purposes, we could be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation. 
 
 Based on the terms of the Merger, we currently expect that Section 7874 does not apply to us or our affiliates as a result of the Merger. However, determining the applicability of Section 7874 is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties. Thus, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the position that Johnson Controls International plc should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes or that Section 7874 does not otherwise apply. 
 
 Changes to the U.S. model income tax treaty could adversely affect us. 
 
 On February 17, 2016, the U.S. Treasury released a revised U.S. model income tax convention (the "new model"), which is the baseline text used by the U.S. Treasury to negotiate tax treaties. If any or all of the modifications to the model treaty are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business, they could, among other things, cause double taxation, increase audit risk and substantially increase our worldwide tax liability. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific modifications to the model treaty, and we cannot provide assurance that any such modifications will not apply to us. 
 
 24 

Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to additional changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on our statement of financial position, and the future sale of certain businesses could potentially result in the reversal of outside basis differences that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, changes in tax laws in the U.S., Ireland or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position and our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of income. 
 
 We are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities. Negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation 
 
 Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. 
 
 It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland. 
 
 As an Irish company, Johnson Controls is governed by the Irish Companies Acts, which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of Johnson Controls International plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S. 
 
 Transfers of Johnson Controls ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty. 
 
 For the majority of transfers of Johnson Controls ordinary shares, there is no Irish stamp duty. However, Irish stamp duty is payable for certain share transfers. A transfer of Johnson Controls ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially (i.e., through the Depository Trust Company ("DTC")) to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially is not subject to Irish stamp duty (unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares). A transfer of Johnson Controls ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly (i.e., not through DTC) to any buyer, or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly, may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer. A shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to Johnson Controls transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and, at the time of the transfer, there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares. 
 
 We currently intend to pay, or cause one of our affiliates to pay, stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially. In other cases, Johnson Controls may, in its absolute discretion, pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty. Johnson Controls Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that, in the event of any such payment, Johnson Controls (i) may seek reimbursement from the buyer, (ii) may have a lien against the Johnson Controls ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and (iii) may set-off the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares. Parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in Johnson Controls ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by Johnson Controls. 
 
 25 

Dividends paid by us may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax. 
 
 In certain circumstances, as an Irish tax resident company, we will be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 25 from dividends paid to our shareholders. Shareholders that are residents in the U.S., European Union countries (other than Ireland) or other countries with which Ireland has signed a tax treaty (whether the treaty has been ratified or not) generally should not be subject to Irish withholding tax so long as the shareholder has provided certain Irish dividend withholding tax forms. However, some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares. 
 
 Dividends received by investors could be subject to Irish income tax. 
 
 Dividends paid in respect of Johnson Controls ordinary shares generally are not subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax, unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Johnson Controls. 
 
 Johnson Controls shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Johnson Controls. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 
 The potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 
 We are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services, or who purchase goods and services from us, will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress. If third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us, we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us. In such events, we may incur losses, or our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected. 
 
 Risks related to our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. 
 
 Significant changes in actual investment return on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates, mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and the amounts of contributions we must make to our defined benefit plans in future periods. Because we mark-to-market our defined benefit plan assets and liabilities on an annual basis, large non-cash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when a remeasurement event occurs. Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for our defined benefit plans are dependent upon, among other factors, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations. 
 
 A variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our business. 
 
 Any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our business: loss of, changes in, or failure to perform under guaranteed performance contracts with our major customers; cancellation of, or significant delays in, projects in our backlog; delays or difficulties in new product development; our ability to recognize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions, downgrades in the ratings of our debt, material increases to our level of indebtedness, products and services that we are unable to pass on to the market; changes in energy costs or governmental regulations that would decrease the incentive for customers to update or improve their building control systems; and natural or man-made disasters or losses that impact our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. 

ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
 
 The Company has no unresolved written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC.

ITEM 1C CYBERSECURITY 
 
 Cybersecurity Strategy and Risk Management 
 
 The Company faces a wide variety of cybersecurity threats ranging from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology ("IT") systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the Company, its products, its customers, supply chain and/or its third-party service providers, including cloud providers. These threats and incidents originate from many sources globally. 
 
 The Company s cybersecurity policies, standards, and procedures apply to all users, creating awareness of threats and the importance of information security and cybersecurity across the Company s workforce. The policies and standards were created using elements of recognized standards such as ISO 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for the overall enterprise and ISA/IEC 62443 for automation and control system products. The Company has implemented cybersecurity policies throughout its operations, including designing and incorporating cybersecurity into the development process for its products and services. The Company s enterprise risk management ERM process considers cybersecurity threat risks alongside other significant risks as part of the Company s overall risk assessment process. 
 
 The Company leverages multiple channels to promote cybersecurity topics, deliver targeted initial and refresher training for all users, and conduct an annual mandatory global information security training campaign with certification, which is translated into 20 languages, and ongoing awareness campaigns. These elements are designed to maintain a risk aware culture. 
 
 The Company maintains a 24 x 7 operations center that monitors the Company s IT environment, and coordinates the investigation and remediation of alerts. As cybersecurity events occur, the cybersecurity team focuses on responding to and containing the threat and minimizing impact. In the event of an incident, the cybersecurity team assesses, among other factors, supply chain and manufacturing disruption, data and personal information loss, business operations disruption, projected cost and potential for reputational harm, with participation from technical, legal and law enforcement support, as appropriate. 
 
 The Company s vulnerability management program conducts assessments with specified frequencies for specific asset types to validate system health against known threats. The Company leverages multiple tools, which are routinely updated with new threat signatures, to continually respond to evolving threats identified as part of its threat detection capability. The Company also maintains a cybersecurity insurance policy. 
 
 The Company engages with third parties to perform security assessments of its technology environment to perform penetration testing and maturity assessment as well as providing services to support threat analysis and incident detection and response. 
 
 Cybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of the Company s third-party product and service providers. The Company performs due diligence on third parties that have access to its critical systems and data and whose products and services are integrated into the Company s products. Contractual undertakings and oversight are put in place, based on the results of the risk assessment to manage and reduce the cybersecurity risk associated with such third-party providers. Such undertakings may include requirements to comply with administrative, technical and physical safeguards to provide notification of cyber incidents involving the Company s systems or data and agreements to be subject to cybersecurity audits, which the Company conducts as appropriate . The Company requires compliance with appropriate certifications (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.) depending on the offering, region of use, and other factors. 
 
 During the weekend of September 23, 2023, the Company experienced a cybersecurity incident impacting its internal IT infrastructure and applications. The incident caused disruptions and limitation of access to portions of the Company's business applications supporting aspects of the Company's operations and corporate functions. The impact of the incident included lost and deferred revenues, primarily attributable to order processing and logistics disruptions and delays, and expenses associated with the response to, and remediation of, the incident. Further, the cybersecurity incident caused disruptions to certain of the Company s billing systems, which negatively impacted cash provided from continuing operations primarily during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The overall impact of the cybersecurity incident did not have a material impact on net income, net of insurance recoveries, or cash flows from operations for the full year fiscal 2024. 
 
 Cybersecurity Governance 
 
 The Company s Board of Directors (the "Board has oversight of the management of the most significant risks facing the Company, including cybersecurity. The Board receives information technology and cybersecurity updates from senior management, including the Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer CISO and Chief Technology Officer, several times per year. These updates cover the cybersecurity risks facing the Company s enterprise information 
 27 

technology environment, as well as the Company s digital products and services. Regular oversight of cybersecurity matters is further delegated by the Board to the Governance and Sustainability Committee. The Governance and Sustainability Committee provides a deeper level of oversight through quarterly engagements with senior management, including the Chief Information Officer and CISO, to review the Company s cybersecurity program, including the highest risk areas and key mitigation strategies. 
 
 The Company maintains a Cybersecurity Steering Committee ("CSC") designed to ensure effective governance of risks associated with the Company s use of information and technology assets and demonstrate effective governance of cybersecurity risk. The CSC is chaired by the CISO, and includes the Company s Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Information Officer, and other senior representatives from the Company s business segments and functions. The CSC meets quarterly to monitor the current risk landscape and active risk reduction efforts. Through this review and monitoring activity, the CSC oversees effective governance of IT Risk Management in the Enterprise IT Portfolio, drives accountability and transparency of control effectiveness, and facilitates risk remediation and mitigation in a coordinated and comprehensive manner. 
 
 The CISO is appointed by the Chief Information Officer and is responsible for cybersecurity risk management across the Company. The CISO leads a global enterprise security team responsible for enterprise-wide security strategy, architecture, engineering, and operations. The Cybersecurity Steering Committee has granted authority to the CISO to pause or stop business processes during the execution of cybersecurity incident response duties if they deem it necessary. The CSC maintains approval authority for the Company s Enterprise Information Security Policy. The CISO has over 20 years of technology experience including cybersecurity, infrastructure, architecture, and data and analytics in highly regulated industries including healthcare and aviation and defense. The CISO has an undergraduate degree in Computer Information Systems . 

ITEM 2 PROPERTIES 
 
 The Company has properties in over 60 countries throughout the world, with its world headquarters located in Cork, Ireland and its North American operational headquarters located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin USA. The Company s wholly- and majority-owned facilities primarily consist of manufacturing, sales and service offices, research and development facilities, monitoring centers, and assembly and/or warehouse centers. At September 30, 2024, properties related to continuing operations totaled approximately 24 million square feet of floor space of which 6 million square feet are owned and 18 million square feet are leased. The Company considers its facilities to be suitable for their current uses and adequate for current needs. The majority of the facilities are operating at normal levels based on capacity. The Company does not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. 

ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Gumm v. Molinaroli, et al. 
 
 In May 2024, stockholders of Johnson Controls, Inc., filed a putative class action Complaint against Johnson Controls, Inc., certain former officers and directors of Johnson Controls, Inc., and two related entities (Jagara Merger Sub LLC and Johnson Controls International plc) in Wisconsin state court relating to the 2016 merger of Johnson Controls and Tyco (Gumm et al. v. Molinaroli et al., Case No. 30106, filed May 23, 2024 in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin).

 The Company's fiscal year ends on September 30. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years. This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity of the Company on a continuing operations basis for the year ended September 30, 2024 and should be read in conjunction with Item 8, the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Macroeconomic Trends 
 
 Much of the demand for the Company s products and solutions is driven by construction, facility expansion, retrofit and maintenance projects within the commercial, institutional, industrial, data center, governmental and residential sectors. Construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions, localized demand for real estate and the availability of credit, public funding or other financing sources. Positive or negative fluctuations in construction, industrial facility expansion, retrofit activity, maintenance projects and other capital investments in buildings within the sectors that the Company serves, as well as availability of credit, financing or funding for such projects, could have a corresponding impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. During fiscal 2024, the Company observed continued softening of economic conditions in China, negatively impacting the performance of the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment. The Company expects economic conditions in China to stabilize in fiscal 2025, however, if conditions do not stabilize, results of the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment could be negatively impacted. 
 
 As a result of the Company s global presence, a significant portion of its revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company is therefore subject to non-U.S. currency risks and non-U.S. exchange exposure. While the Company employs financial instruments to hedge some of its transactional foreign exchange exposure, these activities do not insulate it completely from those exposures. In addition, the currency exposure from the translation of non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries are not able to be hedged. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could increase or reduce the Company s profit margin, respectively, and impact the comparability of results from period to period. During fiscal 2024, revenue and profits were negatively impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. 
 
 The Company continues to observe trends demonstrating increased interest and demand for its products and services that enable smart, safe, efficient and sustainable buildings, particularly within verticals including data centers, government, healthcare and higher education. This demand is driven in part by capital investment, government tax incentives, building performance standards and regulations designed to limit emissions and combat climate change. In particular, legislative and regulatory initiatives such as the U.S. Climate Smart Buildings Initiative, U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive include provisions designed to fund and encourage investment in decarbonization and digital technologies for buildings. This demand is supplemented by an increase in commitments in both the public and private sectors to reduce emissions and/or achieve net zero emissions. The Company seeks to capitalize on these trends to drive growth by developing 
 32 

and delivering technologies and solutions to create smart, sustainable and healthy buildings. The Company is investing in new digital and product capabilities, including its OpenBlue platform, to enable it to deliver sustainable, high-efficiency products and tailored services to enable customers to achieve their objectives. The Company is leveraging its install base, together with data-driven products and services to offer outcome-based solutions to customers with a focus on generating accelerated growth in services and recurring revenue. 
 
 The Company has experienced, and could continue to experience, increased material cost inflation and component shortages, as well as disruptions and delays in its supply chain, as a result of global macroeconomic trends, including increased global demand, geopolitical and economic tensions, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, and labor shortages. Actions taken by the Company to mitigate supply chain disruptions and inflation, including expanding and redistributing its supplier network, supplier financing, price increases and productivity improvements, have historically been successful in offsetting some, but not all, of the impact of these trends. The collective impact of these trends has been favorable to revenue due to increased demand and price increases to offset inflation, while negatively impacting margins primarily due to ongoing cost pressures. Although the Company has experienced recent stabilization, it could experience further disruptions, and shortages and cost increases could occur in the future, the effect of which will depend on the Company s ability to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of these events. 
 
 The extent to which the Company s results of operations and financial condition are impacted by these and other factors in the future will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. See Part I, Item 1A, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of risks. 
 
 Portfolio Simplification Transactions 
 
 The Company has been engaged in an ongoing evaluation of its non-core product lines in connection with its objective to be a pure-play provider of comprehensive solutions for commercial buildings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Air Distribution Technologies business included within the Global Products segment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Residential and Light Commercial ("R LC") HVAC business to Robert Bosch GmbH Bosch for approximately 8.1 billion in cash with the Company's portion of the aggregate consideration being approximately 6.7 billion, inclusive of an upfront royalty payment for the licensing of the York tradename. The R LC HVAC business includes the Company's North America Ducted business and Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning Holding (UK) Ltd., the Company s global residential joint venture with Hitachi Global Life Solutions, Inc. Hitachi ), of which the Company owns 60 and Hitachi owns 40 . The R LC HVAC business, which was previously reported in the Global Products segment, meets the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and, as a result, its historical financial results are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation, and assets and liabilities were reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented. The Company expects that the sale of the R LC HVAC business will close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 
 Cybersecurity Incident 
 
 During the weekend of September 23, 2023, the Company experienced a cybersecurity incident impacting its internal information technology ("IT") infrastructure and applications. The cybersecurity incident consisted of unauthorized access, data exfiltration and deployment of ransomware by a third party to a portion of the Company's internal IT infrastructure. The incident caused disruptions and limitation of access to portions of the Company's business applications supporting aspects of the Company's operations and corporate functions, which disruptions and limitations continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 The Company s investigation and remediation efforts remain ongoing, including the analysis of data accessed, exfiltrated or otherwise impacted during the cybersecurity incident. Based on the information reviewed to date, the Company has not observed evidence of any impact to its digital products, services and solutions, including OpenBlue and Metasys. 
 
 The overall impact of the cybersecurity incident did not have a material impact on net income, net of insurance recoveries, or cash flows from operations in fiscal 2024. 
 
 The Company maintains insurance covering certain losses associated with cybersecurity incidents. A substantial portion of direct costs incurred related to containing, investigating and remediating the incident, as well as business interruption losses, have been or are expected to be reimbursed through insurance recoveries. The timing of recognizing insurance recoveries may differ from the timing of recognizing the associated expenses.

Restructuring and Cost Optimization Initiatives 
 
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company committed to a multi-year restructuring plan to address stranded costs and further right-size its global operations as a result of previously announced portfolio simplification actions. It is expected that one-time restructuring costs, including severance and other employee termination benefits, contract termination costs, and certain other related cash and non-cash charges, of approximately 400 million will be incurred over the course of fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027, resulting in expected annual cost savings of approximately 500 million upon full completion of the plan. The Company s ability to execute the most significant aspects of the restructuring plan will be dependent on the timing of the close of the R LC HVAC business divestiture transaction. Accordingly, the Company is unable to estimate the specific costs to be incurred and savings to be achieved in fiscal 2025; however, depending on the timing of the closing of the transaction and the ability to execute more significant aspects of the planned restructuring actions, the impact of costs on net income could be material in fiscal 2025. Restructuring costs will be incurred across all segments and Corporate functions.

 Measure not meaningful 
 
 The fiscal 2024 effective tax rate was higher than fiscal 2023 primarily due to the establishment of a deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference of the Company s investment in certain subsidiaries as a result of the planned divestiture of its R LC HVAC business, partially offset by lower tax reserve adjustments as the result of tax audit resolutions and expired statute of limitations for certain tax years, valuation allowance adjustments and the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives. Refer to Note 18, "Income Taxes," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 
 In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD")/G20 inclusive framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Inclusive Framework) published a statement updating and finalizing the key components of a two-pillar plan on global tax reform which has now been agreed upon by the majority of OECD members. Pillar One allows countries to reallocate a portion of residual profits earned by multinational enterprises ("MNE"), with an annual global revenue exceeding 20 billion and a profit margin over 10 , to other market jurisdictions. The adoption of Pillar One and its potential effective date remain uncertain. Pillar Two requires MNEs with an annual global revenue exceeding 750 million to pay a 
 35 

global minimum tax of 15 . The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. A number of countries, including Ireland, have enacted legislation to implement the core elements of Pillar Two, which will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2025. The Company continues to evaluate the impact on future periods of Pillar Two, including legislative updates and adoption by additional countries, which could result in an increase to the effective tax rate.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Working Capital 
 September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Change Current assets 11,179 10,737 Current liabilities (11,955) (11,084) (776) (347) Less: Cash and cash equivalents (606) (828) Add: Short-term debt 953 361 Add: Current portion of long-term debt 536 645 Less: Current assets held for sale (1,595) (1,552) Add: Current liabilities held for sale 1,431 1,375 Working capital (as defined) (57) (346) Accounts receivable - net 6,051 5,494 10 Inventories 1,774 1,872 (5) Accounts payable 3,389 3,498 (3) 
 Measure not meaningful 
 
 The Company defines working capital as current assets less current liabilities, excluding cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, the current portion of long-term debt, and current assets and liabilities held for sale (when applicable). Management believes that this measure of working capital, which excludes financing-related items and businesses to be divested, provides a more useful measurement of the Company s operating performance. 
 
 The increase in working capital (as defined) at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to discontinuing the receivable factoring program during the current year, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue and accrued compensation and benefits. 

Cash Flows From Continuing Operations 
 Year Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Cash provided by operating activities 1,568 1,856 Cash used by investing activities (184) (1,093) Cash used by financing activities (1,948) (2,059) 
 
 The decrease in cash provided by operating activities reflects lower net income and the impact of higher accounts receivable and other asset balances, which was partially offset by the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities payments. 
 
 The decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to the net impact of proceeds from the ADTi divestiture in fiscal 2024 and cash paid for the FM:Systems acquisition in fiscal 2023. Refer to Note 2, "Acquisitions and Divestitures," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure related to acquisitions and divestitures. 
 
 The decrease in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to changes in short- and long-term borrowing activity and stock repurchase activity. The net impact of debt proceeds and repayments generated cash of 405 million 
 40 

in fiscal 2024 and used cash of 457 million in fiscal 2023. This increase in cash used was substantially offset by higher stock repurchases. 

Capitalization 
 September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Short-term debt 953 361 Current portion of long-term debt 536 645 Long-term debt 8,004 7,818 Total debt 9,493 8,824 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 606 828 Net debt 8,887 7,996 Shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls ("Equity") 16,098 16,545 Total capitalization (Total debt plus Equity) 25,591 25,369 Net capitalization (Net debt plus Equity) 24,985 24,541 Total net debt as a of Total capitalization 34.7 31.5 Total net debt as a of Net capitalization 35.6 32.6 
 
 Net debt and net debt as a percentage of total capitalization are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the percentage of total net debt to total capitalization is useful to understanding the Company s financial condition as it provides a view of the extent to which the Company relies on external debt financing for its funding and is a measure of risk to its shareholders. 
 
 The Company's material cash requirements primarily consist of working capital requirements, repayments of long-term debt and related interest, operating leases, dividends, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and share repurchases. 
 
 Refer to Note 10, "Debt and Financing Arrangements," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on debt obligations and maturities.

The Company expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time depending on market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and economic environment. 
 
 The Company declared dividends of 1.48 per share in fiscal 2024 and intends to continue paying quarterly dividends in fiscal 2025. 
 
 The Company believes its capital resources and liquidity position, including cash and cash equivalents of 606 million at September 30, 2024, are adequate to fund operations and meet its obligations for the foreseeable future. The Company expects requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, minimum pension contributions, 
 41 

debt maturities and any potential acquisitions or stock repurchases in fiscal 2025 will be funded from operations, supplemented by short- and long-term borrowings, if required. 
 
 The Company manages its short-term debt position in the U.S. and euro commercial paper markets and bank loan markets. Commercial paper outstanding was 350 million as of September 30, 2024 and 200 million as of September 30, 2023.

The Company anticipates that the proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchases of ordinary shares, dividends, capital expenditures and investments in the Company's subsidiaries. 
 
 The Company has the ability to draw on its syndicated 2.5 billion committed revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2028, and a syndicated 500 million committed revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2024. There were no draws on the facilities as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company's ability to access the global capital markets and the related cost of financing is dependent upon, among other factors, the Company's credit ratings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's credit ratings and outlook were as follows: 
 Rating Agency Short-Term Rating Long-Term Rating Outlook S P A-2 BBB+ Stable Moody's P-2 Baa2 Positive 
 
 The security ratings set forth above are issued by unaffiliated third-party rating agencies and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization at any time. 
 
 The Company entered into the following debt transactions in fiscal 2024: 
 
 Repaid 924 million of debt including the following: 
 484 million Senior Notes due 2024 with interest rates of 3.625 
 300 million term loans with interest rates of Euro Interbank Offered Rate (" EURIBOR") plus 0.4 to 0.7 
 Tendered 119 million of its Notes due 2045 with an interest rate of 5.125 
 
 Issued 1.3 billion of debt including the following: 
 Together with its wholly owned subsidiary, Tyco Fire Security Finance S.C.A., co-issued 700 million in 5.50 Senior Notes due in April 2029 
 450 million short-term term loans with interest rates of EURIBOR plus 0.65 to 0.78 due in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 
 100 million short-term term loan with an interest rate of 5.9 which is due in December 2024 
 
 The Company expects to receive net cash proceeds related to the sale of its R LC HVAC business of approximately 5.0 billion after tax and transaction-related expenses when the transaction closes, likely in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Consistent with its capital allocation policy, the Company expects to use a portion of the proceeds to pay down debt to the extent required to retain its investment grade rating, with the remaining proceeds expected to be returned to shareholders through share repurchases. 
 
 On April 12, 2024, Tyco Fire Products agreed to a settlement with a nationwide class of public water systems that detected PFAS in their drinking water systems that they allege to be associated with the use of AFFF. Under the terms of the agreement, Tyco Fire Products agreed to contribute 750 million to resolve these PFAS claims. Tyco Fire Products contributed an initial payment of 250 million in June 2024, with the remaining 500 million due by the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Prior to the date of the final contribution, Tyco Fire Products has agreed to contribute any applicable insurance recoveries in excess of the initial 250 million payment, up to the remaining 500 million due, within a specified period following the receipt of such recovery. During fiscal 2024, the Company recorded expected insurance recoveries of 371 million in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and collected insurance recoveries of 349 million. In accordance with its agreement and recent insurance 
 42 

recovery, Tyco Fire Products made an additional payment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 of approximately 85 million, reducing its final payment to approximately 415 million. The amounts and timing of any additional insurance recoveries are uncertain. Refer to Note 21, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the water systems settlement. 
 
 Financial covenants in the Company's revolving credit facilities require a minimum consolidated shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls of at least 3.5 billion at all times. The revolving credit facility also limits the amount of debt secured by liens that may be incurred to a maximum aggregated amount of 10 of consolidated shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls for liens and pledges. For purposes of calculating these covenants, consolidated shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls is calculated without giving effect to (i) the application of ASC 715-60, "Defined Benefit Plans - Other Postretirement," or (ii) the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants set forth in its credit agreements and the indentures governing its outstanding notes, and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future. None of the Company s debt agreements limit access to stated borrowing levels or require accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease in the Company's credit rating. 
 
 The Company earns a significant amount of its income outside of the parent company. Outside basis differences in these subsidiaries are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested except in limited circumstances. However, in fiscal 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense related to a change in the Company's assertion over the outside basis differences of the Company s investment in certain subsidiaries as a result of the planned divestiture of its R LC HVAC business. The Company currently does not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate undistributed earnings included in the outside basis differences other than in tax efficient manners. The Company's intent is to reduce basis differences only when it would be tax efficient. The Company expects existing U.S. cash and liquidity to continue to be sufficient to fund the Company s U.S. operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In the U.S., should the Company require more capital than is generated by its operations, the Company could elect to raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. The Company has borrowed funds in the U.S. and continues to have the ability to borrow funds in the U.S. at reasonable interest rates. In addition, the Company expects existing non-U.S. cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund the Company s non-U.S. operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Should the Company require more capital at the Luxembourg and Ireland holding and financing entities, other than amounts that can be provided in tax efficient methods, the Company could also elect to raise capital through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution of the Company s earnings. 
 
 The Company may from time to time purchase its outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Purchases or retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

 The same accounting policies as described in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements are used by the Parent Company and each of its subsidiaries in connection with the summarized financial information presented above. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following estimates are considered by management to be the most critical to the understanding of the Company's consolidated financial statements as they require significant judgments that could materially impact the Company s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 

Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company recognizes revenue from certain long-term contracts on an over time basis, with progress towards completion measured using a cost-to-cost input method based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Total estimated costs at completion are based primarily on estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Factors that may result in a change to these estimates include unforeseen engineering problems, construction delays, cost inflation, the performance of subcontractors and major material suppliers, and weather conditions. As a result, changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract. Such estimates are reviewed monthly and any adjustments to the measure of completion are recognized as adjustments to sales and gross profit using the cumulative catch-up method. Estimated losses are recorded when identified. 
 
 For agreements with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. In order to estimate relative standalone selling price, market data and transfer price studies are utilized. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach or expected cost plus margin approach. 
 
 The Company assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price, including discounts, rebates, refunds, credits or other similar sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of 
 44 

revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved. These estimates are based on the amount of consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to. 

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 
 The Company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units, which have been determined to be the Company s operating segments or one level below the operating segments, using a qualitative assessment or a quantitative test. A qualitative assessment is performed when prior quantitative assessments have resulted in significant excess of fair value over the carrying value of a reporting unit, and consideration of qualitative factors allow the Company to conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit remains greater than its carrying value. When performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To estimate the fair value, the Company uses a discounted cash flow model or estimated sales price for reporting units held for sale. The assumptions included in the impairment tests require judgment, and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculations. The key assumptions used in the impairment test were management's projections of future cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital and long-term growth rates. Although the Company's cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying business, there are significant judgments in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. 
 
 Management completed its fiscal 2024 annual impairment test as of July 31, which included a qualitative assessment of all but one of its reporting units. The Company did not identify any qualitative factors that suggest that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying amount, including goodwill, and as such, a quantitative impairment test was not necessary. The Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test of one reporting unit in the Building Solutions EMEA/LA segment with 214 million of goodwill, and its fair value was in excess of its carrying value. However, for this reporting unit, a 200 basis point increase in the discount rate, or a 200 basis point decrease in the revenue growth rates, would cause the fair value to be less than the carrying value. While no impairment was recorded, it is possible that future changes in circumstances could result in a non-cash impairment charge. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as a result of a triggering event and impaired 230 million of goodwill in its Building Solutions EMEA/LA segment. 
 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets are also subject to at least annual impairment testing in the fourth fiscal quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks and trade names and are tested for impairment using a relief-from-royalty method. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests. The key assumptions used in the impairment tests were long-term revenue growth projections, weighted-average cost of capital, and the royalty rate. The assumptions included in the impairment tests require judgment, and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculations. 
 
 The Company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value. While the Company believes the judgments and assumptions used in the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests are reasonable, different assumptions or changes in general industry, market and macro-economic conditions could change the estimated fair values and, therefore, future impairment charges could be required, which could be material to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Refer to Note 8, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the results of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing performed in fiscal 2024 and 2023. 

Pension Plans 
 
 The Company provides a range of benefits, including pensions, to eligible active and former employees. Pension plan assets and obligations are measured annually, or more frequently if there is a significant remeasurement event, using various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, assumed rates of return and compensation increases as of that date. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. 
 
 The Company considers expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis when estimating discount rates. Different discount rates are used for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction and the expected timing of benefit payments. The Company uses country-specific discount rates determined by an independent third party which are based on government and high-quality corporate bond yields. 
 45 

In estimating the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers historical returns on plan assets, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, inflation assumptions, asset mix and the impact of the active management of the plans invested assets. For fiscal 2025, the Company believes the long-term rate of return will approximate 6.50 for U.S. pension plans and 5.44 for non-U.S. pension plans. Any differences between actual investment results and the expected long-term asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a significant remeasurement event. If actual returns on plan assets are less than the Company s expectations, additional contributions may be required. 
 
 Based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, the Company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable, however, changes in these assumptions could impact the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The following chart illustrates the estimated increases (decreases) in projected benefit obligation and future ongoing pension expense, excluding any potential mark-to-market adjustments, assuming an increase of 25 basis points in the key assumptions used for the Company's pension plans (in millions): 
 
 Pension Benefits U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Change in Projected Benefit Obligation Change in Ongoing Pension Expense Change in Projected Benefit Obligation Change in Ongoing Pension Expense Discount rate (28) 2 (40) 1 Expected return on plan assets (4) (3) 

Loss Contingencies 
 
 Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, environmental matters, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. 
 
 The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. It is difficult to estimate the Company s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved, the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties, the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted, the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment, the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites, and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur. It is possible that technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the results of additional environmental studies or other factors could change the Company's expectations with respect to future charges and cash outlays, and such changes could be material to the Company's future results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Nevertheless, the Company does not currently believe that any claims, penalties or costs in addition to the amounts accrued will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 21, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities. The determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience. The Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. The Company maintains captive insurance companies to manage its insurable liabilities. 

Asbestos-Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables 
 
 The Company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. The Company's estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on the Company's historical claim experience, and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed and is discounted to present values from the time that the costs are expected to be incurred which in some cases is not until 2068 (which is the Company's reasonable best estimate of the actuarial determined time period through which asbestos-related claims will be filed against Company affiliates). Estimated asbestos-related defense costs are included in the asbestos liability. The Company's legal strategy for 
 46 

resolving claims also impacts these estimates. The Company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time (the look-back period) over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made through 2068. At least annually, the Company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed, settled and dismissed, and amounts paid in settlements. In addition to claims and settlement experience, the Company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation, the legal environment, and the Company's defense strategy. The Company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on an annual basis. The Company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted. 
 
 In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, the Company records asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are probable. The Company's estimate of asbestos-related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the Company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims discounted to present value. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, the Company considers available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers. Refer to Note 21, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on management's judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestos-related assets and liabilities. 

Income Taxes 
 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents non-U.S. operating and other loss carryforwards for which realization is uncertain. Management judgment is required in determining the Company s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against the Company s net deferred tax assets. 
 
 The Company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Company s valuation allowances may be necessary. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a valuation allowance of 6.3 billion for continuing operations, of which 5.9 billion relates to net operating and capital loss carryforwards primarily in France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, and the United Kingdom for which sustainable taxable income has not been demonstrated; and 0.4 billion for other deferred tax assets. 
 
 The Company s federal income tax returns and certain non-U.S. income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under various stages of audit by the IRS and respective non-U.S. tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. At September 30, 2024, the Company had recorded a liability of 2.1 billion for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions, the majority of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. 
 
 The Company does not generally provide additional U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on outside basis differences of consolidated subsidiaries included in shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls International plc, except in limited circumstances including anticipated taxation on planned divestitures. The reduction of the outside basis differences via the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries and/or distributions could create taxable income. The Company s intent is to reduce the outside basis differences only when it would be tax efficient. Refer to "Capitalization" within the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for discussion of U.S. and non-U.S. cash projections. 
 
 Refer to Note 18, "Income Taxes," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the Company's income tax disclosures.

RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
 The Company selectively uses derivative instruments to reduce market risk associated with changes in foreign currency, commodities, and interest rates. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures, which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes. At the inception of the hedge, the Company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge instrument and designates the hedge instrument as a hedge of either a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to an unrecognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge) or a net investment in a non-U.S. operation (a net investment hedge). 
 
 The Company performs hedge effectiveness testing on an ongoing basis depending on the type of hedging instrument used. All derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging," are revalued in the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 For all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, retrospective effectiveness is tested on a monthly basis using a cumulative dollar offset test. The fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued, and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated. The hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80 and 125 . For commodity derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges, effectiveness is tested using a qualitative assessment of the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item. Ineffectiveness is minimal as the Company aligns most of the critical terms of its derivatives with the supply contracts. 
 
 For net investment hedges, the Company assesses its net investment positions in the non-U.S. operations and compares it with the outstanding net investment hedges on a quarterly basis. The hedge is deemed effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instruments designated as the net investment hedge in a non-U.S. operation does not exceed the Company s net investment positions in the respective non-U.S. operation. 
 
 Derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 require no assessment of effectiveness. 
 
 A discussion of the Company s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements, and further disclosure relating to derivatives and hedging activities is included in Note 11, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and Note 12, "Fair Value Measurements," of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Foreign Exchange 
 
 The Company has manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies. In order to maintain strict control and achieve the benefits of the Company s global diversification, foreign exchange exposures for each currency are netted internally so that only its net foreign exchange exposures are, as appropriate, hedged with financial instruments. 
 
 The Company hedges 70 to 90 of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures. The Company primarily enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables. Gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged. The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company also selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure, primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815. 
 
 The Company has entered into foreign currency denominated debt obligations to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries. The currency effects of debt obligations are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") account within shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders where they offset gains and losses recorded on the Company s net investm ents globally. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company estimates that an unfavorable 10 change in the exchange rates would have decreased net unrealized gains by approximately 144 million and 63 million, respectively. 
 
 48 

Interest Rates 
 
 Substantially all of the Company's outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, and, therefore, any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. A 100 basis point increase/decrease in the average interest rate on the Company's variable rate debt would have an immaterial impact on interest expense. 
 
 Commodities 
 
 The Company uses commodity hedge contracts in the financial derivatives market in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts. Commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines. As a cash flow hedge, gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on purchases of the underlying commodities that will be used in the business. The maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities. 

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY AND OTHER MATTERS 
 
 The Company s global operations are governed by environmental laws and worker safety laws. Under various circumstances, these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines, as well as injunctive and remedial relief, for noncompliance and require remediation at sites where Company-related substances have been released into the environment. 
 
 The Company has expended substantial resources globally, both financial and managerial, to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance. However, the Company has been, and in the future may become, the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or the remediation of Company-related substances released into the environment. Such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance, abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties. Historically, neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the Company have been material. 
 
 Refer to Note 21, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson Controls International plc 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Johnson Controls International plc and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 52 

Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Revenue Recognition from Certain Contracts with Customers 
 
 As described in Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized net sales of 22,952 million from continuing operations and 4,466 million from discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2024, of which a majority relates to certain over time and point in time contracts with customers. Revenue from certain long-term contracts to design, manufacture and install building products and systems as well as unscheduled repair or replacement services is recognized on an over time basis, with progress towards completion measured using a cost-to-cost input method based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. The cost-to-cost input method is used as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the Company incurs costs. Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and estimated losses are recorded when identified. The Company enters into extended warranties and long-term service and maintenance agreements with certain customers. For these arrangements, revenue is recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the respective contract term. Revenue associated with the sale of equipment and related installations are generally recognized over time on a cost-to-cost input method, while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are rendered. In other cases, the Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when control over the goods or services transfers to the customer. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition from certain contracts with customers is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the revenue recognized on certain of the Company's over time and point in time contracts with customers. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process for the Company s over time and point in time contracts with customers. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized for a sample of over time and point in time contracts with customers. Evaluating the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized for certain over time contracts with customers involved (i) obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts or service tickets, change orders, and evidence of progress towards completion or services delivered; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the over time revenue recognition methods; (iii) testing, on a sample basis for certain over time contracts, the costs incurred to date; and (iv) performing a comparison of estimated gross margin in the prior year to gross margin at completion of the arrangement in the current year for certain over time contracts with customers. Evaluating the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized for certain point in time contracts with customers involved (i) obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts or purchase orders, evidence of goods delivered, and consideration received in exchange for those goods and (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the point in time revenue recognition method.

 As discussed in more detail in Note 3, "Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations", the Company has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Residential and Light Commercial R LC") HVAC business, including the North America Ducted business and the global Residential joint venture with Hitachi Global Life Solutions, Inc. Hitachi ), of which Johnson Controls owns and Hitachi owns . The R LC HVAC business, which was previously reported in the Global Products segment, meets the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and, as a result, its historical financial results are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation, and assets and liabilities were reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, all activities and amounts reported in the following footnotes relate to the continuing operations of the Company and exclude activities and amounts related to the R LC HVAC business.

separate the timing of the first deliverable until the last piece of equipment is delivered. There may also be extended warranty arrangements with durations of one to commencing upon the end of the standard warranty period. In addition, the Company sells security monitoring systems that may have multiple performance obligations, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. Revenue associated with the sale of equipment and related installations are generally recognized over time on a cost-to-cost input method, while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are rendered. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price method. In order to estimate relative standalone selling price, market data and transfer price studies are utilized. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach or expected cost plus margin approach. If the Company retains ownership of the subscriber system asset, fees for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized over the contract term on a straight-line basis. Non-refundable fees received in connection with the initiation of a monitoring contract, along with associated direct and incremental selling costs, are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the contract. 
 
 In all other cases, the Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when control over the goods or services transfers to the customer. 
 
 The Company assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price, including discounts, rebates, refunds, credits or other similar sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved. These estimates are based on the amount of consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to. 
 
 Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs are included in cost of sales when control transfers to the customer. The Company presents amounts collected from customers for sales and other taxes net of the related amounts remitted.

The Company records the amount charged back to the dealer as a reduction of the previously recorded intangible asset. Intangible assets arising from the ADT dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the same month and year of contract acquisition on a straight-line basis over the period of the customer relationship. The estimated useful life of dealer intangibles ranges from to years.

 from the grant date. The Company's Compensation and Talent Development Committee may approve different vesting terms on specific grants. The fair value of each share-settled restricted award is based on the closing market value of the Company s ordinary shares on the date of grant. The fair value of each cash-settled restricted award is recalculated at the end of each reporting period based on the closing market value of the Company's ordinary shares at the end of the reporting period, and the liability and expense are adjusted based on the new fair value. 
 
 Performance Share Awards 
 
 Performance-based share unit ("PSU") awards are generally contingent on the achievement of predetermined performance goals over a performance period of one to and on the award holder's continuous employment until the vesting date. The majority of PSUs are also indexed to the achievement of specified levels of total shareholder return versus a peer group over the performance period. 
 
 Upon completion of the performance period, earned PSUs are typically settled with shares of the Company's ordinary shares for employees in the U.S. and in cash for employees not in the U.S. 
 
 The fair value of the portion of the PSU which is linked to the achievement of performance goals is based on the closing market value of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense for these PSUs is recognized over the performance period based on the probability of achieving the performance targets. 
 
 The fair value of the portion of the PSU that is indexed to total shareholder return is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation that uses the following assumptions: 
 
 The risk-free interest rate for periods during the contractual life of the PSU is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

after the grant date and expire from the grant date. 
 
 The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the following assumptions: 
 
 The expected life of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. 
 
 The risk-free interest rate for periods during the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
 
 For grants in fiscal 2024 and 2023, expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock corresponding to the expected life as of the grant date. For grants in fiscal 2022, expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock since October 2016 and certain peer companies' stock prior to October 2016 over the most recent period corresponding to the expected life as of the grant date. 
 
 The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of the Company s ordinary shares as of the grant date.

The Company remains obligated to make payments under the terms of the original commercial arrangement regardless of whether the supplier receivable is sold, and does not pledge any assets as security or provide other forms of guarantees for the committed payment to the third-party financial institutions. 
 
 Amounts outstanding related to SCF programs are included in accounts payable in the consolidated statements of financial position. Accounts payable included in the SCF programs were approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses," which is intended to enhance transparency into the nature and function of expenses. The amendments require that on an annual and interim basis, entities disclose disaggregated operating expense information about specific categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and depletion. The Company expects to adopt the new annual disclosures as required for fiscal 2028 and the interim disclosures as required beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2029. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures," which is intended to enhance the transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments require that on an annual basis, entities disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amendments require that entities disclose additional information about income taxes paid as well as additional disclosures of pretax income and income tax expense, and remove the requirement to disclose certain

 divestitures, including the divestiture of its Air Distribution Technologies ("ADTi") business which was included within the Global Products segment. The combined selling price, net of cash divested, was million, of which million was received as of September 30, 2024. In connection with the closing of the ADTi transaction, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of million within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. An impairment of million was recorded within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income while the business was classified as held for sale. Net cash proceeds from the divestitures were used for general corporate purposes. The businesses did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations as the divestitures did not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. 
 
 Fiscal 2023 
 
 In July 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of FM:Systems, a leading digital workplace management and Internet of Things ("IoT") solutions provider for facilities and real estate professionals, for million, net of cash acquired, which was comprised of an upfront cash payment of million, and the estimated fair value at the acquisition date of contingent earn-out liabilities which are primarily based upon the achievement of certain defined operating results in the following the acquisition. In connection with the acquisition and subsequent measurement period adjustments, the Company recorded goodwill of million in the Building Solutions North America segment. Goodwill is attributable primarily to expected synergies, expanded market opportunities and other benefits that the Company believes will result from integrating the products and capabilities of FM:Systems into its operations. The goodwill created in the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. 
 
 During fiscal 2023, the Company acquired several other businesses for a combined purchase price, net of cash acquired, of million, of which million was paid as of September 30, 2023. Intangible assets associated with these acquisitions totaled million and primarily relate to customer relationships and technology. The Company recorded goodwill associated with these acquisitions of million in the Global Products segment, million in the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment and million in the Building Solutions EMEA/LA segment.

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, subject to required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The R LC HVAC business, which was previously reported in the Global Products segment, meets the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations as it represents a strategic shift in the Company's operations and results in the exit of substantially all of its residential and light commercial HVAC businesses. As a result, results of the business are presented in discontinued operations for all periods presented.

 Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are required to be recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value less costs to sell of the held for sale businesses exceeded their carrying value, and therefore, no adjustment was necessary. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges for the Global Retail business of million and the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment of million. The impairment charges were primarily due to reductions in the estimated fair values of the businesses to be disposed as a result of negotiations with potential buyers and were recorded within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company concluded that its Global Retail business no longer met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, as it was no longer probable that it would be sold in the next 12 months. The net assets were reclassified to held and used at the lower of fair value or adjusted carrying value, and due to prior period impairment charges recorded, there was no impact to the consolidated statements of income as a result of this reclassification.

 Contract Balances 
 
 Contract assets represent the Company s right to consideration for performance obligations that have been satisfied but not billed and consist of unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings. Contract liabilities are customer payments received before performance obligations are satisfied. Contract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. 
 
 Contract assets - noncurrent Other noncurrent assets Contract liabilities - current Deferred revenue Contract liabilities - noncurrent Other noncurrent liabilities 
 
 The Company recognized revenue that was included in the beginning of period contract liability balance of approximately billion and billion for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Performance Obligations 
 
 A performance obligation is a distinct good, service, or bundle of goods and services promised in a contract. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When contracts with customers require significant and complex integration, contain goods or services which are highly interdependent or interrelated, or are goods or services which significantly modify or customize other promises in the contracts and, therefore, are not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. For any contracts with multiple performance obligations, the contract s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation. 
 72 

billion, of which approximately is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next . The remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized in revenue beyond primarily relate to large, multi-purpose contracts to construct hospitals, schools and other governmental buildings, which include services to be performed over the building's lifetime, with average initial contract terms of to years. Future contract modifications could affect both the timing and the amount of the remaining performance obligations. The Company excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for service contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts that are cancellable without substantial penalty. 
 
 Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract 
 
 The Company recognizes the incremental costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer as an asset when the costs are recoverable. These costs consist primarily of sales commissions and bid/proposal costs. Costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are capitalized when incurred and amortized to expense over the period of contract performance.

 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred in the asset group comprising the security subscriber business of Argentina, primarily as a result of the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso that occurred during the quarter and the resulting impact on operating results and cash flows. The Company conducted the two-step impairment test required in accordance with ASC 360, "Property, Plant Equipment" and determined that the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its fair value. A non-cash impairment charge to the subscriber system assets of million was recorded and is included in restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income. The Company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the asset group. The primary assumptions and inputs used in the model included management's internal projections of future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate. The fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement" due to the unobservable inputs used.

 Management completed its fiscal 2024 annual impairment test as of July 31, which included a qualitative assessment of all but of its reporting units. The Company did not identify any qualitative factors that suggest that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying amount, including goodwill, and as such, a quantitative impairment test was not necessary. The Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test of reporting unit with million of goodwill, and its fair value was in excess of its carrying value. However, for this reporting unit, a basis point increase in the discount rate, or a basis point decrease in the revenue growth rates, would cause the fair value to be less than the carrying value. While impairment was recorded, it is possible that future changes in circumstances could result in a non-cash impairment charge. 
 
 In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company determined a triggering event had occurred for of its reporting units in the Business Solutions EMEA/LA segment due to year-to-date results and projections for the remainder of fiscal 2024 being lower than the forecast used in the previous annual goodwill impairment test, and a quantitative test of goodwill for possible impairment was necessary. As a result of the goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of million within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income, which was determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its fair value. The Company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The primary assumptions used in the model were management's internal projections of future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate, which are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement." 
 
 In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, management completed an updated comprehensive review of the Silent-Aire reporting unit, which is included in the Global Products segment. Because actual results were lower than planned and the nearer term forecast was revised to reflect lower margins and earnings, the Company determined a triggering event had occurred and a quantitative test of goodwill for possible impairment was necessary. As a result of the goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of million within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2023, which was determined by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its fair value. During its fiscal 2022 annual impairment test, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of million of Silent Aire goodwill within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income. The Company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the Silent-Aire reporting unit in both fiscal 2023 and 2022. The primary assumptions and inputs used in the model included management's internal projections of future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate. The fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement" due to the unobservable inputs used. The Silent-Aire reporting unit had remaining goodwill balance as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 During fiscal 2022, the Company concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of goodwill impairment for its North America Retail reporting unit in conjunction with classifying its Global Retail business as held for sale. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of million within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2022. The North America Retail reporting unit had remaining goodwill balance as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company used the market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the relative estimated sales proceeds for the planned disposal of the Global Retail business attributable to the North America Retail reporting unit. The inputs utilized in the analysis are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement."

 The Company selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to commodity price risk, primarily using commodity hedge contracts, to minimize overall price risk associated with its purchases of copper and aluminum in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts. Commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines. The maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities. 
 
 As cash flow hedges under ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging," the hedge gains or losses due to changes in fair value are initially recorded as a component of AOCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings. These contracts were highly effective in hedging the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Valuation Methods 
 
 Commodity derivatives : The commodity derivatives are valued under a market approach using publicized prices, where available, or dealer quotes. 
 
 Contingent earn-out liabilities : The contingent earn-out liabilities are generally established using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the forecasted operating results and the earn-out formulas specified in the purchase agreements. 
 
 Cross-currency interest rate swaps: The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps represents the difference between the swap's reference rate and exchange rate and the interest and exchange rates for a similar instrument as of the reporting period. Cross-currency interest rate swaps are valued under a market approach using publicized prices. 
 
 Deferred compensation plan assets : Assets held in the deferred compensation plans will be used to pay benefits under certain of the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The investments primarily consist of mutual funds which are publicly traded on stock exchanges and are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices. Unrealized gains (losses) on the deferred compensation plan assets are recognized in the consolidated statements of income where they offset unrealized gains and losses on the related deferred compensation plan liability.

 Defined Contribution Plans 
 
 The Company sponsors various defined contribution savings plans that allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income in accordance with plan specified guidelines. Under specified conditions, the Company will contribute to certain savings plans based on predetermined percentages of compensation earned by the employee and/or will match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. Defined contribution plan contributions charged to expense amounted to million, million and million during the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 Multiemployer Benefit Plans 
 
 The Company contributes to multiemployer benefit plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements related to certain of its hourly employees in the U.S. These plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans. 
 
 The risks of participating in these multiemployer benefit plans are different from single-employer benefit plans in the following aspects: 
 
 Assets contributed to the multiemployer benefit plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. 
 
 If a participating employer stops contributing to the multiemployer benefit plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. 
 
 If the Company stops participating in some of its multiemployer benefit plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on its allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. 
 
 The Company participates in approximately multiemployer benefit plans, none of which are individually significant to the Company. The number of employees covered by the Company s multiemployer benefit plans has remained consistent over the past three years, and there have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 contributions. The Company recognizes expense for the contractually-required contribution for each period. The Company contributed million, million and million to multiemployer benefit plans during the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 Based on the most recent information available, the Company believes that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in certain of these multiemployer benefit plans may exceed the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. Currently, the Company is not aware of any significant multiemployer benefit plans for which it is probable or reasonably possible that the Company will be obligated to make up any shortfall in funds. Moreover, if the Company were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds, the Company could trigger a withdrawal liability. Currently, the Company is not aware of any multiemployer benefit plans for which it is probable or reasonably possible that the Company will have a significant withdrawal liability. Any accrual for a shortfall or withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and it can be reasonably estimated.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. Certain assets are held within commingled funds which are valued at the unitized NAV or percentage of the net asset value as determined by the manager of the fund. These values are based on the fair value of the underlying net assets owned by the fund. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents: The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is valued at cost. 
 
 Equity Securities: The fair value of equity securities is determined by direct quoted market prices. The underlying holdings are direct quoted market prices on regulated financial exchanges. 
 
 Fixed Income Securities: The fair value of fixed income securities is determined by direct or indirect quoted market prices. If indirect quoted market prices are utilized, the value of assets held in separate accounts is not published, but the investment managers report daily the underlying holdings. The underlying holdings are direct quoted market prices on regulated financial exchanges. 
 
 Hedge Funds: The fair value of hedge funds is accounted for by the custodian. The custodian obtains valuations from underlying managers based on market quotes for the most liquid assets and alternative methods for assets that do not have sufficient trading activity to derive prices. The Company and custodian review the methods used by the underlying managers to value the assets. The Company believes this is an appropriate methodology to obtain the fair value of these assets. 
 
 Real Estate: The fair value of real estate is determined by quoted market prices of the underlying Real Estate Investment Trusts 
 ("REITs"), which are securities traded on an open exchange. 
 
 The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

As a result, the Company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction, the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments.

 Valuation Allowances 
 
 The Company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Company s valuation allowances may be necessary. 
 
 In fiscal 2024, due to changes in forecasted taxable income, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets of Mexico and Germany would be realized. The valuation allowance adjustment resulted in a tax benefit of million . 
 
 In fiscal 2023, due to changes in forecasted taxable income, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets of Canada, Mexico, and Spain would be realized. The valuation allowance adjustment resulted in a tax benefit of million.

 Impacts of Tax Legislation and Change in Statutory Tax Rates 
 
 On December 18, 2023, the president of Ireland signed into law the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2023, which included legislation regarding the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. The Pillar Two legislation is effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning October 1, 2024. 
 
 On September 11, 2023, the Schaffhausen parliament approved a partial revision of the cantonal act on direct taxation: Immediate Minimum Taxation Measure IMTM ). On November 19, 2023, IMTM was approved in a public referendum in the canton of Schaffhausen, was published in the cantonal official gazette on December 8, 2023, and was effective starting January 1, 2024. The IMTM increased Switzerland's combined statutory income tax rate to approximately . As a result, in fiscal 2024, the Company recorded a noncash discrete net tax benefit of million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Switzerland and the canton of Schaffhausen. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act IRA which, among other things, created a new book minimum tax of at least 15 of consolidated GAAP pre-tax income for corporations with average book income in excess of 1 billion. The book minimum tax was first applicable in fiscal 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rate.

 At September 30, 2024, the Company has not provided U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on approximately billion of outside basis differences of consolidated subsidiaries of Johnson Controls International plc. The Company is indefinitely reinvested in these basis differences. The reduction of the outside basis differences via the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries and/or distributions could create taxable income. The Company's intent is to reduce the outside basis differences only when it would be tax efficient. Given the numerous ways in which the basis differences may be reduced, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized withholding taxes and deferred tax liability on the outside basis differences.

 At September 30, 2024, the Company had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion, of which billion will expire at various dates between 2025 and 2044, and the remainder has an indefinite carryforward period. The Company had available U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards at September 30, 2024 of million which will expire in 2029. The valuation allowance, generally, is for loss and credit carryforwards for which realization is uncertain because it is unlikely that the losses and/or credits will be realized given the lack of sustained profitability and/or limited carryforward periods in certain countries.

 Other noncurrent liabilities Total reserves for environmental liabilities 
 
 The Company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters described below are probable and reasonably estimable based on experience and ongoing developments in those matters, including continued study and analysis of ongoing remediation obligations. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over an estimated period of up to years. The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss, if any, in excess of the established accruals for environmental liabilities at this time. 
 
 A substantial portion of the Company's environmental reserves relates to ongoing long-term remediation efforts to address contamination relating to Aqueous Film Forming Foam ("AFFF") containing perfluorooctane sulfonate ("PFOS"), perfluorooctanoic acid ("PFOA"), and/or other per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances ("PFAS") at or near the Tyco Fire Products L.P. Tyco Fire Products Fire Technology Center ("FTC") located in Marinette, Wisconsin and surrounding areas in the City of Marinette and Town of Peshtigo, Wisconsin, as well as the continued remediation of PFAS, arsenic and other contaminants at the Tyco Fire Products Stanton Street manufacturing facility also located in Marinette, Wisconsin (the Stanton Street Facility ). 
 
 PFOA, PFOS, and other PFAS compounds are being studied by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and other environmental and health agencies and researchers. In March 2021, EPA published its final determination to regulate PFOS and PFOA in drinking water. On April 10, 2024, EPA announced the final National Primary Drinking Water Regulation NPDWR for six PFAS compounds including PFOA and PFOS. The NPDWR established legally enforceable levels, called Maximum Contaminant Levels, of 4.0 parts per trillion ("ppt") for each of PFOA and PFOS, 10 ppt for each of PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX Chemicals), and a Hazard Index of one for mixtures containing two or more of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBA. In February 2024, EPA released two proposed rules relating to PFAS under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA ): one rule proposes to list nine PFAS (including PFOA and PFOS) as hazardous constituents, and a second rule proposes to clarify that hazardous waste regulated under the rule includes not only substances listed or identified as hazardous waste in the regulations, but also any substances that meet the statutory definition of hazardous waste. 
 
 In August 2022, EPA published a proposed rule that would designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"). In April 2023, EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("ANPR") seeking input on whether it should expand the proposed rule to designate as "hazardous substances" under CERCLA: (1) seven additional PFAS; (2) the precursors to PFOA, PFOS, and the seven additional PFAS; or (3) entire categories of PFAS. On April 17, 2024, the EPA Administrator signed the final rule designating PFOA and PFOS, along with their salts and structural isomers, as hazardous substances. 
 
 It is not possible to estimate the Company s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved, the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties, the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors, the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted, changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in soil, groundwater and drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages, the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment, the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites, and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur. It is possible that technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the results of additional environmental studies or other factors could change the Company's expectations with respect to future charges and cash outlays, and such changes could be material to the Company's future results of operations, financial condition or cash

million and million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 FTC-Related Matters 
 
 FTC Remediation 
 
 The use of fire-fighting foams at the FTC was primarily for training and testing purposes to ensure that such products sold by the Company s affiliates, Chemguard, Inc. ("Chemguard") and Tyco Fire Products, were effective at suppressing high intensity fires that may occur at military installations, airports or elsewhere. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, Tyco Fire Products completed its previously announced plan to discontinue the production and sale of fluorinated firefighting foams, including AFFF products, and has transitioned to non-fluorinated foam alternatives. 
 
 Tyco Fire Products has been engaged in remediation activities at the Stanton Street Facility since 1990. Its corporate predecessor, Ansul Incorporated Ansul ), manufactured arsenic-based agricultural herbicides at the Stanton Street Facility, which resulted in significant arsenic contamination of soil and groundwater on the site and in parts of the adjoining Menominee River. In 2009, Ansul entered into an Administrative Consent Order (the "Consent Order") with the EPA to address the presence of arsenic at the site. Under this agreement, Tyco Fire Products principal obligations are to contain the arsenic contamination on the site, pump and treat on-site groundwater, dredge, treat and properly dispose of contaminated sediments in the adjoining river areas, and monitor contamination levels on an ongoing basis. Activities completed under the Consent Order since 2009 include the installation of a subsurface barrier wall around the facility to contain contaminated groundwater, the installation and ongoing operation and monitoring of a groundwater extraction and treatment system and the dredging and offsite disposal of treated river sediment. In addition to ongoing remediation activities, the Company is also working with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("WDNR") to investigate and remediate the presence of PFAS at or near the Stanton Street Facility as part of the evaluation and remediation of PFAS in the Marinette region. 
 
 Tyco Fire Products is operating and monitoring at the FTC a Groundwater Extraction and Treatment System ("GETS"), a permanent groundwater remediation system that extracts groundwater containing PFAS, treats it using advanced filtration systems, and returns the treated water to the environment. Tyco Fire Products has also completed the removal and disposal of PFAS-affected soil from the FTC. The Company's reserves for continued remediation of the FTC, the Stanton Street Facility and surrounding areas in Marinette and Peshtigo are based on estimates of costs associated with the long-term remediation actions, including the continued operation of the GETS, the implementation of long-term drinking water solutions for the area impacted by groundwater migrating from the FTC, continued monitoring and testing of groundwater monitoring wells, the operation and wind-down of other legacy remediation and treatment systems and the completion of ongoing investigation obligations. 
 
 FTC-Related Litigation 
 
 On June 21, 2019, the WDNR announced that it had received from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services WDHS a recommendation for groundwater quality standards as to, among other compounds, PFOA and PFOS. The WDHS recommended a groundwater enforcement standard for PFOA and PFOS of 20 parts per trillion. Although Wisconsin approved final regulatory standards for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water and surface water in February 2022, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board did not approve WDNR's proposed standards for PFOA and PFOS in groundwater. In August 2024, WDNR issued a new proposed rule to adopt the EPA Maximum Contaminant Levels for PFAS in drinking water. The WDNR initiated a rulemaking proceeding that would establish groundwater quality standards for PFOA, PFOS, perfluorobutane sulfonic acid and its potassium salt PFBS and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid and its ammonium salt HFPO-DA ). Pursuant to state law, the WDNR has stopped work on the proposed rule and notified the state legislature that, following economic analysis, the proposed costs would exceed statutory thresholds. As a result, the state legislature is required to authorize the WDNR to allow the rulemaking to continue. 
 
 In July 2019, the Company received a letter from the WDNR directing the expansion of the evaluation of PFAS in the Marinette region to include (1) biosolids sludge produced by the City of Marinette Waste Water Treatment Plant and spread on certain fields in the area and (2) the Menominee and Peshtigo Rivers. On October 16, 2019, the WDNR issued a Notice of Noncompliance to Tyco Fire Products and Johnson Controls, Inc. regarding the WDNR s July 2019 letter. The WDNR issued a further letter regarding the issue on November 4, 2019. In February 2020, the WDNR sent a letter to Tyco Fire Products and 
 106 

subsidiaries to complete a site investigation and cleanup of PFAS contamination in accordance with the WDNR's requests. The parties are engaged in summary judgment and pretrial motions and the court has set a trial date of March 3, 2025. 
 
 In October 2022, the Town of Peshtigo filed a tort action in Wisconsin state court against Tyco Fire Products, Johnson Controls Inc., Chemguard, Inc., and ChemDesign, Inc. relating to environmental matters at the FTC Town of Peshtigo v. Tyco Fire Products L.P. et al. , Case No. 2022CV000234 (filed October 18, 2022 in Circuit Court in Marinette County, Wisconsin)). The Town alleges that use of AFFF products at the FTC caused contamination of water supplies in Peshtigo. The Town seeks monetary penalties and an injunction ordering abatement of PFAS contamination in Peshtigo. The case has been removed to federal court and transferred to a multi-district litigation ("MDL") before the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. 
 
 In November 2022, individuals filed actions in Dane County, Wisconsin alleging personal injury and/or property damage against Tyco Fire Products, Johnson Controls Inc., Chemguard, and other unaffiliated defendants related to environmental matters at the FTC. Plaintiffs allege that use of AFFF products at the FTC and activities by third parties unrelated to the Company contaminated nearby drinking water sources, surface waters, and other natural resources and properties, including their personal properties. The individuals seek monetary damages for their personal injury and/or property damage. These lawsuits have been transferred to the MDL. Subsequently, several additional plaintiffs have direct-filed in the MDL complaints with similar allegations. 
 
 The Company is vigorously defending each of these cases and believes that it has meritorious defenses, but it is presently unable to predict the duration, scope, or outcome of these actions. 
 
 Aqueous Film-Forming Foam ("AFFF") Matters 
 
 AFFF Litigation 
 
 of the Company's subsidiaries, Chemguard and Tyco Fire Products, have been named, along with other defendant manufacturers, suppliers and distributors, and, in some cases, certain subsidiaries of the Company affiliated with Chemguard and Tyco Fire Products, in a number of class action and other lawsuits relating to the use of fire-fighting foam products by the U.S. Department of Defense (the "DOD") and others for fire suppression purposes and related training exercises. Plaintiffs generally allege that the firefighting foam products contain or break down into the chemicals PFOS and PFOA and/or other PFAS compounds and that the use of these products by others at various airbases, airports and other sites resulted in the release of these chemicals into the environment and ultimately into communities drinking water supplies neighboring those airports, airbases and other sites. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages, including damages for alleged personal injuries, medical monitoring, diminution in property values, investigation and remediation costs, and natural resources damages, and also seek punitive damages and injunctive relief to address remediation of the alleged contamination. 
 
 In September 2018, Tyco Fire Products and Chemguard filed a Petition for Multidistrict Litigation with the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation JPML seeking to consolidate all existing and future federal cases into one jurisdiction. On December 7, 2018, the JPML issued an order transferring various AFFF cases to the MDL. Additional cases have been identified for transfer to or are being directly filed in the MDL. 
 
 107 

cases in federal and state courts involving municipal or water provider plaintiffs that were filed in state or federal courts originating from states and territories. The vast majority of these cases have been transferred to or were directly filed in the MDL, and it is anticipated that the remaining cases will be transferred to the MDL. These municipal and water provider plaintiffs generally allege that the use of the defendants fire-fighting foam products at fire training academies, municipal airports, Air National Guard bases, or Navy or Air Force bases released PFOS and PFOA into public water supply wells and/or other public property, allegedly requiring remediation. 
 
 Tyco Fire Products and Chemguard are also periodically notified by other municipal entities that those entities may assert claims regarding PFOS and/or PFOA contamination allegedly resulting from the use of AFFF. 
 
 Water Systems AFFF Settlement Agreement 
 
 On April 12, 2024, Tyco Fire Products agreed to a settlement with a nationwide class of public water systems that detected PFAS in their drinking water systems that they allege to be associated with the use of AFFF. Under the terms of the agreement, Tyco Fire Products agreed to contribute million to resolve these PFAS claims. The settlement releases these claims against Tyco Fire Products, Chemguard, and other related corporate entities. In connection with the settlement, a charge for million was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Tyco Fire Products contributed an initial payment of million in June 2024, with the remaining million due by the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Prior to the date of the final contribution, Tyco Fire Products has agreed to contribute any applicable insurance recoveries in excess of the initial million payment, up to the remaining million due, within a specified period following the receipt of such recovery. During fiscal 2024, the Company recorded expected insurance recoveries of million in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and collected insurance recoveries of million. In accordance with its agreement and recent insurance recovery, Tyco Fire Products made an additional payment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 of approximately million, reducing its final payment to approximately million. The amounts and timing of any additional insurance recoveries are uncertain. 
 
 There are still several procedural and legal steps that must occur before the settlement is final and the remaining payment is made. The settlement is subject to final approval by the MDL court and other contingencies, and that process is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2025. 
 
 The class of public water systems included in this settlement broadly includes any public water system (as defined in the settlement agreement) that has detected PFAS in its drinking water sources as of May 15, 2024. The following systems are excluded from the settlement class: water systems owned and operated by a State or the United States government; systems that have not detected the presence of PFAS as of May 15, 2024; small transient water systems; privately-owned drinking water wells; and the water system in the city of Marinette, Wisconsin (which is included only if it so requests). The settlement does not resolve claims of public water systems that request exclusion from the class opt out pursuant to the process to be established by the MDL court. It also does not resolve potential future claims of public water systems that detect PFAS in their water systems for the first time after May 15, 2024, or certain claims not related to drinking water, such as separate alleged claims relating to real property damage or stormwater or wastewater treatment. Finally, this settlement does not affect the other categories of cases that remain at issue in the MDL, such as personal injury cases, property damage cases, other types of class actions, claims brought by state or territory attorneys general, or other types of damages alleged to be related to the historical use of AFFF manufactured and sold by Tyco Fire Products and Chemguard. While it is reasonably possible that the excluded systems or claims could result in additional future lawsuits, claims, assessments or proceedings, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such matters, and as such, the Company is unable to develop an estimate of a possible loss or range of losses, if any, at this time. 
 
 The settlement does not constitute an admission of liability or wrongdoing by Tyco Fire Products or Chemguard. If the MDL court does not approve the agreement or certain terms are not fulfilled, Tyco Fire Products and Chemguard will continue to defend themselves in the litigation. 
 
 AFFF Putative Class Actions 
 
 Chemguard and Tyco Fire Products are named in pending putative class actions in federal courts originating from states and territories. All of these cases have been direct-filed in or transferred to the MDL. In addition, six proposed class actions were filed in Canada (British Columbia, Manitoba, Quebec and Ontario) in the past year against Tyco Fire Products and other 
 108 

individual or mass actions pending that were filed in state or federal courts originating from states and territories against Chemguard and Tyco Fire Products and other defendants in which the plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages, including damages for alleged personal injuries, medical monitoring, and alleged diminution in property values. The cases involve plaintiffs from various states including approximately plaintiffs in Colorado and more than other plaintiffs. The vast majority of these matters have been tagged for transfer to, transferred to, or directly-filed in the MDL, and it is anticipated that several newly-filed state court actions will be similarly tagged and transferred. There are several matters that are proceeding in state courts, including actions in Arizona, Illinois, Virginia and Wisconsin. 
 
 Tyco and Chemguard are also periodically notified by other individuals that they may assert claims regarding PFOS and/or PFOA contamination allegedly resulting from the use of AFFF. 
 
 AFFF State or U.S. Territory Attorneys General Litigation 
 
 In June 2018, the State of New York filed a lawsuit in New York state court State of New York v. The 3M Company et al No. 904029-18 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Albany County)) against a number of manufacturers, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to alleged PFOS and PFOA contamination purportedly resulting from firefighting foams used at locations across New York, including Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh and Gabreski Air National Guard Base in Southampton, Plattsburgh Air Force Base in Plattsburgh, Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, and unspecified other sites throughout the State. The lawsuit seeks to recover costs and natural resource damages associated with contamination at these sites. This suit has been removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and transferred to the MDL. 
 
 In February 2019, the State of New York filed a second lawsuit in New York state court State of New York v. The 3M Company et al (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Albany County)), against a number of manufacturers, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to alleged PFOS and PFOA contamination purportedly resulting from firefighting foams used at additional locations across New York. This suit has been removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and transferred to the MDL. In July 2019, the State of New York filed a third lawsuit in New York state court State of New York v. The 3M Company et al (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Albany County)), against a number of manufacturers, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to alleged PFOS and PFOA contamination purportedly resulting from firefighting foams used at further additional locations across New York. This suit has been removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and transferred to the MDL. In November 2019, the State of New York filed a fourth lawsuit in New York state court State of New York v. The 3M Company et al (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Albany County)), against a number of manufacturers, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to alleged PFOS and PFOA contamination purportedly resulting from firefighting foams used at further additional locations across New York. This suit has been removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL. 
 
 In April 2021, the State of Alaska filed a lawsuit in the superior court of the State of Alaska against a number of manufacturers and other defendants, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to PFOS and PFOA damage of the State s land and natural resources allegedly resulting from the use of firefighting foams at various locations throughout the State. The State s case has been removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL. The State of Alaska has also named a number of manufacturers and other defendants, including affiliates of the Company, as third-party defendants in cases brought by individuals against the State. These cases have also been transferred to the MDL. 
 
 In early November 2021, the Attorney General of the State of North Carolina filed individual lawsuits in the superior courts of the State of North Carolina against a number of manufacturers and other defendants, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to PFOS and PFOA damage of the State s land, natural resources, and property allegedly resulting from the use of firefighting foams at four separate locations throughout the State. These cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL. In October 2022, the Attorney General filed similar lawsuits in the superior courts of the State of North Carolina regarding alleged PFAS damages at two additional locations. These cases have also been removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL. 
 
 In addition, other states and territories have filed lawsuits against a number of manufacturers and other defendants, including affiliates of the Company, with respect to PFAS damage of each of those State's environmental and natural resources allegedly resulting from the manufacture, storage, sale, distribution, marketing, and use of PFAS-containing AFFF within each respective State. The states and territories are: Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of

Investments Total restricted assets Insurance receivables for asbestos-related liabilities Total asbestos-related assets 
 
 The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets are based on the Company's strategies for resolving its asbestos claims, currently available information, and a number of estimates and assumptions. Key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year, the average cost of resolution of claims, the identity of defendants, the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers, amount of insurance, and the solvency risk with respect to the Company's insurance carriers. Many of these factors are closely linked, such that a change in one variable or assumption may impact one or more of the others, and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the Company's asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets. Furthermore, predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period. Other factors that may affect the Company's liability and cash payments for asbestos-related matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries. As a result, actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the Company's calculations vary significantly from actual results. 
 
 Self-Insured Liabilities 
 
 The Company records liabilities for its workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities. The determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience. The Company maintains captive insurance companies to manage a portion of its insurable liabilities.

ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, and that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company s management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

 Our authorized share capital is 22,000,000 and 40,000, divided into 2,000,000,000 ordinary shares with a par value of 0.01 per share, 200,000,000 preferred shares with a par value of 0.01 per share, and 40,000 ordinary A shares with a par value of 1.00 per share. The authorized share capital includes 40,000 ordinary A shares with a par value of 1.00 per share in order, at the time of its incorporation, to satisfy statutory requirements for the incorporation of all Irish public limited companies. We may issue shares subject to the maximum amount prescribed by our authorized share capital contained in our memorandum and articles of association. 
 As a matter of Irish company law, the directors of a company may issue new ordinary or preferred shares (including the grant of options and issue of warrants) without shareholder approval once authorized to do so by the memorandum and articles of association of the company or by an ordinary resolution adopted by the shareholders at a general meeting. An ordinary resolution requires over 50 of the votes cast by a company s shareholders at a general meeting. The authority conferred can be granted for a maximum period of five years, at which point it will lapse unless renewed by the shareholders of the company by an ordinary resolution. The board of directors is authorized, under an annual authorization by shareholders pursuant to an ordinary resolution, to issue ordinary shares subject to a maximum of approximately 20 of our issued share capital. The current annual authorization will expire at the earlier of the date of our annual general meeting in 2025 or September 13, 2025 unless renewed (a renewal of the authorization will be proposed at our annual general meeting in 2025, which if approved would expire on the date of our annual general meeting in 2026 or 18 months after the date of our 2025 annual general meeting (whichever is earlier)). 
 Notwithstanding this authority, under the Irish Takeover Rules the board of directors would not be permitted to issue any shares, during a period when an offer has been made for us or is believed to be imminent unless the issue is (i) approved by shareholders at a general meeting, (ii) consented to by the Irish Takeover Panel on the basis it would not constitute action frustrating the offer, (iii) consented to by the Irish Takeover Panel and approved by the holders of more than 50 of our voting rights, (iv) consented to by the Irish Takeover Panel in circumstances where a contract for the issue of the shares had been entered into prior to that period, or (v) consented to by the Irish Takeover Panel in circumstances where the issue of the shares was decided by our board of directors prior to that period and either action has been taken to implement the issuance (whether in part or in full) prior to such period or the issuance was otherwise in the ordinary course of business. 
 The board of directors has previously represented that it will not, without prior shareholder approval, approve the issuance or use of any of the preferred shares for any defensive or anti-takeover purpose or for the purpose of implementing any shareholder rights plan. Within these limits, the board of directors may approve the issuance or use of preferred shares for capital raising, financing or acquisition needs or opportunities that has the effect of making a takeover of us or other acquisition transaction more difficult or costly, as could also be the case if the board of directors were to issue additional ordinary shares. 
 The authority to issue preferred shares provides us with the flexibility to consider and respond to future business needs and opportunities as they arise from time to time, including in connection with capital raising, financing, and acquisition transactions or opportunities. 
 The authorized but unissued share capital may be increased or reduced by way of an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. The shares comprising our authorized share capital may be divided into shares of such par value as the 

resolution shall prescribe. The rights and restrictions to which the ordinary shares will be subject are prescribed in our memorandum and articles of association. 
 Irish law does not recognize fractional shares held of record accordingly, our memorandum and articles of association do not provide for the issuance of fractional shares, and our official Irish register will not reflect any fractional shares. 
 Dividends 
 Under Irish law, dividends and distributions may only be made from distributable reserves. Distributable reserves, broadly, means our accumulated realized profits less our accumulated realized losses. In addition, no distribution or dividend may be made unless our net assets are equal to, or in excess of, the aggregate of our called up share capital plus undistributable reserves and the distribution does not reduce our net assets below such aggregate. Undistributable reserves include the share premium account, the par value of shares acquired by us and the amount by which our accumulated unrealized profits, so far as not previously utilized by any capitalization, exceed our accumulated unrealized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital. 
 The determination as to whether or not we have sufficient distributable reserves to fund a dividend must be made by reference to our relevant financial statements. The relevant financial statements will be either the last set of unconsolidated annual audited financial statements or unaudited financial statements prior to the declaration of a dividend prepared in accordance with the Irish Companies Act, which give a true and fair view of our unconsolidated financial position and accord with accepted accounting practice. The relevant financial statements must be filed in the Companies Registration Office (the official public registry for companies in Ireland). 
 The mechanism as to who declares a dividend and when a dividend shall become payable is governed by our articles of association, which authorize the directors to declare such dividends as appear justified from our profits without the approval of the shareholders at a general meeting. The board of directors may also recommend a dividend to be approved and declared by the shareholders at a general meeting. Although the shareholders may direct that the payment be made by distribution of assets, shares or cash, no dividend issued may exceed the amount recommended by the directors. The dividends can be declared and paid in the form of cash or non-cash assets. 
 Our directors may deduct from any dividend payable to any shareholder all sums of money (if any) payable by him or her to us in relation to our shares. Our directors are also entitled to issue shares with preferred rights to participate in dividends we declare. The holders of such preferred shares may, depending on their terms, be entitled to claim arrears of a declared dividend out of subsequently declared dividends in priority to ordinary shareholders. 
 Preemptive Rights and Advance Subscription Rights 
 Certain statutory preemption rights apply automatically in favor of our shareholders where our shares are to be issued for cash (including pursuant to non-compensatory options). Statutory preemption rights do not apply (i) where shares are issued for non-cash consideration (such as in a stock-for-stock acquisition), (ii) to the issue of non-equity shares (that is, shares that have the right to participate only up to a specified amount in any income or capital distribution) or (iii) where shares are issued pursuant to an employee option or similar equity plan. In addition, and without prejudice to any existing authorities granted to the board of directors, the board of directors is authorized, under an annual authorization by shareholders pursuant to a special resolution, to issue ordinary shares without the application of preemption rights of up to approximately 20 of our issued share capital. The current annual authorization will expire at the earlier of the date of our annual general meeting in 2025 or September 13, 2025 unless renewed (a renewal of the authorization will be proposed at our annual general meeting in 2025, which if approved would expire on the date of our annual general meeting in 2026 or 18 months after the date of our 2025 annual general meeting (whichever is earlier)). 
 A special resolution requires not less than 75 of the votes cast by our shareholders at a general meeting. If the opt-out is not renewed, shares issued for cash must be offered to our pre-existing shareholders pro rata to their 

existing shareholding in accordance with the statutory preemption rights described above before the shares can be issued to any new shareholders. 
 Issuance of Warrants and Options 
 Our articles of association provide that, subject to any shareholder approval requirement under any laws, regulations or the rules of any stock exchange to which we are subject, the board is authorized, from time to time, in its discretion, to grant such persons, for such periods and upon such terms as the board deems advisable, options to purchase such number of shares of any class or classes or of any series of any class as the board may deem advisable, and to cause warrants or other appropriate instruments evidencing such options to be issued. The issuance of warrants or options is subject to the same requirements for shareholder authority and statutory preemption rights as applies to the issue of ordinary shares described under the headings Capital Structure Authorized and Issued Share Capital and Preemptive Rights and Advance Subscription Rights in this summary and the number of shares capable of being issued under options and warrants are aggregated with the number of shares issued under those authorizations for determining the utilization of those authorizations. The board may issue shares upon exercise of warrants or options without shareholder approval or authorization provided that the original warrants or options were issued when valid authorization was in place. 
 Share Repurchases and Redemptions 
 Overview 
 Article 3 of our articles of association provides that any ordinary share which we have acquired or agreed to acquire shall be deemed to be a redeemable share. Accordingly, for Irish company law purposes, the repurchase of ordinary shares by us will technically be effected as a redemption of those shares as described below. If our articles of association did not contain Article 3(d), repurchases of our ordinary shares would be subject to many of the same rules that apply to purchases of our ordinary shares by subsidiaries described below, including the shareholder approval requirements described below and the requirement that any on-market purchases be effected on a recognized stock exchange. Except where otherwise noted, when we refer to repurchasing or buying back our ordinary shares, we are referring to the redemption of ordinary shares by us pursuant to Article 3(d) of the articles of association or the purchase of our ordinary shares by a subsidiary of ours, in each case in accordance with our articles of association and Irish company law as described below. 
 Repurchases and Redemptions by Us 
 Under Irish law, a company can issue redeemable shares and redeem them out of distributable reserves or the proceeds of a new issue of shares for that purpose. The issue of redeemable shares may only be made by us where the nominal value of the issued share capital that is not redeemable is not less than 10 of the aggregate of the par value and share premium in respect of the allotment of our shares together with the par value of any shares acquired by us. All redeemable shares must also be fully paid and the terms of redemption of the shares must provide for payment on redemption. Redeemable shares may, upon redemption, be cancelled or held in treasury. Shareholder approval will not be required to redeem our ordinary shares. Our board of directors will also be entitled to issue preferred shares which may be redeemed at either our option or the that of the shareholder, depending on the terms of such preferred shares. 
 Repurchased and redeemed shares may be cancelled or held as treasury shares. The nominal value of treasury shares held by us at any time must not exceed 10 of our company capital (consisting of the aggregate of the par value and share premium in respect of the allotment of our shares together with the par value of any shares acquired by us). While we hold shares as treasury shares, we cannot exercise any voting rights in respect of those shares. We may cancel or reissue treasury shares subject to certain conditions. 
 Purchases by Our Subsidiaries 
 Under Irish law, it may be permissible for an Irish or non-Irish subsidiary to purchase our shares either on-market or off-market. A general authority of our shareholders is required to allow a subsidiary of ours to make on-market purchases of our ordinary shares however, as long as this general authority has been granted, no specific 

shareholder authority for a particular on-market purchase by a subsidiary of our ordinary shares is required. Such an authority has been adopted by our shareholders. We have sought such general authority, which must expire no later than 18 months after the date on which it was granted, at previous annual general meetings and expect to seek to renew such authority at subsequent annual general meetings. In order for a subsidiary of ours to make an on-market purchase of our shares, such shares must be purchased on a recognized stock exchange. The New York Stock Exchange, on which our shares are listed, is a recognized stock exchange for this purpose under Irish company law. For an off-market purchase by a subsidiary of ours, the proposed purchase contract must be authorized by special resolution of our shareholders before the contract is entered into. The person whose shares are to be bought back cannot vote in favor of the special resolution and, from the date of the notice of the meeting at which the resolution approving the contract is to be proposed, the purchase contract must be on display or must be available for inspection by shareholders at our registered office. 
 The number of shares held by our subsidiaries at any time will count as treasury shares and will be included in any calculation of the permitted treasury share threshold of 10 of the aggregate of the par value and share premium in respect of the allotment of our shares together with the par value of any shares acquired by us. While a subsidiary holds our shares, it cannot exercise any voting rights in respect of those shares. The acquisition of our shares by a subsidiary must be funded out of distributable reserves of the subsidiary. 
 Lien on Shares, Calls on Shares and Forfeiture of Shares 
 Our articles of association provide that we will have a first and paramount lien on every share for all moneys payable, whether presently due or not, in respect of such share. Subject to the terms of their allotment, directors may call for any unpaid amounts in respect of any shares to be paid, and if payment is not made, the shares may be forfeited. These provisions are standard inclusions in the articles of association of an Irish company limited by shares, such as us. 
 Bonus Shares 
 Under our articles of association, the board of directors may resolve to capitalize any amount credited to any reserve or fund available for distribution or the share premium account or other undistributable reserve of ours for issuance and distribution to shareholders as fully paid up bonus shares on the same basis of entitlement as would apply in respect of a dividend distribution. 
 Consolidation and Division Subdivision 
 Under our articles of association, we may by ordinary resolution consolidate and divide all or any of our share capital into shares of larger par value than its existing shares or subdivide our shares into smaller amounts than is fixed by our articles of association. 
 Reduction of Share Capital 
 We may, by ordinary resolution, reduce our authorized but unissued share capital in any way and reduce the nominal value of any of its shares. We also may, by special resolution and subject to confirmation by the Irish High Court (or as otherwise permitted under the Irish Companies Act), reduce or cancel our issued share capital in any way. 
 General Meetings of Shareholders 
 We are generally required to hold an annual general meeting at intervals of no more than fifteen months, provided that an annual general meeting is held in each calendar year, no more than nine months after our fiscal year-end. 
 Our articles of association provide that shareholder meetings may be held outside of Ireland (subject to compliance with the Irish Companies Act). Where a company holds its annual general meeting or extraordinary general meeting outside of Ireland, the Irish Companies Act requires that the company, at its own expense, make all 

necessary arrangements to ensure that members can by technological means participate in the meeting without leaving Ireland (unless all of the members entitled to attend and vote at the meeting consent in writing to the meeting being held outside of Ireland). 
 Extraordinary general meetings may be convened by (i) the board of directors, (ii) on requisition of the shareholders holding not less than 10 of the paid up share capital of our shares carrying voting rights or (iii) on requisition of our auditors. Extraordinary general meetings are generally held for the purposes of approving shareholder resolutions as may be required from time to time. 
 Notice of a general meeting must be given to all of our shareholders and to our auditors. Our articles of association provide that the maximum notice period is 60 days. The minimum notice periods are 21 days notice in writing for an annual general meeting or an extraordinary general meeting to approve a special resolution and 14 days notice in writing for any other extraordinary general meeting. In each case the notice period excludes the date of mailing, the date of the meeting and is in addition to two days for deemed delivery where this is by electronic means. General meetings may be called by shorter notice, but only with the consent of our auditors and all of the shareholders entitled to attend and vote thereat. Because of the 21-day and 14-day requirements described in this paragraph, our articles of association include provisions reflecting these requirements of Irish law. 
 In the case of an extraordinary general meeting convened by our shareholders, the proposed purpose of the meeting must be set out in the requisition notice. The requisition notice can contain any resolution. Upon receipt of this requisition notice, the board of directors has 21 days to convene a meeting of our shareholders to vote on the matters set out in the requisition notice. This meeting must be held within two months of the receipt of the requisition notice. If the board of directors does not convene the meeting within such 21-day period, the requisitioning shareholders, or any of them representing more than one half of the total voting rights of all of them, may themselves convene a meeting, which meeting must be held within three months of the receipt of the requisition notice. 
 The only matters which must, as a matter of Irish company law, be transacted at an annual general meeting are the presentation of the annual accounts, balance sheet and reports of the directors and auditors, the appointment of auditors and the fixing of the auditor s remuneration (or delegation of same). If no resolution is made in respect of the reappointment of an auditor at an annual general meeting, the previous auditor will be deemed to have continued in office. Directors are elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders at an annual general meeting and, pursuant to our articles of association, serve for one-year terms. Any nominee for director who does not receive a majority of the votes cast is not elected to the board. However, because Irish law requires a minimum of two directors at all times, in the event that an election results in no directors being elected, each of the two nominees receiving the greatest number of votes in favor of his or her election shall hold office until his or her successor shall be elected. In the event that an election results in only one director being elected, that director shall be elected and shall serve for a one-year term, and the nominee receiving the greatest number of votes in favor of their election shall hold office until his or her successor shall be elected. 
 If the directors become aware that our net assets are half or less of the amount of our called-up share capital, the directors must convene an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders not later than 28 days from the date that they learn of this fact. This meeting must be convened for the purposes of considering whether any, and if so what, measures should be taken to address the situation. 
 Voting 
 General 
 Where a poll is demanded at a general meeting, every shareholder shall have one vote for each ordinary share that he or she holds as of the record date for the meeting. Voting rights on a poll may be exercised by shareholders registered in our share register as of the record date for the meeting or by a duly appointed proxy of such a registered shareholder, which proxy need not be a shareholder. Where interests in shares are held by a nominee trust company this company may exercise the rights of the beneficial holders on their behalf as their proxy. All proxies must be appointed in the manner prescribed by the Irish Companies Act. Our articles of association permit the appointment of proxies by the shareholders to be notified by us electronically, when permitted by the directors. 

Our articles of association provide that all resolutions shall be decided by a show of hands unless a poll is demanded by the chairman, by at least three shareholders as of the record date for the meeting or by any shareholder or shareholders holding not less than 10 of the total voting rights of ours as of the record date for the meeting. Each of our shareholders of record as of the record date for the meeting has one vote at a general meeting on a show of hands. 
 In accordance with our articles of association, our directors may from time to time cause us to issue preferred shares. These preferred shares may have such voting rights as may be specified in the terms of such preferred shares (e.g., they may carry more votes per share than ordinary shares or may entitle their holders to a class vote on such matters as may be specified in the terms of the preferred shares). 
 Treasury shares will not be entitled to vote at general meetings of shareholders 
 Supermajority Voting 
 Irish company law requires special resolutions of the shareholders at a general meeting to approve certain matters. A special resolution requires not less than 75 of the votes cast by our shareholders at a general meeting. This may be contrasted with ordinary resolutions, which require a simple majority of the votes cast by our shareholders at a general meeting. Examples of matters requiring special resolutions include 
 
 amending our objects 
 amending our memorandum and articles of association 
 approving the change of our name 
 authorizing the entering into of a guarantee or provision of security in connection with a loan, quasi-loan or credit transaction to a director or connected person 
 opting out of pre-emption rights on the issuance of new shares 
 re-registration from a public limited company as a private company 
 variation of class rights attached to classes of shares 
 purchase of own shares off-market 
 the reduction of share capital 
 resolving that we be wound up by the Irish courts resolving in favor of a shareholders voluntary winding-up 
 re-designation of shares into different share classes and 
 setting the re-issue price of treasury shares. 
 A scheme of arrangement with shareholders requires a court order from the Irish High Court and the approval of (1) 75 of the voting shareholders by value and (2) 50 in number of the voting shareholders, at a meeting called to approve the scheme. 
 Variation of Class Rights Attaching to Shares 
 Variation of all or any special rights attached to any class of our shares is addressed in our articles of association as well as the Irish Companies Act. Any variation of class rights attaching to our issued shares must be approved by a special resolution of the shareholders of the class affected. 

Quorum for General Meetings 
 The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of our ordinary shares outstanding which entitle the holders to a majority of the voting power of shares outstanding constitutes a quorum for the conduct of business. No business may take place at a general meeting if a quorum is not present in person or by proxy. The board of directors has no authority to waive quorum requirements stipulated in our articles of association. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum in respect of the proposals. 
 Inspection of Books and Records 
 Under Irish law, shareholders have the right to (1) receive a copy of our memorandum and articles of association and any act of the Irish Government which alters our memorandum of association (2) inspect and obtain copies of our minutes of general meetings and resolutions (3) inspect and receive a copy of the register of shareholders, register of directors and secretaries, register of directors interests and other statutory registers maintained by us (4) receive copies of financial statements and directors and auditors reports which have previously been sent to shareholders prior to an annual general meeting and (5) receive financial statements of a subsidiary company of ours which have previously been sent to shareholders prior to an annual general meeting for the preceding ten years. Our auditors will also have the right to inspect all of our books, records and vouchers. The auditors report must be circulated to the shareholders with our audited financial statements 21 days before the annual general meeting and must be laid before the shareholders at our annual general meeting. 
 Acquisitions and Appraisal Rights 
 There are a number of mechanisms for acquiring an Irish public limited company, including 
 
 a court-approved scheme of arrangement under the Irish Companies Act. A scheme of arrangement with shareholders requires a court order from the Irish High Court and the approval of (1) 75 of the voting shareholders by value and (2) greater than 50 in number of the voting shareholders, at a meeting called to approve the scheme 
 through a tender offer by a third party for all of our shares. Where the holders of 80 or more of our shares have accepted an offer for their shares, the remaining shareholders may be statutorily required to also transfer their shares. If the bidder does not exercise its squeeze out right, then the non-accepting shareholders also have a statutory right to require the bidder to acquire their shares on the same terms. If our shares were listed on Euronext Dublin or another regulated stock exchange in the European Union, this threshold would be increased to 90 and by way of a merger with an EEA-incorporated company under the E.U. Cross Border Merger Directive (Directive 2017 1132 EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies). Such a merger must be approved by a special resolution (there is no statutory merger regime pursuant to Irish law for mergers between an Irish company and a company based outside of the European Economic Area, but Irish law nevertheless allows for the transfer of all assets and liabilities in accordance with an agreement such as the merger agreement). 
 Under Irish law, there is no requirement for a company s shareholders to approve a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of a company s property and assets. However, our articles of association provide that the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares on the relevant record date is required to approve a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of its property or assets. 
 Disclosure of Interests in Shares 
 Under the Irish Companies Act, there is a notification requirement for shareholders who acquire or cease to be interested in 3 of the shares of an Irish public limited company. A shareholder of ours must therefore make such a notification to us if as a result of a transaction the shareholder will be interested in 3 or more of our shares or if as a result of a transaction a shareholder who was interested in more than 3 of our shares ceases to be so interested. Where a shareholder is interested in more than 3 of our shares, any alteration of his or her interest that brings his or her total holding through the nearest whole percentage number, whether an increase or a reduction, 

must be notified to us. The relevant percentage figure is calculated by reference to the aggregate par value of the shares in which the shareholder is interested as a proportion of the entire par value of our share capital. Where the percentage level of the shareholder s interest does not amount to a whole percentage this figure may be rounded down to the next whole number. All such disclosures should be notified to us within 5 business days of the transaction or alteration of the shareholder s interests that gave rise to the requirement to notify. Where a person fails to comply with the notification requirements described above no right or interest of any kind whatsoever in respect of any of our shares concerned, held by such person, shall be enforceable by such person, whether directly or indirectly, by action or legal proceeding. However, such person may apply to the court to have the rights attaching to the shares concerned reinstated. 
 In addition to the above disclosure requirement, under the Irish Companies Act we may by notice in writing require a person whom we know or have reasonable cause to believe to be, or at any time during the three years immediately preceding the date on which such notice is issued, to have been interested in shares comprised in our relevant share capital to (a) indicate whether or not it is the case, and (b) where such person holds or has during that time held an interest in our shares, to give such further information as may be required by us including particulars of such person s own past or present interests in our shares. Any information given in response to the notice is required to be given in writing within such reasonable time as may be specified in the notice. 
 Where such a notice is served by us on a person who is or was interested in our shares and that person fails to give us any information required within the reasonable time specified, we may apply to court for an order directing that the affected shares be subject to certain restrictions. 
 Under the Irish Companies Act, the restrictions that may be placed on the shares by the court are as follows 
 
 any transfer of those shares, or in the case of unissued shares any transfer of the right to be issued with shares and any issue of shares, shall be void 
 no voting rights shall be exercisable in respect of those shares 
 no further shares shall be issued in right of those shares or in pursuance of any offer made to the holder of those shares and 
 no payment shall be made of any sums due from us on those shares, whether in respect of capital or otherwise. 
 Where our shares are subject to these restrictions, the court may order the shares to be sold and may also direct that the shares shall cease to be subject to these restrictions. Failure to comply with such a court order is a criminal offence. 
 Anti-Takeover Provisions 
 Business Combinations with Interested Shareholders 
 Our articles of association include a provision similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested shareholder, unless, in general 
 
 our board of directors approved the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder 
 upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder, the shareholder owned at least 85 of the voting shares outstanding at the time of commencement of such transaction, excluding for purposes of determining the number of voting shares outstanding (but not the outstanding voting shares owned by the interested shareholder), voting shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and by certain employee share plans or 

the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at an annual or extraordinary general meeting of shareholders by a special resolution, excluding for this purpose any votes cast by the interested shareholder. 
 A business combination is generally defined as a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested shareholder. An interested shareholder is generally defined as a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the date in question, owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting shares. 
 Shareholder Rights Plans and Share Issuances 
 Irish law does not expressly prohibit companies from issuing share purchase rights or adopting a shareholder rights plan as an anti-takeover measure. However, there is no directly relevant case law on the validity of such plans under Irish law, and shareholder approval may be required under Irish law to implement such a plan. In addition, such a plan would be subject to the Irish Takeover Rules described below. 
 Subject to the Irish Takeover Rules described below, the board also has power to issue any of our authorized and unissued shares on such terms and conditions as it may determine and any such action should be taken in our best interests. It is possible, however, that the terms and conditions of any issue of preferred shares could discourage a takeover or other transaction that holders of some or a majority of the ordinary shares believe to be in their best interests or in which holders might receive a premium for their shares over the then market price of the shares. The board of directors represents that, it will not, without prior shareholder approval, approve the issuance or use of any of the preferred shares for any defensive or anti-takeover purpose or for the purpose of implementing any shareholder rights plan. Within these limits, the board of directors may approve the issuance or use of preferred shares for capital raising, financing or acquisition needs or opportunities that has the effect of making a takeover of us or other acquisition transactions more difficult or costly, as could also be the case if the board of directors were to issue additional ordinary shares. 
 Irish Takeover Rules and Substantial Acquisition Rules 
 A transaction by virtue of which a third party is seeking to acquire 30 or more of the voting rights of our shares will be governed by the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997 and the Irish Takeover Rules made thereunder and will be regulated by the Irish Takeover Panel. The General Principles of the Irish Takeover Rules and certain important aspects of the Irish Takeover Rules are described below. 
 General Principles 
 The Irish Takeover Rules are built on the following General Principles which will apply to any transaction regulated by the Irish Takeover Panel 
 in the event of an offer, all classes of shareholders of the target company should be afforded equivalent treatment and, if a person acquires control of a company, the other holders of securities must be protected 
 the holders of securities in the target company must have sufficient time to allow them to make an informed decision regarding the offer 
 the board of a company must act in the interests of the company as a whole. If the board of the target company advises the holders of securities as regards the offer it must advise on the effects of the implementation of the offer on employment, employment conditions and the locations of the target company s place of business 
 false markets in the securities of the target company or any other company concerned by the offer must not be created 
 a bidder can only announce an offer after ensuring that he or she can fulfill in full the consideration offered 

a target company may not be hindered longer than is reasonable by an offer for its securities. This is a recognition that an offer will disrupt the day-to-day running of a target company particularly if the offer is hostile and the board of the target company must divert its attention to resist the offer and 
 a substantial acquisition of securities (whether such acquisition is to be effected by one transaction or a series of transactions) will only be allowed to take place at an acceptable speed and shall be subject to adequate and timely disclosure. 
 Mandatory Bid 
 Under certain circumstances, a person who acquires our shares or other voting rights may be required under the Irish Takeover Rules to make a mandatory cash offer for our remaining outstanding shares at a price not less than the highest price paid for the shares by the acquirer (or any parties acting in concert with the acquirer) during the previous 12 months. This mandatory bid requirement is triggered if, unless the Panel otherwise consents, an acquisition of shares would (i) increase the aggregate holding of an acquirer (including the holdings of any parties acting in concert with the acquirer) to shares representing 30 or more of the voting rights in us, or (ii) in the case of a person holding (together with its concert parties) shares representing 30 or more of the voting rights in us, after giving effect to the acquisition, increase the percentage of the voting rights held by that person (together with its concert parties) by 0.05 within a 12-month period. Any person (excluding any parties acting in concert with the holder) holding shares representing more than 50 of the voting rights of a company is not subject to these mandatory offer requirements in purchasing additional securities. 
 Voluntary Bid Requirements to Make a Cash Offer and Minimum Price Requirements 
 A voluntary offer is an offer that is not a mandatory offer. If a bidder or any of its concert parties acquire our ordinary shares within the period of three months prior to the commencement of the offer period, the offer price must be not less than the highest price paid for our ordinary shares by the bidder or its concert parties during that period. The Irish Takeover Panel has the power to extend the look back period to 12 months if the Irish Takeover Panel, having regard to the General Principles, believes it is appropriate to do so. 
 If the bidder or any of its concert parties has acquired our ordinary shares (i) during the period of 12 months prior to the commencement of the offer period which represent more than 10 of our total ordinary shares or (ii) at any time after the commencement of the offer period, the offer shall be in cash (or accompanied by a full cash alternative) and the price per ordinary share shall be not less than the highest price paid by the bidder or its concert parties during, in the case of (i), the period of 12 months prior to the commencement of the offer period and, in the case of (ii), the offer period. The Irish Takeover Panel may apply this rule to a bidder who, together with its concert parties, has acquired less than 10 of our total ordinary shares in the 12-month period prior to the commencement of the offer period if the Panel, having regard to the General Principles, considers it just and proper to do so. 
 An offer period will generally commence from the date of the first announcement of the offer or proposed offer. 
 Substantial Acquisition Rules 
 The Irish Takeover Rules also contain rules governing substantial acquisitions of shares which restrict the speed at which a person may increase his or her holding of shares and rights over shares to an aggregate of between 15 and 30 of the voting rights of our shares. Except in certain circumstances, an acquisition or series of acquisitions of shares or rights over shares representing 10 or more of the voting rights of our shares is prohibited, if such acquisition(s), when aggregated with shares or rights already held, would result in the acquirer holding 15 or more but less than 30 of the voting rights of our shares and such acquisitions are made within a period of seven days. These rules also require accelerated disclosure of acquisitions of shares or rights over shares relating to such holdings. 
 Frustrating Action 
 Under the Irish Takeover Rules, our board of directors is not permitted to take any action which might frustrate an offer for our shares once the board of directors has received an approach which may lead to an offer or 

has reason to believe an offer is imminent except as noted below. Potentially frustrating actions such as (i) the issue of shares, options or convertible securities, or the redemption or purchase of own securities (other than under a contract entered into prior to the announcement of the offer or the board having reason to believe an offer is imminent), (ii) material acquisitions or disposals, (iii) entering into contracts other than in the ordinary course of business or (iv) any action, other than seeking alternative offers, which may result in frustration of an offer, are prohibited during the course of an offer or at any time during which the board has reason to believe an offer is imminent. Exceptions to this prohibition are available where 
 the action is approved by the offeree at a general meeting or 
 with the consent of the Irish Takeover Panel where 
 the Irish Takeover Panel is satisfied the action would not constitute a frustrating action 
 
 the holders of 50 of the voting rights state in writing that they approve the proposed action and would vote in favor of it at a general meeting 
 the action is taken in accordance with a contract entered into prior to the announcement of the offer or 
 the decision to take such action was made before the announcement of the offer and either has been at least partially implemented or is in the ordinary course of business. 
 Corporate Governance 
 Our articles of association delegate the day-to-day management of us to the board of directors. The board of directors may then delegate the management of us to committees, executives or to a management team, but regardless, the directors will remain responsible, as a matter of Irish law, for the proper management of our affairs. 
 Our corporate governance guidelines and general approach to corporate governance as reflected in our memorandum and articles of association and our internal policies and procedures are guided by U.S. practice and applicable federal securities laws and regulations and the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. Although we are an Irish public limited company, we are not subject to the listing rules of Euronext Dublin or the listing rules of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and we are therefore not subject to, nor will we adopt, the U.K. Corporate Governance Code, any guidelines issued by the Investment Association or the Pre-Emption Group Statement of Principles, or any other non-statutory Irish or U.K. governance standards or guidelines. While there are many similarities and overlaps between the U.S. corporate governance standards applied by us and the U.K. Corporate Governance Code and other Irish U.K. governance standards or guidelines, there are differences, in particular relating to the extent of the authorization to issue share capital and effect share repurchases that may be granted to the board and the criteria for determining the independence of directors. 
 Duration Dissolution Rights upon Liquidation 
 Our duration is unlimited. We may be dissolved and wound up at any time by way of either a shareholders voluntary winding up or a creditors winding up. In the case of a shareholders voluntary winding up, the consent of not less than 75 of the votes cast by our shareholders is required. We may also be dissolved by way of court order on the application of a creditor or the Director of Corporate Enforcement (where the court is satisfied on a petition of the Director of Corporate Enforcement that it is in the public interest that we should be would up), or by the Companies Registration Office (by way of strike-off) as an enforcement measure where we have failed to file certain returns. 
 The rights of the shareholders to a return of our assets on dissolution or winding up, following the settlement of all claims of creditors, may be prescribed in our memorandum and articles of association or the terms of any preferred shares issued by our directors from time to time. The holders of preferred shares in particular may have the right to priority in a dissolution or winding up of us. If the articles of association contain no specific provisions in respect of a dissolution or winding up then, subject to the priorities of any creditors, the assets will be distributed to shareholders in proportion to the paid-up par value of the shares held. Our articles of association provide that our 

ordinary shareholders are entitled to participate pro rata in a winding up, but their right to do so may be subject to the rights of any preferred shareholders to participate under the terms of any series or class of preferred shares. 
 Stock Exchange Listing 
 Our ordinary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JCI . 
 Uncertificated Shares 
 Pursuant to the Irish Companies Act a shareholder is entitled to be issued a share certificate on request and subject to payment of a nominal fee. 
 Transfer and Registration of Shares 
 Our share register is maintained by its transfer agent. Registration in this share register is determinative of membership in us. A shareholder of ours who holds shares beneficially is not the holder of record of such shares. Instead, the depository (for example, Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC) or other nominee is the holder of record of such shares. Accordingly, a transfer of shares from a person who holds such shares beneficially to a person who also holds such shares beneficially through the same depository or other nominee will not be registered in our official share register, as the depository or other nominee will remain the record holder of such shares. 
 A written instrument of transfer is required under Irish law in order to register on our official share register any transfer of shares (i) from a person who holds such shares directly to any other person, (ii) from a person who holds such shares beneficially to a person who holds such shares directly, or (iii) from a person who holds such shares beneficially to another person who holds such shares beneficially where the transfer involves a change in the depository or other nominee that is the record owner of the transferred shares. An instrument of transfer also is required for a shareholder who directly holds shares to transfer those shares into his or her own broker account (or vice versa). Such instruments of transfer may give rise to Irish stamp duty, which must be paid prior to registration of the transfer on our official Irish share register. 
 We may, in our absolute discretion, pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay any stamp duty. Our articles of association provide that, in the event of any such payment, we shall be entitled to (i) seek reimbursement from the buyer, (ii) set-off the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares, and (iii) claim a first and permanent lien on our ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares. Parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in our ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by us. 
 Our articles of association delegate to our Secretary (or his or her nominee) the authority to execute an instrument of transfer on behalf of a transferring party. In order to help ensure that the official share register is regularly updated to reflect trading of our ordinary shares occurring through normal electronic systems, we regularly produce any required instruments of transfer in connection with any transactions for which we pay stamp duty (subject to the reimbursement and set-off rights described above). In the event that we notify one or both of the parties to a share transfer that we believe stamp duty is required to be paid in connection with such transfer and that we will not pay such stamp duty, such parties may either themselves arrange for the execution of the required instrument of transfer (and may request a form of instrument of transfer from us for this purpose) or request that we execute an instrument of transfer on behalf of the transferring party in a form determined by us. In either event, if the parties to the share transfer have the instrument of transfer duly stamped (to the extent required) and then provide it to our transfer agent, the transferee will be registered as the legal owner of the relevant shares on our official Irish share register (subject to the matters described below). 
 Our directors have general discretion to decline to register an instrument of transfer unless the transfer is in respect of one class of shares only, the instrument of transfer is accompanied by the certificate of shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer, a fee of 10 or such lesser sum is paid to us, the instrument of transfer is in favor of not more than four transferees and it is lodged at our registered office or such other place as the board of directors may appoint. 

The registration of transfers may be suspended by the directors at such times and for such period, not exceeding in the whole 30 days in each year, as the directors may from time to time determine. 
 Formation Fiscal Year Registered Office 
 We were incorporated in Ireland as a public limited company on May 9, 2014 (under the name Tyco International plc with company registration number 543654. Our fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year and our registered address is One Albert Quay, Cork, T12 X8N6, Ireland. 
 No Sinking Fund 
 The ordinary shares have no sinking fund provisions. 
 No Liability for Further Calls or Assessments 
 When the ordinary shares are issued, they will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

 following the delivery of the opinion described in the previous bullet point, JCI plc provides notice of redemption not less than 30 days, but not more than 90 days, prior to the redemption date. The notice of redemption cannot be given more than 90 days before the earliest date on which JCI plc would be otherwise required to pay Additional Amounts, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must still be in effect when the notice is given. 
 Upon the occurrence of each of the bullet points above, JCI plc may redeem the JCI plc Notes of such series at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). 
 The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any Successor Person (as defined below) to JCI plc. 
 Notice of Redemption 
 Notice of any redemption will be mailed, or delivered electronically if the JCI plc Notes are held by any depositary, at least 30 days but not more than 90 days before the date fixed for such redemption to each holder of JCI plc Notes of a series to be redeemed. If less than all the JCI plc Notes of such series are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the outstanding JCI plc Notes of such series to be redeemed in accordance with a method that complies with the requirements, if any, of any stock exchange on which 

such JCI plc Notes are listed, and the applicable procedures of the depositary, if the JCI plc Notes of such series are held by any depositary provided, however, that with respect to any JCI plc Notes not listed on any stock exchange and or held by a depositary, the Trustee will select such JCI plc Notes by lot or by such other method that the Trustee considers fair and appropriate. 
 Interest on such JCI plc Notes or portions of JCI plc Notes will cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless JCI plc defaults in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest (if any) with respect to any such JCI plc Note or portion thereof. 
 If any redemption date of any JCI plc Note is not a business day, then payment of principal and interest may be made on the next succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on the nominal redemption date and no interest will accrue for the period after such nominal date. 
 Payment of Additional Amounts 
 All payments in respect of the JCI plc Notes will be made by JCI plc free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is required by law. 
 In the event that JCI plc is required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of Ireland or any other jurisdiction (other than the United States of America) in which JCI plc is organized, resident or doing business for tax purposes or from or through which payments by or on behalf of JCI plc are made, or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein (each, but not including the United States of America or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein, a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to any JCI plc Note, JCI plc will pay such additional amounts Additional Amounts so that the net amount received by each holder of JCI plc Notes (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will equal the amount that such holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted. 
 Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to a payment made to a holder of JCI plc Notes or a holder of beneficial interests in Global Securities where such holder is subject to taxation on such payment by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction for any reason other than such Person's mere ownership of the JCI plc Notes or beneficial interests or for or on account of 
 any Taxes that are imposed or withheld solely because such holder or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, or member of such holder if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or a Person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder 
 is or was present or engaged in, or is or was treated as present or engaged in, a trade or business in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or has or had a permanent establishment in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction 
 has or had any present or former connection (other than the mere fact of ownership of such JCI plc Notes) with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, including being or having been a national citizen or resident thereof, being treated as being or having been a resident thereof or being or having been physically present therein 
 any estate, inheritance, gift, transfer, excise, personal property or similar Taxes imposed with respect to the JCI plc Notes 
 any Taxes imposed solely as a result of the presentation of such JCI plc Notes, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficiary or holder thereof would have been entitled to the payment of Additional Amounts had such JCI plc Notes been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period 
 any Taxes imposed or withheld solely as a result of the failure of such holder or any other Person to comply with applicable certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Taxes 
 any Taxes that are payable by any method other than withholding or deduction by JCI plc or any paying agent from payments in respect of such JCI plc Notes 
 any Taxes required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment in respect of any JCI plc Notes if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent 
 any withholding or deduction for Taxes which would not have been imposed if the relevant JCI plc Notes had been presented to another paying agent in a Member State of the European Union 

any withholding or deduction required pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any amended or successor provisions), any regulations, rules, practices or agreements entered into pursuant thereto, official interpretations thereof or any law implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto or 
 any combination of the above conditions. 
 Additional Amounts also will not be payable to any holder of JCI plc Notes or the holder of a beneficial interest in a global JCI plc Note that is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or to such holder that is not the sole holder of such JCI plc Note or holder of such beneficial interests in such JCI plc Note, as the case may be. This exception, however, will apply only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment. 
 JCI plc also 
 will make such withholding or deduction of Taxes 
 will remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with all applicable laws 
 will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each relevant tax authority imposing such Taxes certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld and 
 upon request, will make available to the holders of the JCI plc Notes, within 90 days after the date the payment of any Taxes deducted or withheld is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by JCI plc (unless, notwithstanding JCI plc's efforts to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable). 
 At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the JCI plc Notes of a series is due and payable, if JCI plc will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, JCI plc will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and such other information as is necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to holders of such JCI plc Notes on the payment date. 
 In addition, JCI plc will pay any stamp, issue, registration, documentary or other similar taxes and duties, including interest, penalties and Additional Amounts with respect thereto, payable in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of the creation, issue, offering, enforcement, redemption or retirement of the JCI plc Notes. 
 The foregoing provisions shall survive any termination or the discharge of the JCI plc Indenture and shall apply mutatis mutandis to any Successor Person to JCI plc. 
 Whenever in the JCI plc Indenture, any JCI plc Notes, or in this Description of JCI plc Notes there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, redemption price, repurchase price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any JCI plc Notes, such mention shall be deemed to include the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent payable in the particular context. 
 Offer to Repurchase Upon Change of Control Triggering Event 
 Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to a series of JCI plc Notes (other than the 6.000 Notes due 2036 and the 6.950 Debentures due December 1, 2045), unless we have exercised our right to redeem the JCI plc Notes of such series by giving irrevocable notice on or prior to the 30th day after the Change of Control Triggering Event in accordance with the JCI plc Indenture, each holder of JCI plc Notes of such series will have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of such holder's JCI plc Notes of such series pursuant to the offer described below (the Change of Control Offer ), at a purchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (the Change of Control Payment ). If the Change of Control Payment Date (as defined below) falls on a day that is not a business day, the related payment of the Change of Control Payment will be made on the next business day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for the period from and after such date to the next business day. 
 Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurs or, at our option, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the pending Change of Control, we will be required to send, by first class mail, or deliver electronically if the applicable JCI plc Notes are held by any depositary, a notice to each holder of JCI plc Notes of the applicable series, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice will govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice will state, 

among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered electronically (or, in the case of a notice mailed or delivered electronically prior to the date of consummation of a Change of Control, no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date of the Change of Control Triggering Event), other than as may be required by law (the Change of Control Payment Date ). The notice, if mailed or delivered electronically prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, will state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. 
 On the Change of Control Payment Date, we will, to the extent lawful 
 accept or cause a third party to accept for payment all JCI plc Notes of the applicable series properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer 
 deposit or cause a third party to deposit with the applicable paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all JCI plc Notes of the applicable series properly tendered and 
 deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the JCI plc Notes of the applicable series properly accepted together with an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of JCI plc Notes of each series being repurchased. 
 We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the JCI plc Notes of the applicable series if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by us and such third party purchases all the JCI plc Notes of the applicable series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, we will not repurchase any JCI plc Notes of the applicable series if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the JCI plc Indenture, other than a Default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment on the Change of Control Payment Date. 
 We must comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the JCI plc Notes of the applicable series as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the JCI plc Notes of the applicable series, we will be required to comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the JCI plc Notes of such series by virtue of any such conflict. 
 The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of JCI plc and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise, established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the applicability of the requirement that we offer to repurchase the JCI plc Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of JCI plc and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) may be uncertain. 
 Other Provisions of the JCI plc Euro Notes 
 Claims against JCI plc for the payment of principal or Additional Amounts, if any, of the JCI plc Euro Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against JCI plc for the payment of interest, if any, of the JCI plc Euro Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

 Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions 
 JCI plc will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and Lease-Back Transaction unless

 Merger and Consolidation 
 JCI plc will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets in one or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless 
 (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the Successor Person will be a corporation, limited liability company, public limited company, limited partnership or other entity organized and existing under the laws of (u) the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, (v) Ireland, (w) England and Wales, (x) Jersey, (y) any member state of the European Union as in effect on the date the JCI plc Notes of the applicable series are first issued or (z) Switzerland provided that the Successor Person (if not JCI plc) will expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of JCI plc under the JCI plc Notes of the applicable series and the JCI plc Indenture 
 (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor Person or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been incurred by the Successor Person or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing and 
 (3) JCI plc shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel under the JCI plc Indenture, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the JCI plc Indenture.

Reports by JCI plc 
 So long as any JCI plc Notes are outstanding, JCI plc shall file with the Trustee, within 15 days after JCI plc is required to file with the SEC, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) that JCI plc may be required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. JCI plc shall be deemed to have complied with the previous sentence to the extent that such information, documents and reports are filed with the SEC via EDGAR, or any successor electronic delivery procedure provided, however, that the Trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to determine whether or not such information, documents or reports have been filed pursuant to the EDGAR system (or its successor). Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including JCI plc's compliance with any of its covenants under the JCI plc Indenture (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer's Certificates). 
 JCI plc will furnish to the Trustee on or before 120 days after the end of each fiscal year an Officer's Certificate stating that in the course of the performance by the signers of their duties as Officers of JCI plc, they would normally have knowledge of any Default by JCI plc in the performance or fulfillment or observance of any covenants or agreements contained in the JCI plc Indenture during the preceding fiscal year, stating whether or not they have knowledge of any such Default and, if so, specifying each such Default of which the signers have knowledge and the nature thereof. 
 Listing 
 The JCI plc Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We have no obligation to maintain such listing, and we may delist the JCI plc Notes at any time. 
 Events of Default 
 As to any series of JCI plc Notes, an Event of Default means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body) 
 (1) failure to pay any interest on the JCI plc Notes of that series when due, which failure continues for 30 days 
 (2) failure to pay principal or premium, if any, with respect to the JCI plc Notes of that series when due 
 (3) failure on the part of JCI plc to observe or perform any other covenant, warranty or agreement in the JCI plc Notes of that series, or in the JCI plc Indenture as it relates to the JCI plc Notes of that series, other than a covenant, warranty or agreement, a Default in whose performance or whose breach is specifically dealt with elsewhere in the section of the JCI plc Indenture governing Events of Default, if the failure continues for 90 days after written notice by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the JCI plc Notes of that series then outstanding 
 (4) an Event of Default with respect to any other series of debt securities issued under the JCI plc Indenture or an uncured or unwaived failure to pay principal of or interest on any of our other obligations for borrowed money beyond any period of grace with respect thereto if, in either case, (a) the aggregate principal amount thereof is in excess of 200,000,000 and (b) the default in payment is not being contested by us in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and 
 (5) specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization. 
 However, the Event of Default in clause (4) above is subject to the following 
 if such Event of Default with respect to such other series of debt securities issued under the JCI plc Indenture or such default in payment with respect to such other obligations for borrowed money shall be remedied or cured by JCI plc or waived by the requisite holders of such other series of debt securities or such other obligations for borrowed money, then the Event of Default under the JCI plc Indenture by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon remedied, cured or waived without further action upon the part of either the Trustee or any of the holders of JCI plc Notes and 
 subject to certain duties, responsibilities and rights of the Trustee under the JCI plc Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any such Event of Default with respect to such other series of debt securities issued under the JCI plc Indenture or such payment default with respect to such other obligations for borrowed money unless written notice thereof shall have been given to a Trust Officer of the Trustee by JCI plc, by the holder or an agent of the holder of 

such other obligations for borrowed money, by the trustee then acting under any indenture or other instrument under which such payment default with respect to such other obligations for borrowed money shall have occurred, or by the holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of such other series. 
 Notice and Declaration of Defaults 
 The JCI plc Indenture provides that the Trustee will, within the later of 90 days after the occurrence of a Default with respect to any series for which there are JCI plc Notes outstanding which is continuing and which is known to a Trust Officer of the Trustee, or 60 days after such Default is actually known to such Trust Officer of the Trustee or written notice of such Default is received by the Trustee, give to the holders of such JCI plc Notes notice, by mail as the names and addresses of such holders appear on the security register, or electronically if such JCI plc Notes are held by any depositary, of all uncured Defaults known to it, including events specified above without grace periods, unless such Defaults shall have been cured before the giving of such notice provided, that except in the case of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the JCI plc Notes of any series, or in the payment of any sinking fund installment with respect to the JCI plc Notes of any series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice to the holders if the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding of such notice is in the interests of the holders of the JCI plc Notes of such series. 
 The Trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding JCI plc Notes of any series may declare the JCI plc Notes of that series immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any Event of Default. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding JCI plc Notes of all series issued under the JCI plc Indenture and any supplement thereto affected by such waiver (voting as one class), on behalf of the holders of all of the JCI plc Notes of all such series, may waive any existing Default and its consequences, except a Default in the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, including sinking fund payments (provided, however, that only holders of a majority in principal amount of the JCI plc Notes of an applicable series may rescind an acceleration with respect to such series and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration). 
 Actions upon Default 
 In case an Event of Default with respect to any series of JCI plc Notes occurs and is continuing, the JCI plc Indenture provides that the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the JCI plc Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the holders of JCI plc Notes outstanding of any series unless the applicable holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable security and indemnity, satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion, against any loss, liability or expense which may be incurred thereby. The right of a holder to institute a proceeding with respect to the JCI plc Notes of the applicable series is subject to conditions precedent including notice and indemnity to the Trustee, but the right of any holder of any applicable JCI plc Note to receive payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on their due dates or to institute suit for the enforcement thereof shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder.

 General 
 The Notes constitute separate series and are JCI plc s and the Co-Issuer s unsecured, unsubordinated obligations. The Notes rank senior in right of payment to JCI plc s and the Co-Issuer s existing and future indebtedness and other obligations that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes equal in right of payment to JCI plc s and the Co-Issuer s existing and future indebtedness and other obligations that are not so subordinated effectively junior to any of JCI plc s and the Co-Issuer s secured indebtedness and other obligations to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness or other obligations and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations incurred by JCI plc s and the Co-Issuer s subsidiaries. TFSCA is not a co-issuer in respect of JCI plc s outstanding senior notes other than the 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2029 Notes, 2030 Notes, 2031 Notes, 2032 USD Notes, 2032 Euro Notes and 2035 Notes.

Indenture May Be Used for Future Issuances 
 We may, without the consent of the then existing holders of the Notes, re-open and issue additional Notes of any series, which additional Notes will have the same terms as such series of Notes except for the issue price, issue date and, under some circumstances, the first interest payment date provided that, if such additional Notes are not fungible with the existing Notes of such series for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional Notes will have a separate CUSIP, ISIN and or other identifying number, as applicable. Additional Notes issued in this manner will form a single series with the applicable series of Notes. 
 In addition, the Indenture does not limit the amount of debt securities that can be issued thereunder and provides that debt securities of any series may be issued thereunder up to the aggregate principal amount that we may authorize from time to time. All debt securities issued as a series, including those issued pursuant to any reopening of a series, will vote together as a single class. Debt securities issued pursuant to the Indenture may have terms that differ from those of the Notes, as set forth in Section 2.01 of the Indenture. 
 Issuance of Notes in Euros 
 All payments of interest and principal, including payments made upon any redemption or repurchase of the Euro Notes, are payable in euros.

In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euros will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the then most recent U.S. dollar euro exchange rate available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date as determined by the Issuers in their sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the Euro Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default (as defined below) under the Euro Notes or the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.

 Certain definitions with respect to the Optional Redemption provisions of the 2029 Notes 
 
 Treasury Rate means, with respect to any redemption date for the 2029 Notes, the yield determined by JCI plc in accordance with the following two paragraphs. The Treasury Rate shall be determined by JCI plc after 4 15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third business day preceding the redemption date based 

upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as Selected Interest Rates (Daily) H.15 (or any successor designation or publication) H.15 under the caption U.S. government securities Treasury constant maturities Nominal (or any successor caption or heading) H.15 TCM ). In determining the Treasury Rate, JCI plc shall select, as applicable (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the redemption date to the 2029 Par Call Date (the Remaining Life or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life, the two yields one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life and shall interpolate to the 2029 Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life, the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years, as applicable, of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date. 
 
 If on the third business day preceding the redemption date H.15 TCM is no longer published, JCI plc shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11 00 a.m., New York City time, on the second business day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on, or with a maturity that is closest to, the 2029 Par Call Date, as applicable. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the 2029 Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the 2029 Par Call Date, one with a maturity date preceding the 2029 Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the 2029 Par Call Date, JCI plc shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the 2029 Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the 2029 Par Call Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, JCI plc shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11 00 a.m., New York City time.

 Comparable Redemption Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of such series of the 2030 Notes, 2031 Notes and 2032 USD Notes to be redeemed if such series matured on the par call date applicable to such series that would be utilized at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to such remaining term of the applicable series of the 2030 Notes, 2031 Notes and 2032 USD Notes, as applicable. 
 Comparable Redemption Treasury Price, with respect to any redemption date for the 2030 Notes, 2031 Notes and 2032 USD Notes, means (i) the average of the Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (unless there is more than one highest or lowest quotation, in which case only one such highest and or lowest quotation shall be excluded), or (ii) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Redemption Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations.

 Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes 
 Either or both of the Issuers may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes of a series under the following conditions 
 if there is an amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) or any change in the written application or official written interpretation of such laws or regulations, including any action taken by, or a change in published administrative practice of, a taxing authority or a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction, regardless of whether such action, change or holding is with respect to either or both of the Issuers, which amendment or change is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after the date of issuance of such series of Notes (or, in the case of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after such date of issuance, after such later date) 
 as a result of such amendment or change, either or both of the Issuers become, or there is a material probability that either or both of the Issuers will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts (as defined below), on the next payment date with respect to such series of Notes, and such Issuer cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available (including having the other Issuer make payments on the Notes if such action would be reasonable) 
 the relevant Issuer (or Issuers) delivers to the Trustee a written opinion of independent tax counsel to such Issuer (or Issuers) of recognized standing to the effect that such Issuer (or Issuers) has become, or there is a material probability that it will become, obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a change or amendment described above in addition, before the Issuer (or Issuers) mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described below, it will deliver to the Trustee an officer s certificate to the effect that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by such Issuer by taking reasonable measures available (including having the other Issuer make payments on the Notes if such action would be reasonable) and 
 following the delivery of the opinion described in the previous bullet point, the relevant Issuer (or Issuers) provides notice of redemption for such series of Notes not less than 10 days, but not more than 90 days, prior to the redemption date. The notice of redemption cannot be given more than 90 days before the earliest date on which the Issuer (or Issuers) would be otherwise required to pay Additional Amounts, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must still be in effect when the notice is given . 

Upon the occurrence of each of the bullet points above, the relevant Issuer (or Issuers) may redeem such series of Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and that will become due on such redemption date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is prior to the redemption date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof). 
 The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any Successor Company or Successor Co-Issuer (each as defined below). 
 Notice of Redemption 
 
 Notice of any redemption of any series of Notes will be mailed, or delivered electronically if the Notes to be redeemed are held by any depositary, at least 10 days but not more than 90 days before the date fixed for such redemption to each holder of Notes to be redeemed. For the 2029 Notes, any redemption notice may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of one or more conditions precedent. In that case, such notice shall state the nature of such condition precedent. 
 
 If less than all of a series of Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select the outstanding Notes of such series to be redeemed in accordance with a method that complies with the requirements, if any, of any stock exchange on which the Notes of such series are listed, and the applicable procedures of the depositary, if such Notes are held by any depositary provided, however, that with respect to any series of Notes not listed on any stock exchange and or held by a depositary, the Trustee will select such Notes by lot or by such other method that the Trustee considers fair and appropriate. 
 No Euro Notes of a principal amount of 100,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. No USD Notes of a principal amount of 2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. Unless the Issuers default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. Additionally, at any time, the Issuers may repurchase Notes in the open market and may hold such Notes or surrender such Notes to the trustee for cancellation. 
 If any redemption date of any Note is not a business day, then payment of principal and interest may be made on the next succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on the nominal redemption date and no interest will accrue for the period after such nominal date. 
 Payment of Additional Amounts 
 All payments in respect of the Notes will be made by (or on behalf of) the Issuers free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (including, without limitation, penalties and interest and other similar liabilities related thereto) Taxes ), unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is required by law. 
 In the event that the Issuers are required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of Ireland, Luxembourg or any other jurisdiction (other than the United States) in which either of the Issuers is incorporated, resident or doing business for tax purposes or from or through which payments by or on behalf of the Issuers are made, or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein (each, but not including the United States or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein, a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction ), from any payment made under or with respect to any Note (including, without limitation, payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium), the Issuers will pay such additional amounts Additional Amounts so that the net amount received by each holder or beneficial owner of Notes (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will equal the amount that such holder or beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted. 

Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner of Notes or a holder of beneficial interests in Global Securities where such holder or beneficial owner is subject to taxation on such payment by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction for or on account of 
 any Taxes that are imposed or withheld because such holder or beneficial owner (or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, or member of such holder or beneficial owner if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, or a Person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder) (i) is or was present or engaged in, or is or was treated as present or engaged in, a trade or business in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or has or had a permanent establishment or other taxable presence in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or (ii) has or had any present or former connection (other than the mere fact of ownership of such Notes) with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, including being or having been a national citizen or resident thereof, being treated as being or having been a resident thereof or being or having been physically present therein 
 any estate, inheritance, gift, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes imposed with respect to the Notes 
 any Taxes imposed as a result of the presentation of such Notes, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficiary or holder thereof would have been entitled to the payment of Additional Amounts had such Notes been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period 
 any Taxes imposed or withheld as a result of the failure of such holder or beneficial owner, upon a written request, made to the holder or beneficial owner in writing at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be made, by an Issuer, broker or other withholding agent, to timely and accurately comply (to the extent such holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so) with any applicable certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection of the holder or beneficial owner with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Taxes 
 any Taxes that are payable by any method other than withholding or deduction by the Issuers or any paying agent from payments in respect of such Notes 
 (with respect to the 2027 Notes and the 2032 Euro Notes) has presented the Notes for payment through a bank, encashment agent or paying agent and a withholding or deduction for Taxes arises which would not have been imposed if the Notes had been presented to another bank, encashment agent or paying agent in a different Member State of the European Union 
 any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), as of the issue date of the Notes (or any amended or successor provisions of such sections that are substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any regulations thereunder or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any law or regulation implemented pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing or 
 any combination of the above. 
 Additional Amounts also will not be payable for any Taxes that are imposed with respect to any payment on a Note to any holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that no Additional Amounts would have been payable had the beneficial owner of the applicable Note been the holder of such Note. 
 The Issuers also 
 will make such withholding or deduction of Taxes 

will remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with all applicable laws 
 will use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each relevant tax authority imposing such Taxes certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld and 
 upon request, will make available to the holders of the Notes, within 90 days after the date the payment of any Taxes deducted or withheld is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Issuers (unless, notwithstanding the Issuers efforts to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, in which case the Issuers will provide other evidence of payments by the Issuers). 
 
 At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable, if the Issuers will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the Issuers will deliver to the Trustee an Officer s Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and such other information as is necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to holders of such Notes on the payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 30 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Issuers may deliver such Officer s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). 
 In addition, the Issuers will pay for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, property, excise, transfer, court or documentary or other similar Taxes and duties, including interest, penalties and Additional Amounts with respect thereto, payable in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of the creation, execution, issue, offering, enforcement, redemption or retirement of the Notes or any other document or instrument referred to therein, or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto. 
 Upon the Issuers request, each holder and beneficial owner shall provide a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8, as applicable, as would have been applicable if the Issuers were incorporated in the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia. 
 The foregoing provisions shall survive any termination or the discharge of the Indenture and shall apply mutatis mutandis to any Successor Company or Successor Co-Issuer. 
 Whenever in the Indenture, any Notes, or in this Description of JCI plc and TFSCA Notes there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, redemption price, repurchase price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Notes, such mention shall be deemed to include the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent payable in the particular context. 
 Offer to Repurchase Upon Change of Control Triggering Event 
 Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, unless we have exercised our right to redeem the Notes of such series as described above under Optional Redemption , each holder of the Notes will have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion (equal to 100,000 or an integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the Euro Notes, and equal to 2,000 or an integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the USD Notes) of such holder s Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the Change of Control Offer ), at a purchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (the Change of Control Payment ). If the Change of Control Payment Date (as defined below) falls on a day that is not a business day, the related payment of the Change of Control Payment will be made on the next business day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for the period from and after such date to the next business day. 
 Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurs or, at our option, prior to and conditioned on the occurrence of, any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the pending Change of Control, we will be required to send, by first class mail, or deliver electronically if the Notes are held by any depositary, a notice to each holder of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice will govern the 

terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice will state, among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered electronically (or, in the case of a notice mailed or delivered electronically prior to the date of consummation of a Change of Control, no earlier than the date of the occurrence of the Change of Control), other than as may be required by law (the Change of Control Payment Date ). The notice, if mailed or delivered electronically prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, will state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. 
 On the Change of Control Payment Date, we will, to the extent lawful 
 accept or cause a third party to accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer 
 deposit or cause a third party to deposit with the applicable paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes properly tendered and 
 deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes being repurchased. 
 We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by us and such third party purchases all the Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, we will not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a Default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment on the Change of Control Payment Date. 
 We must comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, we will be required to comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Indenture with respect to the Notes by virtue of any such conflict. 
 The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of JCI plc and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise, established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the applicability of the requirement that we offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of JCI plc and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) may be uncertain. 
 Other Provisions of the Notes 
 Claims against the Issuers for the payment of principal or Additional Amounts, if any, of the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuers for the payment of interest, if any, of the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

 Events of Default 
 As to the Notes of each series, an Event of Default means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body) 
 (1) failure to pay any interest on the Notes of such series when due, which failure continues for 30 days 
 (2) failure to pay principal or premium, if any, with respect to the Notes of such series when due 
 (3) failure on the part of the Issuers to observe or perform any other covenant, warranty or agreement in the Notes of such series, or in the Indenture as it relates to the Notes of such series, other than a covenant, warranty or agreement, a Default in whose performance or whose breach is specifically dealt with elsewhere in the section of the Indenture governing Events of Default, if the failure continues for 90 days after written notice by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25 (or 30 , solely in the case of the 2029 Notes and the 2035 Notes) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding 

(4) an Event of Default with respect to any other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture or an uncured or unwaived failure to pay principal of or interest on any of our other obligations for borrowed money beyond any period of grace with respect thereto if, in either case, (a) the aggregate principal amount thereof is in excess of 300,000,000 and (b) the default in payment is not being contested by us in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and 
 (5) specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization. 
 However, the Event of Default in clause (4) above is subject to the following 
 if such Event of Default with respect to such other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture or such default in payment with respect to such other obligations for borrowed money shall be remedied or cured by the Issuers or waived by the requisite holders of such other series of debt securities or such other obligations for borrowed money, then the Event of Default under the Indenture by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon remedied, cured or waived without further action upon the part of either the Trustee or any of the holders of Notes of such series and 
 subject to certain duties, responsibilities and rights of the Trustee under the Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any such Event of Default with respect to such other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture or such payment default with respect to such other obligations for borrowed money unless written notice thereof shall have been given to a Trust Officer of the Trustee by the Issuers, by the holder or an agent of the holder of such other obligations for borrowed money, by the trustee then acting under any indenture or other instrument under which such payment default with respect to such other obligations for borrowed money shall have occurred, or by the holders of not less than 25 (or 30 , solely in the case of the 2029 Notes and the 2035 Notes) in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of such other series. 
 Notice and Declaration of Defaults 
 The Indenture provides that the Trustee will, within the later of 90 days after the occurrence of a Default with respect to any Notes of a series outstanding which is continuing and which is known to a Trust Officer of the Trustee, or 60 days after such Default is actually known to such Trust Officer of the Trustee or written notice of such Default is received by the Trustee, give to the holders of the Notes of such series notice, by mail as the names and addresses of such holders appear on the security register, or electronically if the Notes of such series are held by any depositary, of all uncured Defaults known to it, including events specified above without grace periods, unless such Defaults shall have been cured before the giving of such notice provided that, except in the case of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Notes of a series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice to the holders if the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding of such notice is in the interests of the holders of the Notes of such series. 
 The Trustee or the holders of not less than 25 (or 30 , solely in the case of the 2029 Notes and the 2035 Notes) in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of a series may declare the Notes of such series immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any Event of Default. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all series issued under the Base Indenture affected by such waiver (voting as one class), on behalf of the holders of all of the debt securities of all such series, may waive any existing Default and its consequences, except a Default in the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, including sinking fund payments (provided, however, that only holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of an applicable series may rescind an acceleration with respect to such series and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration). 
 Actions upon Default 
 In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes of a series occurs and is continuing, the Indenture provides that the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the holders of Notes of such series unless the applicable holders have offered to 

the Trustee security and indemnity, satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion, against any loss, liability or expense which may be incurred thereby. The right of a holder of any Note of a series to institute a proceeding with respect to the Notes of such series is subject to conditions precedent including notice and indemnity to the Trustee, but the right of any holder of any Note of such series to receive payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on their due dates or to institute suit for the enforcement thereof shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder. 
 The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of a series outstanding will have the right to direct the time, method and place for conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any power or trust conferred on the Trustee. Any direction by such holders will be in accordance with law and the provisions of the Indenture. Subject to certain provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith, by a Trust Officer or Trust Officers of the Trustee, shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed may not be lawfully taken, would involve the Trustee in personal liability, would be materially or unjustly prejudicial to the rights of holders of Notes of such series not joining in such direction or would be unduly prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the debt securities issued under the Base Indenture of all series not joining in the giving of such direction. The Trustee will be under no obligation to act in accordance with any such direction unless the applicable holders offer the Trustee reasonable security and indemnity, satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion, against costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred thereby. 
 Modification of the Indenture 
 The Issuers and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture, which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect, without the consent of the holders of the Notes, for one or more of the following purposes 
 to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the Indenture or the Notes, including making any such changes as are required for the Indenture to comply with the Trust Indenture Act 
 to add an additional obligor on the Notes or to add a guarantor of the Notes, or to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company or the Co-Issuer or any additional obligor or guarantor of the Notes, or successive successions, and the assumption by any Successor Company or Successor Co-Issuer of the covenants, agreements and obligations of such Company, Co-Issuer or such obligor or guarantor, as the case may be, pursuant to provisions in the Indenture concerning consolidation, merger, the sale of assets or successor entities 
 to provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of certificated debt securities provided, that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code) 
 to add to the covenants of the Issuers for the benefit of the holders of all or any series of Notes (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all outstanding series of debt securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or to surrender any of the Issuers rights or powers under the Indenture 
 to add any additional Events of Default for the benefit of the holders of the Notes of all or any series of Notes (and if such Events of Default are to be applicable to less than all outstanding series, stating that such Events of Default are expressly being included solely to be applicable to such series) 
 to change or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture, provided that any such change or elimination shall not become effective with respect to any outstanding Notes created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture which is entitled to the benefit of such provision 
 to secure the Notes 
 to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of the Notes in any material respect 

to provide for the issuance of and establish the form and terms and conditions of a series of debt securities, to provide which, if any, of the covenants of the Issuers shall apply to such series, to provide which of the events of default set forth in the Base Indenture shall apply to such series, to add a co-issuer, to name one or more guarantors and provide for guarantees of such series, to provide for the terms and conditions upon which the guarantee by any guarantor of such series may be released or terminated, or to define the rights of the holders of such series of debt securities 
 to issue additional Notes to the extent permitted by the Indenture provided that such additional Notes have the same terms as, and be deemed part of the same series as, the applicable series of Notes to the extent required under the Indenture or 
 to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture by a successor Trustee with respect to the Notes and to add to or change any of the provisions of the Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trust thereunder by more than one Trustee. 
 In addition, under the Indenture, with the consent (evidenced as provided in the Indenture) of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all series affected by such supplemental indenture or indentures (voting as one class), the Issuers and the Trustee from time to time and at any time may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture thereto or of modifying in any manner not covered by the immediately preceding paragraph the rights of the holders of the debt securities of each such series under the Indenture. However, the following changes may only be made with the consent of each holder of outstanding Notes of a series affected 
 extend a fixed maturity of or any installment of principal of any Notes or reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the amount of principal of any original issue discount security that would be due and payable upon declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof

 reduce the aforesaid percentage of the Notes, the holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture or indentures. 
 A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant, event of default set forth in the Base Indenture or other provision of the Indenture that has been expressly included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of debt securities, if any, or which modifies the rights of the holders of debt securities of such series with respect to such covenant, event of default or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under the Indenture of the holders of debt securities of any other series. 
 Notwithstanding anything herein or otherwise, the provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers obligation to make any offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event as provided in Section 4.08 of the Base Indenture may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the applicable series or multiple affected series. 
 It will not be necessary for the consent of the holders of the Notes of a series to approve the particular form of any proposed supplement, amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. 

Information Concerning the Trustee 
 If an Event of Default with respect to a series of the Notes has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise with respect to such series of Notes such of the rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person s own affairs. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request, order or direction of any holders of Notes of such series, unless such holders shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity, satisfactory to it in its sole discretion, against any loss, liability or expense which may be incurred thereby, and then only to the extent required by the terms of the Indenture. No provision of the Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties under the Indenture or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers. 
 The Trustee may resign with respect to the Notes by giving a written notice to the Issuers. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of a series may remove the Trustee with respect to the Notes of such series by notifying the Issuers and the Trustee in writing. The Issuers may remove the Trustee if 
 the Trustee has or acquires a conflicting interest, within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, and fails to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, or otherwise fails to comply with the eligibility requirements provided in the Indenture and fails to resign after written request therefor by the Issuers in accordance with the Indenture 
 the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any bankruptcy law 
 a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property or 
 the Trustee becomes incapable of acting. 
 If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee with respect to either series of the Notes for any reason, the Issuers shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee with respect to the Notes of such series. 
 A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee s acceptance of the appointment as provided in the Indenture. 
 The Trustee and its Affiliates have engaged, currently are engaged, and may in the future engage in financial or other transactions with the Issuers and our Affiliates in the ordinary course of their respective businesses. 
 Payment and Paying Agents 
 The Issuers will pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes at any office of ours or any agency designated by us. 
 The initial paying agent for the Euro Notes is Elavon Financial Services DAC. For so long as the Euro Notes are in global form, payment of principal and interest on, and any other amount due in respect of, the Euro Notes will be made by or to the order of the paying agent on behalf of the common depositary or its nominee as the registered holder thereof. After payment by the Issuers or the paying agent of interest, principal or other amounts in respect of the Euro Notes to the common depositary (or its nominee), the Issuers will not have responsibility or liability for such amounts to Euroclear or Clearstream, or to holders or beneficial owners of book-entry interests in the Euro Notes. The initial paying agent for the USD Notes is the Trustee. 
 In addition, the Issuers maintain a transfer agent and a security registrar for the Notes. The initial transfer agent and security registrar is the Trustee.

No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes. However, we may require holders to pay any transfer taxes or other similar governmental charges payable in connection with any such transfer or exchange. 
 The Issuers may change or appoint any paying agent, security registrar or transfer agent with respect to the Notes without prior notice to the holders of the Notes. The Issuers or any of their subsidiaries may act as paying agent, transfer agent or security registrar in respect of any Notes.

 With respect to any redemption of any Notes that requires the payment of any premium, the amount deposited pursuant to the above paragraph shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is so deposited with the Trustee or paying agent, as applicable, equal to such premium on such Notes calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit on the redemption date only required to be deposited with the Trustee or paying agent, as applicable, on or prior to the redemption date.
