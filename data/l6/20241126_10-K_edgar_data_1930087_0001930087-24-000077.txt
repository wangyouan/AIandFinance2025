TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Item 1. Business 
 
 GENERAL 
 
 We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We were formed on May 13, 2022 as a Delaware statutory trust and commenced operations on June 30, 2023. We make investments and generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in privately originated and privately negotiated investments, predominantly through direct lending to U.S. private companies in the middle market and upper middle-market in the form of one stop and other senior secured loans. GC Advisors structures these one stop loans as senior secured loans, and we obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral often takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company. In many cases, we are the sole lender or we, together with our affiliates, are the sole lenders of one stop loans, which can afford us additional influence over the borrower in terms of monitoring and, if necessary, remediating any underperformance. 
 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the term middle-market generally refers to companies having earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of less than 100.0 million annually. 
 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation. We also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated (a loan that ranks senior only to a borrower's equity securities and ranks junior to all of such borrower's other indebtedness in priority of payment) loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in U.S. middle-market companies. In addition, we may also invest in liquid credit instruments, including secured floating rate syndicated loans, securitized products and corporate bonds, and we expect that, as a general matter, our portfolio will initially be comprised of a greater percentage of such instruments than it will as our investment program matures, though the exact allocation could vary from time to time depending on market conditions and available investment opportunities. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to U.S. middle-market companies that had over 70.0 billion of capital under management as of October 1, 2024, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital. 
 
 We seek to invest at least 80 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) directly or indirectly in private credit investments (loans, bonds and other credit and related instruments that are issued in private offerings or issued by private companies). If we change our 80 test, we will provide shareholders with at least 60 days notice of such change. We expect to make investments that typically will have position sizes under 1 of our portfolio, on average. We expect to selectively invest more than 1 of capital in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base, particularly during the period prior to raising sufficient capital, which could result in larger individual investments when and if our capital base increases. We may invest in companies of any size or capitalization. 
 
 We primarily invest in U.S. middle market and upper middle market companies and, to the extent we invest in foreign companies, we intend to do so in accordance with the limits of the 1940 Act applicable to business development companies and only in jurisdictions with established legal frameworks and a history of respecting creditors rights as well as investment grade sovereign credit ratings, which generally includes countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development such as the United Kingdom, countries that are members of the European Union, as well as Canada, Australia and Japan, among others. Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other funds affiliated with Golub Capital. From time to time, we may co-invest with other funds affiliated with Golub Capital.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which could increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment. 
 
 We have financed, and may continue to finance, our investments with borrowed money. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on GC Advisors and our board of trustees assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. While we intend to target a leverage ratio of 0.85x to 1.25x debt-to-equity, this limitation will not prevent us from incurring additional leverage or otherwise exceeding such leverage ratio to the full extent permissible under the 1940 Act, including during periods when we are experiencing unusual market volatility or other unexpected conditions. We could issue senior debt securities to banks, insurance companies and other lenders, and/or issue unsecured debt or notes through one or more wholly-owned collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs. Under the terms of our Declaration of Trust, the board of trustees may authorize us to issue preferred shares in one or more classes or series without shareholder approval, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. 
 
 In addition, investment in leveraged companies involves a number of significant risks. Leveraged companies in which we invest could have limited financial resources and could be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold. 
 
 We have engaged, and, in the future, could again engage in hedging transactions to the limited extent such transactions are permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. We have and could, for example, use instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors and, if we were to invest in foreign securities, we could use instruments such as forward contracts or currency options in currencies selected to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. We could also, for example, borrow under a credit facility in currencies selected to minimize our foreign currency exposure. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful.

 About Golub Capital 
 
 Golub Capital, founded in 1994, is a leading lender to middle-market companies, with a long track record of investing in senior secured, one stop, second lien and subordinated loans. As of October 1, 2024, Golub Capital had over 70.0 billion of capital under management. Since its inception, Golub Capital has closed deals with over 390 middle-market sponsors and repeat transactions with over 270 sponsors. 
 
 Golub Capital s middle-market lending group is managed by an eight member senior management team consisting of Lawrence E. Golub, David B. Golub, Andrew H. Steuerman, Gregory W. Cashman, Spyro G. Alexopoulos, Marc C. Robinson, Robert G. Tuchscherer and Jason J. Van Dussen. As of September 30, 2024, Golub Capital had more than 220 investment professionals supported by more than 775 administrative and back office personnel that focus on operations, finance, legal and compliance, accounting and reporting, marketing, information technology and office management. 
 
 Market Trends 
 
 We pursue an investment strategy focused on investing primarily in newly originated first lien, senior secured, floating rate loans in U.S. middle-market companies in industries that we believe are resistant to recession. We find the middle market attractive for the following reasons: 
 
 Target Market. We believe that small and middle market companies in the United States with annual revenues between 10 million and 2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Golub Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us. We continue to focus our portfolio on borrowers in what we believe are recession resistant industries that are insulated from the effects of economic disruptions. 
 
 Specialized Lending Requirements . We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to 
 5 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 U.S. middle market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle market and (3) also requires more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender. 
 
 Demand for Debt Capital . We believe there is a large pool of committed but uninvested private equity capital for middle market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and subordinated debt from other sources, such as us. 
 
 Competition from Bank Lenders. We believe that many traditional bank lenders to middle market businesses have either exited or de-emphasized their service and product offerings in the middle market. These traditional lenders have instead focused on lending and providing other services to large corporate clients. We believe this has resulted in fewer key players and the reduced availability of debt capital to the companies we target. 
 
 Market Environment. We believe middle market investments are likely to excel in uncertain market environments and that these investments have historically generated premium yields with more desirable structures for lenders as compared to large corporate loans. (1) In addition, we believe the recent credit market dislocation will accelerate the market share shift toward well-positioned larger platforms. On the other hand, we believe that there has been increased competition for direct lending to middle market businesses, which would be expected to result in less favorable pricing terms for our potential investments. If we match our competitors pricing, terms and structure, we would expect to experience decreased net interest income, lower yields and increased risk of credit loss. However, we believe that Golub Capital s scale, product suite, entrenched relationships and strong market position will continue to allow us to find investment opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 
 (1) Standard Poor s High-End Middle-Market Lending Review 4Q 2023 New-issue first-lien yield-to-maturity. Middle-Market loans have, on average, generated higher yields in comparison to large corporate loans based on data starting in January 2000. 
 
 Competitive Strengths 
 
 Deep, Experienced Management Team. We are managed by GC Advisors, which as of September 30, 2024, has access through the Staffing Agreement to the resources and expertise of Golub Capital s more than 1,000 employees, led by Lawrence E. Golub and our president and chief executive officer, David B. Golub. As of September 30, 2024, Golub Capital s more than 220 investment professionals had an average of approximately 14 years of investment experience and were supported by more than 775 administrative and back office personnel that focus on operations, finance, legal and compliance, accounting and reporting, marketing, information technology and office management. GC Advisors also manages (i) Golub Capital BDC, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or GBDC; (ii) Golub Capital Direct Lending Corporation, a Maryland corporation, or GDLC; (iii) Golub Capital Direct Lending Unlevered Corporation, a Maryland corporation, or GDLCU; and (iv) Golub Capital BDC 4, Inc., a Maryland corporation, or GBDC 4; each of which has elected to be regulated as a business development company, have investment mandates similar to ours, and primarily focus on investing in one stop and other senior secured loans and in the case of GBDC, whose shares of common stock are publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Golub Capital seeks to hire and retain high-quality investment professionals and reward those personnel based on investor returns. 
 
 Leading U.S. Debt Platform Provides Access to Proprietary Relationship-Based Deal Flow . GC Advisors gives us access to the deal flow of Golub Capital, one of the leading middle-market lenders in the United States. Golub Capital has been a top 3 Traditional Middle-Market Bookrunner each year from 2008 through Q2 2024 for senior secured loans of up to 500.0 million for leveraged buyouts based on number of deals completed, according to Thomson Reuters LPC and internal data. We believe this market position makes Golub Capital the first choice lender to many sponsors. Since its inception, Golub Capital has closed deals with over 390 middle-market sponsors and repeat transactions with over 270 sponsors. We believe that Golub Capital receives relationship-based early looks and last looks at many investment opportunities in the U.S. middle-market market, allowing it to be highly selective in the transactions it pursues.

Using its disciplined approach to lending, GC Advisors seeks to minimize credit losses through effective underwriting, comprehensive due diligence investigations, structuring and the implementation of restrictive debt covenants. We expect that GC Advisors will continue to select borrowers whose businesses will retain significant value, even in a depressed market or a distressed sale. GC Advisors intends to reduce risk further by focusing on repeat transactions with proven, successful sponsors. While emphasizing thorough credit analysis, GC Advisors intends to maintain strong relationships with sponsors by offering rapid initial feedback from senior investment professionals on each investment opportunity. 
 
 Regimented Credit Monitoring. Following each investment, GC Advisors implements a regimented credit monitoring system. This careful approach, which involves ongoing review and analysis by teams of professionals, has enabled GC Advisors to identify problems early and to assist borrowers before they face difficult liquidity constraints. If necessary, GC Advisors can assume the role of deal sponsor in a work-out situation and has extensive restructuring experience, both in and out of bankruptcy. GC Advisors believes in the need to prepare for possible negative contingencies in order to address them promptly should they arise. 
 
 Concentrated Middle-Market Focus . Because of our focus on the middle-market, we understand the following general characteristics of middle-market lending: 
 
 middle-market companies are generally less leveraged than large companies and, we believe, offer more attractive investment returns in the form of upfront fees, prepayment penalties and higher interest rates; 
 middle-market issuers are more likely to have simple capital structures; 
 carefully structured covenant packages enable middle-market lenders to take early action to remediate poor financial performance; and 
 middle-market lenders can undertake thorough due diligence investigations prior to investment. 
 
 Investment Criteria/Guidelines 
 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in senior secured and one stop loans to U.S. middle-market companies in industries we believe are resistant to recessions. We seek to generate strong risk-adjusted net returns by assembling a portfolio of investments across a broad range of industries and private equity sponsors. 
 
 We primarily target U.S. middle-market companies controlled by private equity investors that require capital for growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations, refinancings and leveraged buyouts. We seek to have a portfolio of first-lien, senior secured loans to borrowers focused on a number of sectors and industries that we believe have shown resilience during economic disruptions and are likely to show resilience in future recessionary periods, including, for example, software and technology companies as well as business, financial and healthcare services among others. We also make opportunistic loans to independently owned and publicly held middle market companies. We seek to partner with strong management teams executing long-term growth strategies. Target businesses will typically exhibit some or all of the following characteristics: 
 
 annual EBITDA of less than 150.0 million; 
 sustainable leading positions in their respective markets; 
 scalable revenues and operating cash flow; 
 experienced management teams with successful track records; 
 insulation from the effects of economic disruptions; 
 stable, predictable cash flows with low technology and market risks; 
 a substantial equity cushion in the form of capital ranking junior to our investment provided by a middle market private equity sponsor;

 low capital expenditures requirements; 
 a North American base of operations; 
 strong customer relationships; 
 products, services or distribution channels having distinctive competitive advantages; 
 defensible niche strategy or other barriers to entry; and 
 demonstrated growth strategies. 
 While we believe that the criteria listed above are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company. 
 
 Investment Process Overview 
 
 We view our investment process as consisting of four distinct phases described below: 
 
 Origination. GC Advisors sources investment opportunities through access to a network of over 10,000 individual contacts developed in the financial services and related industries by Golub Capital and managed through a proprietary customer relationship database. Among these contacts is an extensive network of private equity firms and relationships with leading middle-market senior lenders. The senior deal professionals of Golub Capital supplement these leads through personal visits and marketing campaigns. It is their responsibility to identify specific opportunities, to refine opportunities through candid exploration of the underlying facts and circumstances and to apply creative and flexible thinking to solve clients financing needs. The investment professionals of Golub Capital have a long and successful track record investing in companies across many industry sectors. Collectively, these investment professionals have closed investments in over 2,600 loans at Golub Capital. Golub Capital s investments have been made in the following industries, among others: healthcare, restaurant and retail, software, digital and technology services, specialty manufacturing, business services, consumer products and services, food and beverages, aerospace and defense and value-added distribution. 
 
 Golub Capital has principal lending offices in North America, Europe and Asia. Each of Golub Capital s originators maintains long-standing customer relationships and is responsible for covering a specified target market. We believe those originators strength and breadth of relationships across a wide range of markets generate numerous financing opportunities, which we believe enables GC Advisors to be highly selective in recommending investments to us. 
 
 Underwriting. We utilize the systematic, consistent approach to underwriting developed by Golub Capital, with a particular focus on determining the value of a business in a downside scenario. The key criteria that we consider include (1) strong and resilient underlying business fundamentals, (2) a substantial equity cushion in the form of capital ranking junior in right of payment to our investment and (3) a conclusion that overall downside risk is manageable. While the size of this equity cushion will vary over time and across industries, the equity cushion generally sought by GC Advisors today is between 35 and 45 of total portfolio capitalization. We generally focus on the criteria developed by Golub Capital for evaluating prospective portfolio companies, which uses a combination of analyses, including (1) fundamental analysis of a business s financial statements, health, management, competitive advantages, competitors and markets; (2) analysis of opportunities in a given market based upon fluctuations due to seasonal, financial and economic factors; (3) quantitative analysis of the relative risk-return characteristics of investments and a comparison of yields between asset classes and other indicators; and (4) analysis of proprietary and secondary models. In evaluating a particular company, we put more emphasis on credit considerations (such as (1) loan-to-value ratio (which is the amount of our loan divided by the enterprise value of the company in which we are investing), (2) the ability of the company to maintain a liquidity cushion through economic cycles and in downside scenarios, (3) the ability of the company to service its fixed charge obligations under a variety of scenarios and (4) its anticipated strategic value in a downturn) than on profit potential and loan pricing. Based upon a combination of bottom-up analysis of the individual investment and GC Advisors expectations of future market conditions, GC Advisors seeks to assess the relative risk and reward for each investment. GC Advisors seeks to mitigate the risks of a single company or single industry through portfolio diversification. GC Advisors also considers environmental, social and governance considerations in the investment decision-making process, in accordance with its ESG policy, including analysis of the likelihood of material ESG-

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 related risk based on the industry and industry subsector of the potential portfolio company, with further diligence and analysis based on this categorization as well as other factors identified during diligence. ESG related risks can include, among others, issues related to environmental impact and climate change, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment, data privacy and security, social and labor conditions and ethics and compliance. Although GC Advisors typically avoids investing in portfolio companies in industries that tend to raise ESG related risks, GC Advisors would not necessarily pass on such investment opportunities solely for ESG reasons. Golub Capital s due diligence process for middle-market credits will typically entail: 
 
 a thorough review of historical and pro forma financial information; 
 on-site visits; 
 interviews with management and employees; 
 a review of loan documents and material contracts; 
 third-party quality of earnings accounting due diligence; 
 when appropriate, background checks on key managers and research relating to the company s business, industry, markets, customers, suppliers, products and services and competitors; and 
 the commission of third-party market studies when appropriate. 

The following chart illustrates the stages of Golub Capital s evaluation and underwriting process: 
 
 ILLUSTRATIVE DEAL EVALUATION PROCESS 

Execution. In executing transactions for us, GC Advisors utilizes the due diligence process developed by Golub Capital. Through a consistent approach to underwriting and careful attention to the details of execution, Golub Capital seeks to maintain discipline with respect to credit, pricing, and structure to ensure the ultimate success of the financing. Upon completion of due diligence, the investment team working on an investment delivers a final memorandum to GC Advisors investment committee. Once an investment has been approved by the investment committee, it moves through a series of steps generally, including initial documentation using standard document templates, final documentation, including resolution of business points and the execution of original documents held in escrow. Upon completion of final documentation, a loan is funded upon the execution of an investment committee memorandum by members of GC Advisors investment committee. 
 
 Monitoring. We view active portfolio monitoring as a vital part of our investment process. We consider board observation rights, where appropriate, regular dialogue with company management and sponsors and detailed, internally generated monitoring reports to be critical to our performance. Golub Capital has developed a monitoring template that is designed to reasonably ensure compliance with these standards. This template is used by GC

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Advisors as a tool to assess investment performance relative to our plan. In addition, our portfolio companies often rely on GC Advisors to provide them with financial and capital markets expertise. 
 
 As part of the monitoring process, GC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. This system is not generally accepted in our industry or used by our competitors. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as GC Advisors internal performance ratings: 
 
 Internal Performance Ratings Rating Definition 5 Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 4 Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. 3 Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination. The borrower could be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due. 2 Involves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments could be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). 1 Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 1 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. 
 
 Our internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. 
 
 For any investment rated 1, 2 or 3, GC Advisors increases its monitoring intensity and prepares regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. 
 
 GC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the internal performance ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, GC Advisors and our board of trustees review these internal performance ratings on a quarterly basis. 
 
 The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 internal performance rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and 2023:

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Investment Committee 
 
 GC Advisors investment committee, which is comprised of officers of GC Advisors, evaluates and approves all of our investments, subject to the oversight of our board of trustees. The investment committee process is intended to bring the diverse experience and perspectives of the committee s members to the analysis and consideration of each investment. The investment committee currently consists of Lawrence E. Golub, David B. Golub, Andrew H. Steuerman, Gregory W. Cashman, Spyro G. Alexopoulos, Marc C. Robinson, Robert G. Tuchscherer and Jason J. Van Dussen. The investment committee serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to our core investment philosophy and policies. The investment committee also determines appropriate investment sizing and suggests ongoing monitoring requirements. Investment teams and investment committees responsible for an area of investment may include investment professionals and senior management from among one or more of GC Advisors and its affiliates. 
 
 In addition to reviewing investments, investment committee meetings serve as a forum to discuss credit views and outlooks. Potential transactions and deal flow are reviewed on a regular basis. Members of the investment team are encouraged to share information and credit views with the investment committee early in their analysis. We believe this process improves the quality of the analysis and assists the deal team members to work more efficiently. 
 
 Each transaction is presented to the investment committee in a formal written report. Each investment opportunity generally receives the unanimous approval of the investment committee. Each member of the investment committee performs a similar role for other investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles, collectively referred to as accounts, sponsored or managed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. 
 
 Broadly Syndicated Loans Investment Team 
 
 GC Advisors broadly syndicated loans investment team BSL Team is generally responsible for managing our broadly syndicated loans where Golub Capital does not act as lead arranger, joint lead arranger or co-manager BSLs ). Our BSL investments may be comprised of debt obligations with various public credit ratings, although we expect such investments primarily to be comprised of obligations below investment grade quality. 
 
 Investment Structure 
 
 Once GC Advisors determines that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, GC Advisors typically works with the private equity sponsor, if applicable, the management of that company and its other capital providers to structure our investment. GC Advisors negotiates with these parties to agree on how our investment should be structured relative to other capital in the portfolio company s capital structure. 
 
 GC Advisors structures our investments, which typically have maturities of three to seven years, as follows: 
 
 Senior Secured Loans . GC Advisors structures these investments as senior secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of our senior secured loans. This collateral often takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company. Our senior secured loans often provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. Our senior secured loans may include a payment in kind PIK feature. 
 
 One Stop Loans. GC Advisors structures our one stop loans as senior secured loans. A one stop loan is a single loan that blends the characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured debt and traditional junior debt. The structure generally combines the stronger lender protections associated with senior debt with the superior economics of junior capital. We obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral often takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company. In some cases, one stop loans are provided to borrowers experiencing high revenue growth supported by a high level of discretionary expenditures. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such 
 11 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 discretionary expenses, if appropriate. One stop loans typically provide for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the facility, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. Our one stop loans may include a PIK feature. One stop loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. In many cases, we are the sole lender or we, together with our affiliates, are the sole lenders of a one stop loan, which can afford us additional influence over the borrower in terms of monitoring and, if necessary, remediating any underperformance. 
 
 One stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as recurring revenue loans. Other targeted characteristics of recurring revenue businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower s high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. 
 
 Second Lien Loans. GC Advisors structures these investments as subordinated, secured loans for which our claims on the related collateral are subordinated. We obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral typically takes the form of second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. Second lien loans typically provide for minimal loan amortization in the initial years of the facility, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. 
 
 Subordinated Loans. GC Advisors structures these investments as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates and provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically require interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and PIK interest) in the early years, with all or the majority of amortization of principal deferred until loan maturity. Subordinated loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. 
 
 Second lien loans and subordinated loans are generally more volatile than first lien, senior secured loans and involve a greater risk of loss of principal. In addition, the PIK feature of many subordinated loans, which effectively operates as negative amortization of loan principal, increases credit risk exposure over the life of the loan. Subordinated loans are more likely to include a PIK feature. 
 
 Equity Investments. GC Advisors structures these investments as direct or indirect minority equity co-investments in a portfolio company, usually on terms similar to the controlling private equity sponsor and in connection with our loan to such portfolio company. As a result, if a portfolio company appreciates in value, we can achieve additional investment return from these equity co-investments. GC Advisors can structure these equity co-investments to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, which could include a put, or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events or demand and piggyback registration rights. However, because these equity co-investments will typically be in private companies, there is no guarantee that we, as a minority-interest holder, will control the timing or value of our realization of any gains on such investments. Our equity co-investments will typically include customary tag-along and/or drag-along rights that will permit or require us to participate in a sale of such equity co-investments at such time as the majority owners, not GC Advisors, determine. 
 
 GC Advisors tailors the terms of each investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its operating results. GC Advisors seeks to limit the downside potential of our investments by: 
 
 selecting investments that we believe have a very low probability of loss; 
 requiring a total return on our investments that we believe will compensate us appropriately for credit risk; and 
 12 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with the preservation of our capital. Such restrictions could include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights. 
 We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell some of our investments earlier if a liquidity event occurs, such as a sale, recapitalization or worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company. 
 
 Investments 
 
 We invest primarily in first lien, senior secured loans in middle-market companies in industries that we believe are recession resistant. In addition, we seek to have a portfolio of first-lien, senior secured loans to borrowers believed to be insulated from the effects of economic disruptions. Under normal conditions, we expect to make investments that typically will have position sizes under 1 of our portfolio, on average. We expect to selectively invest more than 1 of capital in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base, particularly during the period prior to raising sufficient capital, which could result in larger individual investments when and if our capital base increases. We may invest in companies of any size or capitalization. Set forth below is a list of our ten largest portfolio company investments as of September 30, 2024, as well as the top ten industries in which we were invested as of September 30, 2024, calculated as a percentage of our total investments at fair value as of such date.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Managerial Assistance 
 As a business development company, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. The Administrator or an affiliate of the Administrator provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We could receive fees for these services and reimburse the Administrator or an affiliate of the Administrator, as applicable, for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review and approval by our board of trustees, including our independent trustees. 
 Temporary Investments 
 Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments could consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70 of our assets are qualifying assets or temporary investments. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that could be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25 of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would generally not meet the diversification tests described in Section 851(b)(3) of the Code in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. GC Advisors will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
 Competition 
 Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company or to the source-of-income, asset diversification and distribution requirements we must satisfy to maintain our treatment as a RIC. 
 We use the expertise of the investment professionals of Golub Capital and its affiliates to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, the relationships of the senior members of Golub Capital and its affiliates enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we invest. See " Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Business and Structure - We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses ." 
 
 Administration 
 We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by GC Advisors. Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our board of trustees. We have a chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, chief compliance officer, managing directors and an associate director, and to the extent necessary, our board of trustees can elect to appoint additional officers going forward. Our officers are officers and/or employees of Golub Capital LLC, an affiliate of GC Advisors, and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs is paid by us pursuant to the administration agreement, or the Administration Agreement, with the Administrator. See Management Agreements Administration Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 SUMMARY RISK FACTORS 
 
 The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC. 
 
 We are subject to risks relating to our business and structure 
 
 We are a relatively new company with a limited operating history. 
 We are subject to risks associated with the current interest rate environment and to the extent we use debt to finance our investments, changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital and net investment income. 
 We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses. 
 We are dependent upon GC Advisors for our success and upon its access to the investment professionals and partners of Golub Capital and its affiliates. 
 Our business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships with sponsors and investing in companies backed by private equity sponsors. Any inability of GC Advisors to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business. 
 There are significant potential conflicts of interest as a result of our arrangements with GC Advisors and its affiliates and GC Advisors investment committee that could affect our investment returns. 
 GC Advisors could make certain investment decisions for the purpose of receiving transaction fees. 
 Reductions, waivers or absorptions of fees and costs can temporarily result in higher returns to investors than they would otherwise receive if full fees and costs were charged. 
 GC Advisors could prioritize its relationship with a borrower or private equity sponsor instead of seeking the most advantageous terms for our investments. 
 GC Advisors operates in multiple business lines and could pursue additional business lines, which could create a conflict of interest in the allocation of its time and focus. 
 Golub Capital could pursue strategic transactions, which could create a conflict of interest in the allocation of GC Advisors time and focus. 
 We and GC Advisors could be the target of litigation or regulatory investigations. 
 We are subject to certain risks related to our ability to qualify as a RIC and to related regulations governing our operation as a business development company. 
 We finance our investments with borrowed money, which will accelerate and increase the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and could increase the risk of investing in us. 
 We could default under our credit facilities. 
 The majority of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our valuation designee and, as a result, there could be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments. 
 Our board of trustees could change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or shareholder approval. 
 GC Advisors can resign on 120 days notice, and we can provide no assurance that we would be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 The Administrator can resign on 60 days notice, and we can provide no assurance that we would be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to risks relating to our investments 
 
 Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and defaults by our portfolio companies will harm our operating results. 
 Inflation could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies. 
 Our investments in debt, leveraged portfolio companies, and private and middle-market portfolio companies are risky and we could lose all or part of our investment. 
 15 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 The lack of liquidity in our investments could adversely affect our business. 
 Price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets could adversely affect the fair value of our portfolio investments, reducing our net asset value, or NAV through increased net unrealized depreciation. 
 Our portfolio companies could prepay loans, which could reduce our yields if capital returned cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater expected yields. 
 We are subject to credit and default risk and our portfolio companies could be unable to repay or refinance outstanding principal on their loans at or prior to maturity. 
 Our portfolio could be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies and industries, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments or if there is a downturn in a particular industry. 
 We could hold the debt securities of leveraged companies that could, due to the significant volatility of such companies, enter into bankruptcy proceedings. 
 Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio. 
 Because we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we generally will not be able to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments. 
 Our portfolio companies could incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies and such portfolio companies could fail to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations to us. 
 The disposition of our investments could result in contingent liabilities. 
 GC Advisors liability is limited, and we have agreed to indemnify GC Advisors against certain liabilities, which could lead GC Advisors to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. 
 We could be subject to risks if we engage in hedging transactions and could become subject to risks if we invest in foreign securities. 
 We could suffer losses from our equity investments. 
 We could be subject to lender liability claims with respect to our portfolio company investments. 
 
 Investors are subject to risks relating to an investment in our securities 
 
 Investing in our securities could involve an above average degree of risk. 
 There is a risk that investors in our equity securities will not receive distributions or that our distributions will not grow over time and a portion of our distributions could be a return of capital. 
 We have not established any limit on the amount of funds we can use from available sources, such as borrowings, if any, or proceeds from offerings of our Common Shares, to fund distributions. 
 The Unsecured Notes are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. 
 If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Unsecured Notes.

 MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS 
 GC Advisors is located at 200 Park Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10166. GC Advisors is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. GC Advisors is controlled by Lawrence E. Golub and David B. Golub and the beneficial interests in GC Advisors are majority owned, indirectly, by two affiliated trusts for the benefit of Lawrence E. Golub and David B. Golub and their respective families. The trustees of those trusts are Stephen A. Kepniss and David L. Finegold. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of trustees and in accordance with the 1940 Act, GC Advisors manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, GC Advisors: 
 determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; 
 identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies); 
 executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make; 
 determines the securities and other assets that we purchase, retain or sell; and 
 provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds. 
 GC Advisors services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive. Subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, GC Advisors can enter into one or more sub-advisory agreements under which GC Advisors would obtain assistance in fulfilling its responsibilities under the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay GC Advisors a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components a base management fee, or the Base Management Fee, and an incentive fee, or the Incentive Fee. The cost of both the Base Management Fee and the Incentive Fee is ultimately borne by our shareholders. 
 
 Management Fee 
 
 The Base Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of the value of our net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable quarter adjusted for share issuances and repurchases. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, net assets means our total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. For the first calendar quarter in which we had operations, net assets was measured as the beginning total assets less liabilities as of the date on which we broke escrow. 
 
 Incentive Fee 
 
 The Incentive Fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component could be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of our income (the Income Incentive Fee and a portion is based on a percentage of our capital gains (the Capital Gain Incentive Fee ).

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Income Incentive Fee 
 
 The Income Incentive Fee is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter, as adjusted for share issuances and repurchases, from interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement entered into between us and the Administrator, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee and any shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees). 
 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The impact of expense support payments and recoupments are also excluded from Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of 1.25 per quarter (5.0 annualized). 
 
 We calculate the Income Incentive Fee quarterly in arrears with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 
 zero in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns does not exceed the hurdle rate; 
 100 of that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). We refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 1.43 as the catch-up . The catch-up is meant to provide GC Advisors with approximately 12.5 of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 1.43 in any calendar quarter; and 
 12.5 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 12.5 of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to GC Advisors. 
 
 The sum of these calculations yields the Income Incentive Fee. This amount is appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter. 
 
 Capital Gain Incentive Fee 
 
 The Capital Gain Incentive Fee component is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable equals: 
 
 12.5 of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. We will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to GC Advisors if we were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Advisers Act, including Section 205 thereof.

 Payment of Our Expenses 
 
 All investment professionals of GC Advisors and/or its affiliates, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of personnel allocable to these services to us, are provided and paid for by GC Advisors and not by us. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions. See "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Expenses. 
 
 Duration and Termination 
 
 Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect for an initial two year term and thereafter shall continue in effect from year to year if approved annually by our board of trustees or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of our trustees who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, of us or GC Advisors. The Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by GC Advisors and can be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days written notice to the other. The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, by vote, can also terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure We are dependent upon GC Advisors for our success and upon its access to the investment professionals and partners of Golub Capital and its affiliates. 
 
 Indemnification 
 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, GC Advisors and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of GC Advisors services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. 
 
 Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement 
 
 At a meeting of our board of trustees held in May 2024, our board of trustees voted unanimously to re-approve the Investment Advisory Agreement. In reaching a decision to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, our board of trustees reviewed a significant amount of information and considered, among other things: 
 
 the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by GC Advisors; 
 the investment advisory fee rates to be paid by us to GC Advisors; 
 the fee structures of comparable externally managed business development companies that engage in similar investing activities; 
 our projected operating expenses and expense ratio comparisons of business development companies with similar investment objectives; 
 information about the services performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Advisory Agreement; and 
 the organizational capability and financial condition of GC Advisors and its affiliates. 
 
 Based on the information reviewed and the considerations detailed above, our board of trustees, including all of the trustees who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, of us or GC Advisors, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided.

In addition, if requested to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, the Administrator is paid an additional amount based on the cost of the services provided, which shall not exceed the amount we receive from such portfolio companies for providing this assistance. At a meeting of our board of trustees held in May 2024, our board of trustees voted unanimously to re-approve the Administration Agreement for a one-year period. The Administration Agreement can be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other party.

 Managing Dealer Agreement 
 
 We have entered into a managing dealer agreement (the Managing Dealer Agreement with Arete Wealth Management, LLC (the Managing Dealer ).

 Distribution and Servicing Plan 
 
 On April 4, 2023, our board of trustees approved a distribution and servicing plan (the Distribution and Servicing Plan and on May 3, 2024 the Distribution and Servicing Plan was amended and approved for an additional one-year period. The following table shows the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees we pay the Managing Dealer with respect to the Class S Shares, Class D Shares and Class I Shares on an annualized basis as a percentage of our NAV for such class. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are paid monthly in arrears, calculated using the NAV of the applicable class as of the beginning of the first calendar day of each applicable quarter. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are calculated and paid separately for each class. 
 Shareholder Servicing and/or Distribution Fee as a of NAV Class S Shares 0.85 Class D Shares 0.25 Class I Shares N/A 
 
 The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees paid under the Distribution and Servicing Plan are used primarily to compensate the Managing Dealer for such services provided in connection with the offering and sale of our shares, and/or to reimburse the Managing Dealer for related expenses incurred, including payments by the Managing Dealer to compensate or reimburse brokers, other financial institutions or other industry professionals, for distribution services and sales support services provided and related expenses. 
 
 Payments of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee are also used to compensate the Managing Dealer for personal services and/or the maintenance of shareholder accounts services provided to shareholders in the related share class and could be made without regard to expenses actually incurred. 
 
 Payments of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees on behalf of a particular share class must be in consideration of services rendered for or on behalf of such class. In addition to the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, we also pay the Managing Dealer certain additional fees for its services under the Distribution and Servicing Plan, which are borne indirectly by our shareholders. Any fees paid pursuant to the Distribution and Servicing Plan may not exceed the maximum amounts, if any, as may from time to time be permitted by FINRA rules. 
 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 
 We have entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement with GC Advisors. Pursuant to the agreement, GC Advisors may elect to pay certain expenses on our behalf (each, an Expense Support Payment ), provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any of our interest expense or distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees. Any Expense Support Payment that GC Advisors has committed to pay must be paid to us by GC Advisors in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from us to GC Advisors or its affiliates. 
 
 Following any calendar month in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to our shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in 
 21 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 such calendar month (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds ), we shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to GC Advisors until such time as all Expense Support Payments made by GC Advisors to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar month have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by us shall be referred to herein as a Reimbursement Payment . Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) our net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP, (ii) net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). 
 
 No Reimbursement Payment for any month will be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share (as defined below) declared by us at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, or (2) our Operating Expense Ratio (as defined below) at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 365 day year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to distribution and shareholder fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing operating expenses, less organizational and offering expenses, base management and incentive fees owed to Adviser, and interest expense, by our net assets. 
 
 Our obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment shall automatically become our liability on the last business day of the applicable calendar month, except to the extent GC Advisors has waived its right to receive such payment for the applicable month. 
 
 Public Offering Escrow Agreement 
 
 We entered into an escrow agreement (the Public Offering Escrow Agreement with UMB Bank, N.A.. We will accept purchase orders and hold investors funds in an interest-bearing escrow account until we receive purchase orders for at least 100 investors in such class (the Minimum Shareholder Amount and our board of trustees has authorized the release of the funds in the escrow account. If, as of the close of business on the one year anniversary of the commencement of the offering, we have not satisfied the Minimum Shareholder Amount, the escrow agent will promptly send investors a full refund of their investment with interest and without deduction for escrow expenses. If we break escrow for its offering, interest earned on funds in escrow will be released to our account and constitute part of our net assets. 
 
 License Agreement 
 
 We have entered into a license agreement with Golub Capital LLC under which Golub Capital LLC has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Golub Capital . Under this agreement, we will have a right to use the Golub Capital name for so long as GC Advisors or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser.

REGULATION 
 
 General 
 
 We are a business development company under the 1940 Act and have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the trustees of a business development company be persons other than interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we cannot change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a business development company without the approval of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 
 We can invest up to 100 of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we could, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an underwriter, as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we could enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate or foreign currency fluctuations. However, we could purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. 
 
 Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we could acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company in excess of the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments could subject our shareholders to additional expenses. None of these policies, or any of our other policies, is fundamental and each could be changed without shareholder approval. To the extent we adopt any fundamental policies, no person from whom we borrow will have, in such person s capacity as lender or debt holder, either a veto power or a vote in approving or changing any of our fundamental policies. 
 
 Qualifying Assets 
 
 Under the 1940 Act, a business development company is restricted from acquiring any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70 of the company s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 
 
 (1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from 
 23 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 any other person, subject to such rules as could be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer that: 
 a. is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
 b. is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company, or SBIC, wholly-owned by the business development company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 
 c. satisfies either of the following: 
 i. does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a 250.0 million market capitalization maximum; or 
 ii. is controlled by a business development company or a group of companies including a business development company, the business development company actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result, the business development company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company. 
 (2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control. 
 (3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident to such a private transaction, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 
 (4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60 of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 
 (5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 
 (6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities that mature in one year or less from the date of investment. 
 The regulations defining and interpreting qualifying assets can change over time. We could adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. 
 
 We look through our consolidated subsidiaries to the underlying holdings (considered together with portfolio assets held outside of our consolidated subsidiaries) for purposes of determining compliance with the 70 qualifying assets requirement of the 1940 Act. At least 70 of our assets will be eligible assets. 
 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 
 A business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70 test, the business development company must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance. However, when the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group could make available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the business development company, through its trustees, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. The Administrator, or an affiliate of the Administrator, provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Senior Securities 
 
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our common shares if our asset coverage, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200 (or 150 upon receipt of certain approvals and subject to the requirement that we make an offer to repurchase the shares of our shareholders) immediately after each such issuance (or such other percentage as could be prescribed by law from time to time). Prior to the enactment of the Small Business Credit Availability Act, or SBCAA, in March 2018, the asset coverage requirement applicable to business development companies was 200 . The SBCAA permits a business development company to be subject to an asset coverage requirement of 150 so long as it meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirement permits a business development company to have a ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200 asset coverage requirement. In other words, under the 1940 Act, we are able to borrow 2 for investment purposes for every 1 of investor equity, as opposed to borrowing 1 for investment purposes for every 1 of investor equity. On May 17, 2023, our sole shareholder approved the adoption of this 150 threshold pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and such election became effective the following day. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 208.3 . 
 
 In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we will be required to make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. We will also be permitted to borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes, which borrowings would not be considered senior securities. 
 
 We consolidate our financial results with all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including GCRED Holdings, the 2023 Issuer, formerly the CLO Vehicle, and the 2023 CLO Depositor for financial reporting purposes and measure our compliance with the leverage test applicable to business development companies under the 1940 Act on a consolidated basis. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Risk Factors Risks Relating to our Business and Structure Regulations governing our operation as a business development company affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. As a business development company, the necessity of raising additional capital exposes us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage . 
 
 Codes of Ethics 
 
 We and GC Advisors have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code can invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that could be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code s requirements. Each code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to GC Advisors. The proxy voting policies and procedures of GC Advisors are set out below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by GC Advisors and our trustees who are not interested persons and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
 
 Introduction 
 
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, GC Advisors has a fiduciary duty to act solely in our best interests. As part of this duty, GC Advisors recognizes that it must vote our securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests. 
 
 GC Advisors policies and procedures for voting proxies for its investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

25 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Proxy Policies 
 
 GC Advisors votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our shareholders. GC Advisors reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a shareholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities we hold. In most cases GC Advisors will vote in favor of proposals that GC Advisors believes are likely to increase the value of the portfolio securities we hold. Although GC Advisors will generally vote against proposals that could have a negative effect on our portfolio securities, GC Advisors could vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 
 Our proxy voting decisions are made by GC Advisors chief executive officer and president. To ensure that GC Advisors vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, GC Advisors requires that (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to its chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how GC Advisors intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest could be present, GC Advisors will disclose such conflicts to us, including our independent trustees, and could request guidance from us on how to vote such proxies. 
 
 Proxy Voting Records 
 
 You can obtain information without charge about how GC Advisors voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Golub Capital Private Credit Fund, Attention: Investor Relations, 200 Park Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10166, or by calling us to collect at (212) 750-6060. 
 
 Privacy Principles 
 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our shareholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. 
 
 We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our shareholders to employees of GC Advisors and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We will maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our shareholders. 
 
 Other 
 
 Under the 1940 Act, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a business development company, we are prohibited from protecting any trustee or officer against any liability to us or our shareholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person s office. 
 
 We and GC Advisors are required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering these policies and procedures. 
 
 We could also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of trustees who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the business development company prohibition on transactions with affiliates to prohibit joint transactions among entities that share a common investment adviser. The staff of the SEC has granted no-action relief permitting purchases of a single class of privately placed securities provided that the adviser negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met. Any co-investment would be made subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. If opportunities arise that would otherwise be appropriate for us and for another account sponsored or managed by GC Advisors to make different investments in the same issuer, GC Advisors will need to decide which account will

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 proceed with the investment. Moreover, in certain circumstances, we could be unable to invest in an issuer in which another account sponsored or managed by GC Advisors has previously invested. 
 
 On February 27, 2017, GC Advisors and certain other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates, received exemptive relief from the SEC that permits us greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments if our board of trustees determines that it would be advantageous for us to co-invest with other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. We believe that co-investment by us and accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates could afford us additional investment opportunities and the ability to achieve greater diversification. Under the terms of this exemptive relief, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent trustees is required to make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment strategies and policies. On January 13, 2023, the SEC issued an order amending the existing co-investment exemptive relief order to incorporate the terms of the temporary, conditional exemptive relief announced by the SEC on April 8, 2020 in order to permit those entities permitted to rely on the order to participate in certain follow-on co-investment transactions. 
 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes a variety of regulatory requirements on companies with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 
 
 our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
 pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 
 our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and 
 pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls during the fiscal quarter covered by such report, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 
 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated under such act. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we comply with that act. 
 
 Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 
 
 The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in our Common Shares. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to such an investment. For example, we have not described certain considerations that could be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including shareholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect to mark-to-market their securities holdings, pension plans and trusts, persons that have a functional currency (as defined in Section 985 of the Code) other than the U.S. dollar and financial institutions. This summary assumes that investors hold our Common Shares as capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, 
 27 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 regarding any offering of our securities. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets. For purposes of this discussion, references to dividends are to dividends within the meaning of the U.S. federal income tax laws and associated regulations and can include amounts subject to treatment as a return of capital under section 19(a) of the 1940 Act. 
 A U.S. shareholder is a beneficial owner of our Common Shares that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: 
 
 a citizen or individual resident of the United States; 
 
 a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 
 
 an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 
 
 a trust if either a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or the trust was in existence on August 20, 1996, was treated as a U.S. person prior to that date, and has made a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person. 
 
 A Non-U.S. shareholder is a beneficial owner of our Common Shares that is not a U.S. shareholder. 
 
 If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our Common Shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A prospective investor that is a partner in a partnership that will hold our Common Shares should consult its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our Common Shares. 
 
 Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our Common Shares will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty, and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws. 
 
 Election to Be Taxed as a RIC 
 
 As a business development company, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our shareholders as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our shareholders. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of our investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, or the Annual Distribution Requirement. Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must timely distribute to our shareholders in respect of each calendar year dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of the excess (if any) of our realized capital gains over our realized capital losses, or capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary losses, generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gains net income for preceding years that were recognized but not distributed during such years and on which we incurred no federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. 

28 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Taxation as a RIC 
 
 If we: 
 qualify as a RIC; and 
 satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement; 
 then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which is defined as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses, we timely distribute as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our shareholders. As a RIC, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any net income or net capital gain not distributed as dividends to our shareholders. 
 In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 
 
 qualify and have in effect an election to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 
 derive in each taxable year at least 90 of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships (partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90 of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income), or the 90 Income Test; and 
 diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 
 at least 50 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5 of the value of our assets or more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 
 no more than 25 of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships, or the Diversification Tests. 
 We can invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which could result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income, franchise or other tax liabilities. 
 
 In addition, as a RIC, we are subject to ordinary income and capital gain distribution requirements under U.S. federal excise tax rules for each calendar year. If we do not meet the required distributions, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on the undistributed amount. The failure to meet U.S. federal excise tax distribution requirements will not cause us to lose our RIC status, and we could choose to retain taxable income or capital gains in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year in an amount less than what would trigger payments of federal income tax under Subchapter M of the Code. We could then be required to pay a 4 excise tax on such income or capital gains. 
 
 A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its investment company taxable income. If our deductible expenses in a given taxable year exceed our investment company taxable income, we could incur a net operating loss for that taxable year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent taxable years and such net operating losses do not pass through to its shareholders. In addition, deductible expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. A RIC cannot use any net capital losses (that is, the excess of realized capital losses over realized capital gains) to offset its investment company taxable income, but could carry forward such net capital losses, and use them to offset future capital gains, indefinitely. Due to these limits on deductibility of expenses and net capital losses, we could for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several taxable years that we are required to distribute and that is 
 29 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 taxable to our shareholders even if such taxable income is greater than the net income we actually earn during those taxable years. 
 
 Any underwriting fees paid by us are not deductible in computing our investment company taxable income. We could be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold a debt instrument that is treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each taxable year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the taxable year of accrual, we could be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. Furthermore, a portfolio company in which we hold equity or debt instruments could face financial difficulty that requires us to work out, modify, or otherwise restructure such equity or debt instruments. Any such restructuring could, depending upon the terms of the restructuring, cause us to incur unusable or nondeductible losses or recognize future non-cash taxable income. 
 
 Certain of our investment practices could be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that could, among other things, (1) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (2) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction as ineligible for such treatment, (3) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (4) convert lower-taxed long-term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (5) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (6) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (7) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (8) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (9) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90 Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and could make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions and to preserve our qualification as a RIC. There can be no assurance that we will be eligible for any such tax elections or that any adverse effects of these provisions will be mitigated. 
 
 Certain distributions reported by us as Section 163(j) interest dividends may be treated as interest income by shareholders for purposes of the tax rules applicable to interest expense limitations under Section 163(j) of the Code. Such treatment by the shareholder is generally subject to holding period requirements and other potential limitations, although the holding period requirements are generally not applicable to dividends declared by money market funds and certain other funds that declare dividends daily and pay such dividends on a monthly or more frequent basis. The amount that we are eligible to report as a Section 163(j) dividend for a tax year is generally limited to the excess of our business interest income over the sum of our (i) business interest expense and (ii) other deductions properly allocable to our business interest income. 
 
 We can invest a portion of our net assets in below investment grade instruments. Investments in these types of instruments can present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when we can cease to accrue interest, original issue discount or market discount, when and to what extent deductions can be taken for bad debts or worthless instruments, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income and whether exchanges of debt obligations in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. We intend to address these and other issues to the extent necessary in order to seek to ensure that we distribute sufficient income to avoid any material amount of either U.S. federal income tax or the 4 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax. 
 
 Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 
 
 Our investment in non-U.S. securities could be subject to non-U.S. income, withholding and other taxes. In that case, our yield on those securities would be decreased. U.S. shareholders generally will not be entitled to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit or deduction with respect to non-U.S. taxes paid by us.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 If we acquire shares in a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any excess distribution received on, or any gain from the disposition of, such shares even if we distribute such income as a taxable dividend to shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest generally will be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from any such excess distribution or gain. If we invest in the shares of a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a qualified electing fund under the Code, or QEF, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year our proportionate share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed by the QEF. Alternatively, we could elect to mark our shares in a PFIC at the end of each taxable year to market; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent that any such decrease does not exceed prior increases in such value included in our income. Our ability to make either election will depend on factors beyond our control, and is subject to restrictions which could limit the availability of the benefit of these elections. Under either election, we could be required to recognize in a taxable year income in excess of any distributions we receive from PFICs and any proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that taxable year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of determining whether we satisfy the distribution requirements under U.S. federal excise tax rules. 
 
 Under Section 988 of the Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time we accrue income, expenses or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such income or pay such expenses or liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, gains or losses on foreign currency-denominated forward, futures and option contracts, as well as certain other financial instruments, and the disposition of debt obligations denominated in a foreign currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss. 
 
 Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our shareholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage tests are met. See Business Regulation Senior Securities . Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements could be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we could make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
 
 Some of the income and fees that we recognize , such as fees for providing managerial assistance, certain fees earned with respect to our investments, income recognized in a work-out or restructuring of a portfolio investment, or income recognized from an equity investment in an operating partnership, will not satisfy the 90 Income Test. In order to ensure that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90 Income Test, we could be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to incur a liability for U.S. corporate income tax as well as state and local tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees. 
 
 Failure to Qualify as a RIC 
 
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and are unable to cure the failure, for example, by disposing of certain investments quickly or raising additional capital to prevent the loss of RIC status, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Code provides certain relief from RIC disqualification due to inadvertent failures to comply with the 90 Income Test and the Diversification Tests, although there could be additional taxes due in such cases. We cannot assure you that we would qualify for any such relief should we fail the 90 Income Test or the Diversification Tests. 
 
 Should failure occur, not only would all our taxable income be subject to tax at regular corporate rates, we would not be able to deduct dividend distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income, nor would such distributions be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our shareholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated 
 31 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, certain corporate shareholders would be eligible to claim dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends and non-corporate shareholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as qualified dividend income, which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two consecutive taxable years, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we could be subject to regular corporate income tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e . , the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five taxable years. 
 
 The remainder of this discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement. 
 
 Taxation of U.S. Shareholders 
 
 Distributions by us generally are taxable to U.S. shareholders and generally will be characterized as either ordinary income or capital gains. Distributions of our investment company taxable income (which is, generally, our net ordinary income plus net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid) will be taxable as ordinary income to U.S. shareholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional Common Shares. To the extent such distributions paid by us to non-corporate shareholders (including individuals) are attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations and if certain holding period requirements are met, such distributions generally will be treated as qualified dividend income and generally will be eligible for a maximum U.S. federal tax rate of either 15 or 20 , depending on whether the individual shareholder s income exceeds certain threshold amounts, and if other applicable requirements are met, such distributions generally will be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction to the extent such dividends have been paid by a U.S. corporation. In this regard, it is anticipated that distributions paid by us will generally not be attributable to dividends and, therefore, generally will not qualify for the preferential maximum U.S. federal tax rate applicable to non-corporate shareholders as well as will not be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction. 
 
 Distributions of our net capital gains (which is generally our realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) properly designated by us as capital gain dividends to a U.S. shareholder generally will be characterized as long-term capital gains. Capital gain dividends distributed to U.S. shareholders, other than corporations, are generally subject to a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of either 15 or 20 , depending on whether the individual shareholder s income exceeds certain threshold amounts, regardless of the U.S. shareholder s holding period for the shareholder s Common Shares and regardless of whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional Common Shares. Capital gain dividends distributed to U.S. shareholders classified as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates applicable to ordinary income. Distributions in excess of our earnings and profits first will reduce a U.S. shareholder s adjusted tax basis in such shareholder s Common Shares and, after the adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will constitute capital gains to such U.S. shareholder. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in newly issued Common Shares will be treated as receiving a distribution equal to the value of the shares received, and should have a cost 
 basis of such amount. 
 
 Although we currently intend to distribute any net capital gains at least annually, we can in the future decide to retain some or all of our net capital gains but designate the retained amount as a deemed distribution. In that case, among other consequences, we will be subject to tax on the retained amount, each U.S. shareholder will be required to include their share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been distributed to the U.S. shareholder, and the U.S. shareholder will be entitled to claim a credit equal to their allocable share of the tax incurred by us on the deemed distribution by us. The amount of the deemed distribution net of such tax will be added to the U.S. shareholder s tax basis for their Common Shares. Since we expect to pay tax on any retained net capital gains at our regular corporate tax rate, and since that rate is in excess of the maximum rate currently payable by individuals on 
 32 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 long-term capital gains, the amount of tax that individual shareholders will be treated as having paid and for which they will receive a credit will exceed the tax they owe on the retained net capital gain. Such excess generally could be claimed as a credit against the U.S. shareholder s other U.S. federal income tax obligations or could be refunded to the extent it exceeds a shareholder s liability for U.S. federal income tax. A shareholder that is not subject to U.S. federal income tax or otherwise required to file a U.S. federal income tax return would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return on the appropriate form in order to claim a refund for the taxes we paid. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to our shareholders prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of the relevant taxable year. We cannot treat any of our investment company taxable income as a deemed distribution. 
 
 For purposes of determining (1) whether the Annual Distribution Requirement is satisfied for any tax year and (2) the amount of capital gain dividends paid for that tax year, we could under certain circumstances, elect to treat a dividend that is paid during the following tax year as if it had been paid during the tax year in question. If we make such an election, the U.S. shareholder will still be treated as receiving the dividend in the tax year in which the distribution is made. However, any dividend declared by us in October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us and received by our U.S. shareholders on December 31 of the calendar year in which the dividend was declared. 
 
 If an investor purchases our Common Shares shortly before the record date of a distribution, the price of our Common Shares will include the value of the distribution and the investor will be subject to tax on the distribution even though it represents a return of their investment. 
 
 A U.S. shareholder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if the shareholder sells or otherwise disposes of their Common Shares. Any gain or loss arising from such sale or disposition generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the shareholder has held their common shares for more than one year. Otherwise, it would be classified as short-term capital gain or loss. However, any capital loss arising from the sale or disposition of our Common Shares held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received, or undistributed capital gain deemed received, with respect to such shares. In addition, all or a portion of any loss recognized upon a disposition of our Common Shares could be disallowed if our Common Shares are purchased (whether through reinvestment of distributions or otherwise) within 30 days before or after the disposition. In such a case, the basis of the Common Shares acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed loss. 
 
 In general, individual U.S. shareholders are subject to a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of either 15 or 20 (depending on whether the individual U.S. shareholder s income exceeds certain threshold amounts) on their net capital gain, i.e., the excess of realized net long-term capital gain over realized net short-term capital loss for a taxable year, including a long-term capital gain derived from an investment in our Common Shares. Such rate is generally lower than the maximum U.S. federal income tax rate on ordinary taxable income currently payable by individuals. Corporate U.S. shareholders currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax on net capital gain at the maximum 21 rate also applied to ordinary income. Non-corporate shareholders incurring net capital losses for a tax year (i.e., net capital losses in excess of net capital gains) generally can deduct up to 3,000 of such losses against their ordinary income each tax year; any net capital losses of a non-corporate shareholder in excess of 3,000 generally could be carried forward and used in subsequent tax years as provided in the Code. Corporate shareholders generally cannot deduct any net capital losses for a tax year, but can carry back such losses for three tax years or carry forward such losses for five tax years. Dividends distributed by us generally will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction or the lower tax rates applicable to certain qualified dividends. 
 
 We will provide information to each of our U.S. shareholders, as promptly as possible after the end of each calendar year, a notice detailing, on a per share and per distribution basis, the amounts includible in such U.S. shareholder s taxable income for such calendar year as ordinary income and as long-term capital gain. In addition, the U.S. federal tax status of each year s distributions generally will be reported to the IRS. Distributions can also be subject to additional state, local and foreign taxes depending on a U.S. shareholder s particular situation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 We will be treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company (within the meaning of Section 67 of the Code) as a result of either (i) our common shares and our preferred shares collectively being held by at least 500 persons at all times during a taxable year, (ii) our common shares being continuously offered pursuant to a public offering (within the meaning of Section 4 of the Securities Act) or (iii) our common shares being treated as regularly traded on an established securities market. Until and unless we are treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company for any taxable year, for purposes of computing the taxable income of U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts or estates, (i) distributions from our earnings will be computed without taking into account such U.S. shareholders allocable shares of the management and incentive fees paid to GC Advisors and certain of our other expenses, (ii) each such U.S. shareholder will be treated as having paid or incurred such U.S. shareholder s allocable share of these fees and expenses and (iii) each such U.S. shareholder s allocable share of these fees and expenses will be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions by such U.S. shareholder. For taxable years beginning before 2026, miscellaneous itemized deductions generally are not deductible by a U.S. shareholder that is an individual, trust or estate. For taxable years beginning in 2026 or later, miscellaneous itemized deductions are deductible only to the extent that the aggregate of such U.S. shareholder s miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds 2 of such U.S. shareholder s adjusted gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, are not deductible for purposes of determining a U.S. shareholder s liability for the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and are subject to the overall limitation on itemized deductions under Section 68 of the Code. 
 
 The relevant withholding agent could be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax, or backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24 , from all taxable distributions to any non-corporate U.S. shareholder (1) who fails to furnish us with a correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that such shareholder is exempt from backup withholding or (2) with respect to whom the IRS notifies us that such shareholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. An individual s taxpayer identification number is the taxpayer s social security number. 
 
 Any amount withheld under backup withholding is not an additional tax and is generally allowed as a credit against the U.S. shareholder s U.S. federal income tax liability and could entitle such shareholder to a refund, provided that proper information is timely provided to the IRS. 
 
 If a U.S. shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to our Common Shares of 2 million or more for an individual shareholder or 10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on Form 8886 in accordance with IRS regulations. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer s treatment of the loss is proper. U.S. shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their specific circumstances. 
 
 An additional 3.8 Medicare tax is imposed on certain net investment income (including ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions received from us and net gains from repurchases or other taxable dispositions of our Common Shares) of U.S. individuals, estates and trusts to the extent that such person s modified adjusted gross income (in the case of an individual) or adjusted gross income (in the case of an estate or trust) exceeds certain threshold amounts. 
 
 Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders 
 
 Whether an investment in our Common Shares is appropriate for a Non-U.S. shareholder will depend upon that person s particular circumstances. An investment in our Common Shares by a Non-U.S. shareholder could have adverse tax consequences. Non-U.S. shareholders should consult their tax advisors before investing in our Common Shares. 
 
 Subject to the discussion below, distributions of our investment company taxable income to Non-U.S. shareholders (including interest income, net short-term capital gain or foreign-source dividend and interest income, which generally would be free of withholding if paid to Non-U.S. shareholders directly) generally will be subject to 
 34 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30 rate (or lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits unless the distributions are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. shareholder, in which case the distributions will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the rates applicable to U.S. persons. For a corporate Non-U.S. shareholder, distributions (both actual and deemed), and gains realized upon the sale of our Common Shares that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business could, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30 rate (or at a lower rate if provided for by an applicable treaty). In each such case, we will not be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax if the Non-U.S. shareholder complies with applicable certification and disclosure requirements. Special certification requirements apply to a Non-U.S. shareholder that is a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, and such entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors. 
 Certain properly reported dividends received by a Non-U.S. shareholder generally are exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax when they (1) are paid in respect of our qualified net interest income (generally, our U.S.-source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which we or the non-U.S. shareholder are at least a 10 shareholder, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income), or (2) are paid in connection with our qualified short-term capital gains (generally, the excess of our net short-term capital gain over our long-term capital loss for a tax year) as well as if certain other requirements are satisfied. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in the case of our Common Shares held through an intermediary, the intermediary could have withheld U.S. federal income tax even if we reported the payment as having been derived from qualified net interest income or from qualified short-term capital gains. Moreover, depending on the circumstances, we could report all, some or none of our potentially eligible dividends as derived from such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains, or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. 
 Actual or deemed distributions of our net capital gains to a Non-U.S. shareholder, and gains realized by a Non-U.S. shareholder upon the sale or other disposition of our Common Shares, will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the distributions or gains, as the case could be, are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. shareholder and, if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. shareholder in the United States or, in the case of an individual Non-U.S. shareholder, the shareholder is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the year of the sale, other disposition or capital gain dividend and if certain other conditions are met. 
 If we distribute our net capital gains in the form of deemed rather than actual distributions (which we could do in the future), a Non-U.S. shareholder will be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax credit or tax refund equal to the shareholder s allocable share of any U.S. federal income tax we incur on the capital gains deemed to have been distributed. In order to obtain the refund, the Non-U.S. shareholder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. federal income tax return even if the Non-U.S. shareholder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. federal income tax return. 
 A Non-U.S. shareholder who is a non-resident alien individual, and who is otherwise subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax, could be subject to information reporting and backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax on dividends unless the Non-U.S. shareholder provides us or the dividend paying agent with a U.S. nonresident withholding tax certification (e.g., an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or an acceptable substitute form) or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing that it is a Non-U.S. shareholder or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. 
 Pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, the applicable withholding agent is generally required to withhold U.S. tax (at a 30 rate) with respect to payments of dividends paid to certain non-U.S. entities that fail to comply (or be deemed compliant) with extensive reporting and withholding requirements designed to inform the U.S. Department of the Treasury of U.S.-owned foreign investment accounts. The information required to be reported include the identity and taxpayer identification number of each account holder and transaction activity within the holder s account. Shareholders could be requested to provide additional information to enable the applicable withholding agent to determine whether withholding is required. 
 
 An investment in shares by a non-U.S. person could also be subject to U.S. federal estate tax. Non-U.S. persons should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax, U.S. federal estate tax, withholding tax, and state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of our Common Shares.

PART II 
 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Share Issuances 
 
 We offer on a continuous basis up to 5.0 billion of Common Shares pursuant to an offering registered with the SEC. We have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits us to issue multiple share classes through Class S Shares, Class D Shares and Class I Shares with, among others, different ongoing shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees (the Public Offering ). Our Common Shares are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market and there is no established public trading market for our common shares. 
 
 As of November 26, 2024, we had 5,982 Class I shareholders of record and 428 Class S shareholders of record. 
 
 In connection with the Public Offering, we sell shares at an offering price per share as determined in accordance with our share pricing policy. Under such policy, in connection with each monthly closing on the sale of shares of Class S shares, Class D shares and Class I shares, our board of trustees has authorized GC Advisors to establish a net offering price that it believes reflects a price per share that is no less than the then-current NAV per share. The following table summarizes the net offering price per share of Common Shares in the Public Offering during the year ended September 30, 2024 and the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023:

 Distributions 
 
 Our distributions, if any, are determined by the board of trustees. We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we must distribute to our shareholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes each tax year of an amount at least equal to 90 of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable 
 84 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we are subject to ordinary income and capital gain distribution requirements under U.S. federal excise tax rules for each calendar year. If we do not meet the required distributions, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on the undistributed amount. 
 The following table reflects the cash distributions, including dividends and returns of capital per share that we have declared on our Common Shares for the year ended September 30, 2024 and the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023.

 We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our shareholders. As a result, if our board of trustees authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our shareholders who participate in our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distribution reinvested in additional common shares, rather than receiving the cash distribution.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Distribution and Servicing Plan 
 On April 4, 2023, our board of trustees approved a Distribution and Servicing Plan and on May 3, 2024 the Distribution and Servicing Plan was amended and approved for an additional one-year period. The following table shows the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees we pay the Managing Dealer with respect to the Class S Shares, Class D Shares and Class I Shares on an annualized basis as a percentage of our NAV for such class. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are paid monthly in arrears, calculated using the NAV of the applicable class as of the beginning of the first calendar day of each applicable quarter. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are calculated and paid separately for each class. Shareholder Servicing and/or Distribution Fee as a of NAV Class S Shares 0.85 Class D Shares 0.25 Class I Shares N/A 
 The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees paid under the Distribution and Servicing Plan are used primarily to compensate the Managing Dealer for such services provided in connection with the offering and sale of our shares, and/or to reimburse the Managing Dealer for related expenses incurred, including payments by the Managing Dealer to compensate or reimburse brokers, other financial institutions or other industry professionals, for distribution services and sales support services provided and related expenses. Payments of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee are also used to compensate the Managing Dealer for personal services and/or the maintenance of shareholder accounts services provided to shareholders in the related share class and could be made without regard to expenses actually incurred. 
 
 Payments of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees on behalf of a particular share class must be in consideration of services rendered for or on behalf of such class. In addition to the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, we also pay the Managing Dealer certain additional fees for its services under the Distribution and Servicing Plan, which are borne indirectly by our shareholders. Any fees paid pursuant to the Distribution and Servicing Plan may not exceed the maximum amounts, if any, as may from time to time be permitted by FINRA rules. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 At the discretion of our board of trustees, we have commenced a share repurchase program in which we intend to repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of the NAV of our Common Shares outstanding as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The board of trustees may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the best interest of shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under the share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers on or around the last business day of the first month of such quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the prior quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by us for the benefit of remaining shareholders. 
 
 The following table presents share repurchases completed under the share repurchase program during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

 We have based the forward-looking statements included in this report on information available to us on the date of this report. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future file with the SEC including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Registration Statements on Form N-2, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statistics and other data that have been obtained from or compiled from information made available by third-party service providers. We have not independently verified such statistics or data. 

Overview 
 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a business development company and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. We were formed in May 2022 as a Delaware statutory trust and commenced operations on June 30, 2023. 
 
 Our investment activities are managed by GC Advisors and supervised by our board of trustees of which a majority of the members are independent of us, GC Advisors and its affiliates. 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, dated as of April 28, 2023 and as amended and restated on November 17, 2023 and as renewed on May 3, 2024 for an additional one-year period, we have agreed to pay GC Advisors an annual base management fee based on the value of our net assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent trustees) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement. 
 We seek to invest at least 80 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) directly or indirectly in private credit investments (loans, bonds and other credit and related instruments that are issued in private offerings or issued by private companies). If we change our 80 test, we will provide shareholders with at least 60 days notice of such change. We expect to make investments that typically will have position sizes under 1 of our portfolio, on average. We expect to selectively invest more than 1 of capital in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base, particularly during the period prior to raising sufficient capital, which could result in larger individual investments when and if our capital base increases. We may invest in companies of any size or capitalization. 
 89 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which could increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.

 One stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as recurring revenue loans. Other targeted characteristics of recurring revenue businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrower s high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, one stop loans included 257.8 million and 86.5 million, respectively, of recurring revenue loans at fair value. 
 Senior secured loans include broadly syndicated loans where we do not act as lead arranger, joint lead arranger or co-manager BSL loans ). As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, senior secured loans included 667.3 million and 162.4 million, respectively, of BSL loans at fair value. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had debt and equity investments in 249 and 153 portfolio companies, respectively.

 Revenues : We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, second lien or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK, interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. 
 In addition, we generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, administrative agent fees and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment or derivative instrument, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and derivative instruments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Expenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions including: 
 organizational expenses; 
 calculating our NAV and net offering price (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);

 We have entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with GC Advisors. Under the Expense Support Agreement, GC Advisors may elect to pay certain expenses on our behalf (each, an Expense Support Payment ), provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any of our interest expense or distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees. Refer to Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements for further details on the Expense Support Agreement. 
 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. 
 
 GC Advisors, as collateral manager for our indirect, wholly owned, consolidated subsidiary, Golub Capital Private Credit Fund CLO LLC, or the 2023 Issuer, under a collateral management agreement, or the 2023 Collateral Management Agreement, is entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.35 of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2023 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2023 Collateral Management Agreement, the term collection period relating to any payment date, refers to the period commencing on the tenth business day prior to the preceding payment date and ending on (but excluding) the tenth business day prior to such payment date. 
 
 Prior to the termination of the documents governing the CLO Vehicle Credit Facility, on September 21, 2023, GC Advisors served as collateral manager for GCP SG Warehouse 2022-1, or the CLO Vehicle, under a collateral management agreement, or the CLO Vehicle Collateral Management Agreement, and was entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.25 of the average principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the CLO Vehicle during the interest period relating to each payment date, which was payable in arrears on each payment date.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 GC Advisors irrevocably waived all collateral management fees payable under the CLO Vehicle Collateral Management Agreement through the September 21, 2023 termination. 
 
 Collateral management fees were paid directly by the CLO Vehicle and are paid directly by the 2023 Issuer to GC Advisors and are offset against the management fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The 2023 Issuer, formerly the CLO Vehicle, paid SG Americas Securities, LLC structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the structuring of the 2023 Debt Securitization and CLO Vehicle Credit Facility. Term debt securitizations are also known as CLOs, and are a form of secured financing incurred by us, which are consolidated by us and subject to our overall asset coverage requirement. The 2023 Issuer also agreed to pay ongoing administrative expenses to the trustee, collateral manager, independent accountants, legal counsel, rating agencies and independent managers in connection with developing and maintaining reports, and providing required services in connection with the administration of the 2023 Debt Securitization. 
 
 We believe that these administrative expenses approximate the amount of ongoing fees and expenses that we would be required to pay in connection with a traditional secured credit facility. Our common shareholders indirectly bear all of these expenses.

 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 
 Consolidated operating results for the year ended September 30, 2024 and the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 (1) are as follows: 
 
 Year ended September 30, 2024 Period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 (In thousands) Interest income 214,332 31,407 Payment-in-kind interest income 6,844 601 Accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums 8,612 1,196 Non-cash dividend income 29 Fee income 570 132 Total investment income 230,387 33,336 Net expenses 115,288 16,381 Net investment income - before tax 115,099 16,955 Excise and income tax 109 Net investment income - after tax 114,990 16,955 Net realized gain (loss) on investment transactions (6,457) 1,596 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions 11,835 (587) Net realized gain (loss) on sale/extinguishment of debt 1,274 (1,541) Net increase in net assets resulting from operations 121,642 16,423 Average earning portfolio company investments, at fair value 1,945,690 1,039,637 Average earning preferred equity investments, at fair value 275 
 
 As we commenced operations on June 30, 2023, no income was earned prior to June 30, 2023. Net income can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. In addition, as we have continued to raise and deploy capital, we have experienced significant growth in total assets, total liabilities and net assets. As a result, quarterly and year-to-date comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful. 
 
 Investment Income 
 
 The annualized income yield by debt security type for the year ended September 30, 2024 and the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 are as follows: 
 Year ended September 30, 2024 Period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 Senior secured 9.7 11.0 One stop 11.6 11.3 Second lien 14.1 Subordinated debt 12.4 
 
 The income yield on senior secured loans decreased slightly for the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 primarily due to the impact of spread compression on new investments, amendments to existing loans, and, to a lesser extent lower interest base rates in the month of September 2024. 

(1) No comparative variance analysis was performed for the year ended September 30, 2024 and the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 due to fiscal year 2023 commencing on June 30, 2023, concurrent with our commencement of operations. 
 95 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 The income yield on one stop loans increased for the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher interest base rates outstanding for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, that was partially offset by moderating investment spreads and, to a lesser extent, reduced interest base rates in the month of September 2024. Our loan portfolio is partially insulated from a drop in floating interest rates as 96.0 of our loan portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024 is subject to an interest rate floor. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average base floor of our loans was 0.67 and 0.73 , respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have second lien investments in one portfolio company and subordinated debt investments in three portfolio companies as shown in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. Due to the limited number of second lien and subordinated debt investments, income yields on second lien and subordinated debt investments can be significantly impacted by the addition, subtraction or refinancing of one investment. 
 
 For additional details on investment yields and asset mix, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Portfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield section below. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 The following table summarizes our expenses for the year ended September 30, 2024 and the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 (1) : Year ended September 30, 2024 Period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 (In thousands) Interest expense and other debt financing expenses 70,685 10,637 Amortization of deferred debt issuance costs 2,713 87 Base management fee 14,154 2,049 Income incentive fee, net of waiver 16,592 2,034 Capital gain incentive fee accrual (reversal) under GAAP 757 Professional fees 7,587 1,414 Administrative service fee 1,976 212 General and administrative expenses 428 1,205 Distribution and shareholder servicing fees 178 Expense support (667) (1,257) Expense support recoupment 885 Net expenses 115,288 16,381 Average debt outstanding 926,243 535,035

 96 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was no Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to include the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the Capital Gain Incentive Fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there was 0.8 million in capital gain incentive fee accrual under GAAP included in management and incentive fees payable on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. As of September 30, 2023, there was no capital gain incentive fee accrual under GAAP included in management and incentive fees payable on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 
 For year ended September 30, 2024, the accrual of capital gain incentive fee under GAAP was 0.8 million. There was no accrual of capital gain incentive fee under GAAP for the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023. Any payment due under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement is calculated in arrears at the end of each calendar year. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, no Capital Gain Incentive Fees have been payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 
 Professional Fees, Administrative Service Fee, and General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 In general, we expect certain of our operating expenses, including professional fees, the administrative service fee, and other general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets during periods of growth and increase as a percentage of our total assets during periods of asset declines. 
 
 The Administrator pays for certain expenses incurred by us. These expenses are subsequently reimbursed in cash. Total expenses reimbursed to the Administrator during the year ended September 30, 2024 and the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 were 5.9 million and 3.4 million, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 During the year ended September 30, 2024, we had a net realized loss of 6.5 million primarily driven by a realized loss recognized on the restructure of a portfolio company investment and 0.6 million of realized losses recognized on the sale of two BSL loans that were partially offset by 0.1 million of net realized gains on the partial sale of BSL loans and 0.2 million of net realized gains recognized on the translation of foreign currency amounts and transactions into U.S. dollars. During the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, we had a net realized gain of 1.6 million primarily driven by the translation of foreign currency amounts and transactions into U.S. dollars. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2024, we had 20.7 million in unrealized appreciation on 177 portfolio company investments, which was offset by 9.0 million in unrealized depreciation on 97 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from fair valuing recent originations up to or near par and an increase in fair value due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from amortization of discounts on originated loans during the year and a modest decrease in market prices of certain portfolio company investments. 
 
 For the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, we had 3.2 million in unrealized appreciation on 76 portfolio company investments, which was offset by 2.5 million in unrealized depreciation on 79 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from fair valuing recent originations up to or near par and an increase in fair value due to the rise in market prices of portfolio company investments. Unrealized depreciation for the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from the amortization of discounts during the fiscal year on recently originated loans. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2024, we had a realized gain on the sale of debt of 1.3 million, which represents the gain on sale of the previously retained Class A-2 CLO Notes to a third party. For the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, we had a realized loss on extinguishment of debt of 1.5 million, which represents the unamortized discount on the notes issued under the CLO Vehicle Credit Facility at termination.

We entered into the Adviser Revolver in order to have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis and generally intend to repay borrowings under the Adviser Revolver within 30 to 45 days from which they are drawn. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no amounts outstanding under the Adviser Revolver. 
 
 Debt Securitizations 
 2023 Debt Securitization - On September 21, 2023, we completed the 2023 Debt Securitization. On September 9, 2024, we sold the previously retained Class A-2 Notes to a third party and recognized a 1.3 million realized gain on the sale. The Class A-1 and Class A-2 Notes are included in the September 30, 2024 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Class A-1 Notes are included in the September 30, 2023 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as our debt. The Subordinated 2023 Notes were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding debt under the 2023 Debt Securitization of 432.9 million and 395.5 million, respectively. 
 
 2027 Notes 
 
 On May 22, 2024, we entered into a master note purchase agreement governing the issuance of the 2027 Notes. Each of the Tranche A Notes, Tranche B Notes and Tranche C Notes remained outstanding as our debt as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 On May 8, 2024, we entered into interest rate swaps on the 2027 Notes pursuant to which we agreed to (i) receive a fixed interest rate of 7.12 and pay a floating interest rate of three-month Term SOFR plus 2.5975 on the first 225.0 million of the Tranche A Notes and (ii) receive a fixed interest rate of 7.12 and pay a floating interest rate of three-month Term SOFR plus 2.644 on the second 75.0 million of the Tranche A Notes. The interest rate swap agreements were effective as of May 22, 2024. The interest rate swaps are designated as effective hedge accounting instruments. The carrying value of the 2027 Notes is inclusive of an adjustment for the change in fair value of an effective hedge accounting relationship. 
 
 2029 Notes 
 
 On May 12, 2024, we issued 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes, all of which remained outstanding as our debt as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 On September 5, 2024, we entered into interest rate swaps on the 2029 Notes pursuant to which we agreed to (i) receive a fixed interest rate of 6.046 and pay a floating interest rate of three-month Term SOFR plus 2.7875 on the first 350.0 million of the 2029 Notes and (ii) receive a fixed interest rate of 6.046 and pay a floating interest rate of three-month Term SOFR plus 2.770 on the second 150.0 million of the 2029 Notes. The interest rate swap agreements were effective as of September 12, 2024. The interest rate swaps are designated as effective hedge accounting instruments. The carrying value of the 2029 Notes is inclusive of an adjustment for the change in fair value of an effective hedge accounting relationship.

 Asset Coverage, Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Liquidity Considerations 
 
 In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are currently allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing. On May 17, 2023, our sole shareholder approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements of Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and declined an offer by us to repurchase all our outstanding common shares. As a result of such approval, effective as of May 18, 2023, our asset coverage requirement was reduced from 200 to 150 , or a ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200 asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act. We currently intend to target a GAAP debt-to-equity ratio between 0.85x to 1.25x. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts and GAAP debt-to-equity ratio was 208.3 and GAAP debt-to-equity ratio 0.92x, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling 676.6 million and 20.8 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, total commitments of 676.6 million included 174.9 million of unfunded commitments on revolvers. There is no guarantee that these amounts will be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of September 30, 2024, subject to the terms of each loan s respective credit agreement. A summary of maturity requirements for our principal borrowings as of September 30, 2024 is included in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements. We did not have any other material contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we believe that we had sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under our unfunded commitments based on the cash balances that we maintain, availability under our SMBC Facility and Adviser Revolver, ongoing principal repayments on debt investment assets. 
 
 In addition, we have entered and, in the future, may again enter into derivative instruments that contain elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of September 30, 2024. We had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of September 30, 2023. Derivative instruments can be affected by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, which could impact the fair value of the derivative instruments. If market conditions move against us, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the derivative instruments and could realize a loss. We minimize market risk through monitoring its investments and borrowings. 
 
 Although we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future securities offerings and future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our efforts to raise capital will be successful. In addition, from time to time, we can amend, refinance, or enter into new leverage facilities and securitization financings, to the extent permitted by applicable law. In addition to capital not being available, it also could not be available on favorable terms. To the extent we are not able to raise capital on what we believe are favorable terms, we will focus on optimizing returns by investing capital generated from repayments into new investments we believe are attractive from a risk/reward perspective. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we expect to receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors allocation policy and have, in the past, received such smaller allocations under similar circumstances.

 As of September 30, 2024, 96.1 and 96.0 of our debt portfolio at amortized cost and at fair value, respectively, had interest rate floors that limit the minimum applicable interest rates on such loans. As of September 30, 2023, 97.4 of our debt portfolio at both amortized cost and at fair value had interest rate floors that limit the minimum applicable interest rates on such loans. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the portfolio median 1 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for our portfolio companies was 75.5 million and 73.6 million, respectively. The portfolio median EBITDA is based on the most recently reported trailing twelve-month EBITDA received from the portfolio company. 
 
 As part of the monitoring process, GC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. This system is not generally accepted in our industry or used by our competitors. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as GC Advisors internal performance ratings: Internal Performance Ratings Rating Definition 5 Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 4 Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. 3 Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination. The borrower could be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due. 2 Involves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments could be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). 1 Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 1 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. 
 Our internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. 
 
 For any investment rated 1, 2 or 3, GC Advisors will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. 
 
 1 The portfolio median EBITDA is based on our portfolio of debt investments and excludes (i) portfolio companies with negative or de minimis EBITDA, (ii) investments designated as recurring revenue loans and broadly syndicated loans and (iii) portfolio companies with any loans on non-accrual status.

Distributions 
 
 We have made and intend to make periodic distributions to our shareholders as determined by our board of trustees. For additional details on distributions, see Income taxes in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 
 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time. In addition, the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act could limit our ability to make distributions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure shareholders that they will receive any distributions. 
 
 Because federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations can differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences are permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. 
 
 To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any tax year, a portion of those distributions could be deemed a return of capital to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our shareholders could be the original capital invested by the shareholder rather than our 
 103 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 income or gains. Shareholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. 
 
 We have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common shareholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our shareholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional Common Shares unless a shareholder specifically opts out of our dividend reinvestment plan. If a shareholder opts out, that shareholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional Common Shares will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, shareholders participating in our dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. 

Related Party Transactions 
 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 
 We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with GC Advisors. Mr. David Golub, our chief executive officer, is a manager of GC Advisors and owns an indirect pecuniary interest in GC Advisors. 
 Golub Capital LLC provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our Administration Agreement. 
 We have entered into a license agreement with Golub Capital LLC, pursuant to which Golub Capital LLC has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Golub Capital. 
 Under the Staffing Agreement, Golub Capital LLC has agreed to provide GC Advisors with the resources necessary to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Staffing Agreement provides that Golub Capital LLC will make available to GC Advisors experienced investment professionals and provide access to the senior investment personnel of Golub Capital LLC for purposes of evaluating, negotiating, structuring, closing and monitoring our investments. The Staffing Agreement also includes a commitment that the members of GC Advisors investment committee will serve in such capacity. Services under the Staffing Agreement are provided on a direct cost reimbursement basis. We are not a party to the Staffing Agreement. 
 We entered into the Expense Support Agreement with GC Advisors, pursuant to which GC Advisors may elect to pay certain expenses on our behalf, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest or any of our distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees. 
 GC Advisors serves as collateral manager to the 2023 Issuer under the 2023 Collateral Management Agreement. Fees payable to GC Advisors for providing these services offset against the base management fee payable by us under the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 On July 3, 2023, we have entered into the Adviser Revolver with GC Advisors in order to have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis. Through a series of amendments on December 19, 2023, March 21, 2024 and June 21, 2024, we amended the Adviser Revolver to increase the borrowing capacity from 50.0 million to 300.0 million. 
 On April 27, 2023, an affiliate of GC Advisors purchased 2,000 shares of our Class F Shares of beneficial interest at 25.00 per share. 
 On July 1, 2023, we entered into the Share Purchase and Sale Agreement, with GCP HS Fund, GCP CLO Holdings Sub LP, and GC Advisors, in which we acquired all of the assets and liabilities Seed Assets of the CLO Vehicle through the purchase of 100 of the beneficial interests in, and 100 of the subordinated notes issued by the CLO Vehicle. The Seed Assets consisted of loans to 80 borrowers, cash and other assets. 
 On May 1, 2024, an affiliate of the Investment Adviser indirectly purchased 9.9 million of Class I Shares through its ownership of a feeder vehicle. 
 GC Advisors also sponsors or manages, and expects in the future to sponsor or manage, other investment funds, accounts or investment vehicles (together referred to as accounts that have investment mandates that are similar,

 in whole and in part, with ours. For example, GC Advisors presently serves as the investment adviser to Golub Capital BDC, Inc., or GBDC, a publicly-traded business development company (Nasdaq: GBDC), Golub Capital Direct Lending Corporation, or GDLC, Golub Capital Direct Lending Unlevered Corporation, or GDLCU, and Golub Capital BDC 4, Inc., or GBDC 4, which are business development companies that primarily focus on investing in one stop and other senior secured loans. In addition, our officers and trustees serve in similar capacities for GBDC, GDLC, GDLCU and GBDC 4. If GC Advisors and its affiliates determine that an investment is appropriate for us, GBDC, GDLC, GDLCU, GBDC 4 and other accounts, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, and pursuant to GC Advisors allocation policy, GC Advisors or its affiliates could determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other accounts. 
 
 We do not intend to make any investments if they are not permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, or if they are inconsistent with GC Advisors allocation procedures. 
 
 In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our and GC Advisors officers, trustees and employees. Our officers and trustees also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and Delaware law. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 

Fair Value Measurements 
 
 We value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith. 
 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, as recently amended, effective August 2, 2024, our board of trustees, as permitted, has designated GC Advisors as the our valuation designee (the Valuation Designee to perform the determination of fair value of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or valued by a third-party pricing service, in accordance with our valuation policies and procedures, subject to the oversight of the board of trustees. 
 
 Valuation methods include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, determination of the enterprise value of a portfolio company, discounted cash flow analysis and a market interest rate approach. The factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples; security covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows and the markets in which it does business; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and the principal market and enterprise values. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Valuation Designee will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments can differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and differ materially from values that are ultimately received or settled. 
 
 Our Valuation Designee is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination. 
 
 105 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Valuation Designee undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 
 Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of GC Advisors responsible for the valuation function. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and GC Advisors. The Valuation Designee reviews these preliminary valuations. At least every other quarter, the valuation for each portfolio investment, subject to a de minimis threshold, is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. The Valuation Designee discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith. 
 
 Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Under current accounting standards, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 We follow ASC Topic 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the assets or liabilities or market and the assets or liabilities complexity. Our fair value analysis, currently undertaken by the Valuation Designee, includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Assets and liabilities are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: 
 
 Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
 
 Level 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
 
 Level 3: Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information available and could require significant management judgment or estimation. 
 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value could fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset s or a liability s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability. The Valuation Designee assesses the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. During the year ended September 30, 2024, certain debt investments with a fair value of 6.5 million transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and certain debt investments with a fair value of 5.0 million transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The transfers into or out of Level 3 were primarily due to decreased or increased transparency of the observable prices. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023. The following section describes the valuation techniques used by us to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Valuation of Investments 
 
 Level 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee, based on input of the Valuation Designee s personnel and independent valuation firms that have been engaged by or at the direction of the Valuation Designee to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least every other quarter under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with each portfolio investment being reviewed at least every other quarter (subject to a de minimis threshold) with approximately 50 (based on the fair value of portfolio company investments) of our valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm. As of September 30, 2024, 615.7 million and 2,649.6 million of investments were valued using Level 2 inputs and Level 3 inputs, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, 139.9 million and 1,038.7 million of investments were valued using Level 2 inputs and Level 3 inputs, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, all interest rate swaps were valued using Level 2 inputs. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, all money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents were valued using Level 1 inputs. 
 
 When determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Valuation Designee may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that could affect the price at which similar investments could be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company s EBITDA. A portfolio company s EBITDA could include pro-forma adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Valuation Designee will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Valuation Designee uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value. 
 
 In addition, for certain debt investments, the Valuation Designee could base its valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others could be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others could be willing to accept. The Valuation Designee generally uses the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment. 
 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments could differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for such investments and could differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded. 
 
 Our investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded. 
 
 In connection with each sale of our Common Shares, we make a determination that we are not selling Common Shares at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of common shares at the time at which the sale is made or otherwise in violation of the 1940 Act. GC Advisors will consider the following factors, among others, in making such determination: 
 
 The net asset value of our Common Shares disclosed in the most recent periodic report filed with the SEC;

 Its assessment of whether any change in the net asset value per share of our Common Shares has occurred (including through the realization of gains on the sale of portfolio securities) during the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value per share of our Common Shares and ending on the date on which the offering price for such month is determined; and 
 The magnitude of the difference between the sale price of the shares of commons shares and management s assessment of any change in the net asset value per share of our Common Shares during the period discussed above. 

Valuation of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities 
 
 The fair value of the 2029 Notes is based on vendor pricing received by the Company, which is considered a Level 2 input. The fair value of our remaining debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using comparable market rates or market quotes for similar instruments at the measurement date, if available. 
 
 Revenue Recognition: 
 
 Our revenue recognition policies are as follows: 
 
 Investments and Related Investment Income: Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments. Original issue discount, market discount or premium and certain loan origination or amendment fees that are deemed to be an adjustment to yield Loan Origination Fees are capitalized and we accrete or amortize such amounts over the life of the loan as interest income Discount Amortization ). For investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not likely to be collectible. In addition, we could generate revenue in the form of amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, administrative agent fees, consulting fees and prepayment premiums on loans that are not deemed to be an adjustment to yield and record these fees as fee income when earned. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. We have certain preferred equity securities in our portfolio that contain a PIK dividend provision that are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The accrued PIK and non-cash dividends are capitalized to the cost basis of the preferred equity security and are generally collected when redeemed by the issuer. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from limited liability company, or LLC, and limited partnership, or LP, investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. 
 
 We account for investment transactions on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We report changes in fair value of investments from the prior period that is measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and fluctuations arising from the translation of foreign exchange rates on investments in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Non-accrual loans: Loans may be left on accrual status during the period we are pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on non-accrual status. We generally reverse accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. We restore non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest is 
 108 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 paid and, in our management s judgment, are likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no portfolio company investments on non-accrual status. 
 
 Income taxes: We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, as well as timely distribute to our shareholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each tax year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes on amounts distributed. 
 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. We could then be required to incur a 4 excise tax on such income. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the year ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 0.1 million for U.S. federal excise tax. For the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, we did not record any U.S. federal excise tax. 
 
 Because federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations could differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences could be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification could result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and changes in interest rates. 
 
 Valuation Risk. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price. To ensure accurate valuations, our investments are valued at fair value in good faith by the Investment Adviser, as our valuation designee, subject to the oversight of our board of trustees based on, among other things, the input of independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the valuation designee, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the investments we hold. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments could fluctuate from period to period, if we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk. Many of the loans in our portfolio have floating interest rates, and we expect that our loans in the future could also have floating interest rates. These loans are usually based on floating SOFR or another base rate and typically have interest rate reset provisions that adjust applicable interest rates under such loans to current market rates on a daily, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. The loans that are subject to floating SOFR or another base rate are also typically subject to a minimum base rate, or floor, that we charge on our loans if the current market rates are below the respective floors. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average floor on loans subject to floating interest rates was 0.67 and 0.73 , respectively. The SMBC Credit Facility has a floating interest rate provision primarily based on an applicable base rate (as defined in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements), the Adviser Revolver has a floating interest rate provision equal to the short-term Applicable Federal Rate, the Class A-1 Notes and Class A-2 Notes issued in connection with the 2023 Debt Securitization have floating rate interest provisions based on three-month term SOFR and the Tranche B Notes and Tranche C Notes have floating rate interest provisions based on SOFR and EURIBOR, respectively. We have entered into two interest rate swaps on the Tranche A Notes which have floating rate provisions based on three-month SOFR plus a spread of 2.5975 and three-month SOFR plus a spread of 2.644 . We have entered into two interest rate swaps on the 2029 Notes which have floating rate provisions based on three-month SOFR plus a spread of 2.7875 and three-month 
 109 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 SOFR plus a spread of 2.770 . We expect that other credit facilities into which we enter in the future could have floating interest rate provisions. 
 
 Assuming that the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter interest rate sensitivity as of such date, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates: 
 Change in interest rates Increase (decrease) in 
 interest income (1) 
 Increase (decrease) in interest expense Net increase (decrease) in investment income (In thousands) Down 200 basis points (48,289) (29,136) (19,153) Down 150 basis points (36,217) (21,852) (14,365) Down 100 basis points (24,144) (14,568) (9,576) Down 50 basis points (12,072) (7,284) (4,788) Up 50 basis points 12,072 7,284 4,788 Up 100 basis points 24,144 14,568 9,576 Up 150 basis points 36,217 21,852 14,365 Up 200 basis points 48,289 29,136 19,153 
 
 (1) Assumes applicable three-month base rate as of September 30, 2024, with the exception of SONIA and Prime that utilize the September 30, 2024 rate. 
 Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes as of September 30, 2024, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowings under the SMBC Credit Facility, the Adviser Revolver, the 2023 Debt Securitization, or other borrowings, that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above. 
 
 We have and, in the future, could hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts to the limited extent permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities could insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they could also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates.

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 The management of Golub Capital Private Credit Fund GCRED, and collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company, we, us, and our is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of trustees regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 GCRED s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions recorded necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our policies and procedures also provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the trustees of GCRED, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness as to future years are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of GCRED s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued in 2013. Based on the assessment, management believes that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Trustees of Golub Capital Private Credit Fund and Subsidiaries 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Golub Capital Private Credit Fund and Subsidiaries (the Company), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2024 and the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets, and its cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2024 and the period from June 30, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, by correspondence with the custodians. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 The following section describes the valuation techniques used to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized. 
 
 Investments 
 
 Level 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee, based on input of the Valuation Designee s personnel and independent valuation firms that have been engaged by or at the direction of the Valuation Designee to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least every other quarter under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with each portfolio investment being reviewed at least every other quarter (subject to a de minimis threshold) with approximately 50 (based on the fair value of the portfolio company investments) of the Company s valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm.

 The above tables are not intended to be all-inclusive but rather to provide information on significant unobservable inputs and valuation techniques used by the Valuation Designee. 
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt and equity investments are EBITDA multiples, revenue multiples and market interest rates. The Valuation Designee uses EBITDA multiples and, to a lesser extent, revenue multiples on the Company s debt and equity investments to determine any credit gains or losses. Increases or decreases in either of these inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The Valuation Designee uses market interest rates for loans to determine if the effective yield on a loan is commensurate with the market yields for that type of loan. If a loan s effective yield was significantly less than the market yield for a similar loan with a similar credit profile, then the resulting fair value of the loan could have been lower. 
 
 Other Financial Assets and Liabilities 
 
 ASC Topic 820 requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate such value. As a result, with the exception of the line item titled debt which is reported at cost, all assets and liabilities approximate fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition due to their short maturity. The fair value of the Company's 2029 Notes is based on vendor pricing received by the Company, which is considered a Level 2 input. The fair value of the Company s remaining debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using comparable market rates or market quotes for similar instruments at the measurement date, if available. 

(1) As of September 30, 2024 , carrying value is inclusive of an adjustment for the change in fair value of an effective hedge accounting relationship related to the Tranche A Notes and 2029 Notes. See Note 5 for additional information.

Exhibit 4.3 
 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES 
 
 For purposes of this exhibit, references to we, our , the Company , the Fund and us refer only to Golub Capital Private Credit Fund and not to any of its current or future subsidiaries and references to subsidiaries refer only to consolidated subsidiaries of and exclude any investments held by Golub Capital Private Credit Fund in the ordinary course of business which are not, under GAAP, consolidated on the financial statements of Golub Capital Private Credit Fund and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this Description of Securities is attached as an exhibit. 
 
 The following description is based on relevant portions of our declaration of trust (as amended, the Declaration of Trust and bylaws, each of which is filed as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.3 is a part. This summary is not necessarily complete, and we refer you to the Declaration of Trust and bylaws for a more detailed description of the provisions summarized below. 
 
 General 
 
 The terms of the Declaration of Trust authorize an unlimited number of common shares of any class, par value 0.01 per share, and an unlimited number of shares of preferred shares, par value 0.01 per share. The Declaration of Trust provides that the board of trustees may classify or reclassify any unissued common shares into one or more classes or series of common shares or preferred shares by setting or changing the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, or limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption of the shares. There is currently no market for our common shares, and we can offer no assurances that a market for our shares will develop in the future. We do not intend for the shares to be listed on any national securities exchange. There are no outstanding options or warrants to purchase our shares. No shares have been authorized for issuance under any equity compensation plans. Under the terms of our Declaration of Trust, shareholders shall be entitled to the same limited liability extended to shareholders of private Delaware for profit corporations formed under the Delaware General Corporation Law, 8 Del. C. 100, et. seq. Our Declaration of Trust provides that no shareholder shall be liable for any debt, claim, demand, judgment or obligation of any kind of, against or with respect to us by reason of being a shareholder, nor shall any shareholder be subject to any personal liability whatsoever, in tort, contract or otherwise, to any person in connection with our assets or our affairs by reason of being a shareholder. 
 
 None of our shares are subject to further calls or to assessments, sinking fund provisions, obligations of us or potential liabilities associated with ownership of the security (not including investment risks). In addition, except as may be provided by the board of trustees in setting the terms of any class or series of common shares, no shareholder shall be entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with any transaction. 
 
 The Company is conducting a continuous offering of common shares of beneficial interest pursuant to an offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), consisting of Class S common shares Class S shares ), Class D common shares Class D shares and Class I common shares Class I shares ). 
 
 Common Shares 
 
 Under the terms of our Declaration of Trust, all common shares will have equal rights as to voting and, when they are issued, are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Dividends and distributions may be paid to the holders of our common shares if, as, and when authorized by our board of trustees and declared by us out of funds legally available therefore. Except as may be provided by our board of trustees in setting the terms of classified or reclassified shares, our common shares will have no preemptive, exchange, conversion, appraisal or redemption rights and will be freely transferable, except where their transfer is restricted by federal and state securities laws or by contract and except that, in order to avoid the possibility that our assets could be treated as plan assets, we may require any person proposing to acquire common shares to furnish such information as may 
 1 

be necessary to determine whether such person is a benefit plan investor or a controlling person, restrict or prohibit transfers of such shares or redeem any outstanding shares for such price and on such other terms and conditions as may be determined by or at the direction of the board of trustees. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each share of our common shares would be entitled to share pro rata in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we pay all debts and other liabilities and subject to any preferential rights of holders of our preferred shares, if any preferred shares are outstanding at such time. Subject to the rights of holders of any other class or series of shares, each share of our common shares will be entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, including the election of trustees. Except as may be provided by the board of trustees in setting the terms of classified or reclassified shares, and subject to the express terms of any class or series of preferred shares, the holders of our common shares will possess exclusive voting power. There will be no cumulative voting in the election of trustees. Subject to the special rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred shares to elect trustees, each trustee will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast with respect to such trustee s election except in the case of a contested election (as defined in our bylaws), in which case trustees will be elected by a majority of the votes cast in the contested election of trustees. Pursuant to our Declaration of Trust, our board of trustees may amend the bylaws to alter the vote required to elect trustees. 
 
 Class S Shares 
 
 No upfront selling commissions are paid for sales of any Class S shares, however, if you purchase Class S shares from certain financial intermediaries, they may directly charge you transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, in such amount as they may determine, provided that selling agents limit such charges to a 3.5 cap on the net offering price for Class S shares. 
 
 We pay the Managing Dealer selling commissions over time as a shareholder servicing and or distribution fee with respect to our outstanding Class S shares equal to 0.85 per annum of the aggregate NAV of our outstanding Class S shares, including any Class S shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. The shareholder servicing and or distribution fees are paid monthly in arrears. The Managing Dealer reallows (pays) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and or distribution fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers, and will waive shareholder servicing and or distribution fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. 
 
 Class D Shares 
 
 No upfront selling commissions are paid for sales of any Class D shares, however, if you purchase Class D shares from certain financial intermediaries, they may directly charge you transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, in such amount as they may determine, provided that selling agents limit such charges to a 1.5 cap on the net offering price for Class D shares. 
 
 We pay the Managing Dealer selling commissions over time as a shareholder servicing and or distribution fee with respect to our outstanding Class D shares equal to 0.25 per annum of the aggregate NAV of all our outstanding Class D shares, including any Class D shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. The shareholder servicing and or distribution fees are paid monthly in arrears. The Managing Dealer reallows (pays) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and or distribution fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers, and will waive shareholder servicing and or distribution fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. 
 
 Class D shares are generally available for purchase only (1) through fee-based programs, also known as wrap accounts, that provide access to Class D shares, (2) through participating brokers that have alternative fee arrangements with their clients to provide access to Class D shares, (3) through transaction brokerage platforms at participating brokers, (4) through certain registered investment advisers, (5) through bank trust departments or any other organization or person authorized to act in a fiduciary capacity for its clients or customers or (6) by other categories of investors that we name in an amendment or supplement to a prospectus. 
 
 2 

Class I Shares 
 
 No upfront selling commissions or shareholder servicing and or distribution fees are paid for sales of any Class I shares and financial intermediaries will not charge you transaction or other such fees on Class I Shares. 
 
 Class I shares are generally available for purchase only (1) through fee-based programs, also known as wrap accounts, that provide access to Class I shares, (2) by endowments, foundations, pension funds and other institutional investors, (3) through participating brokers that have alternative fee arrangements with their clients to provide access to Class I shares, (4) through certain registered investment advisers, (5) by our executive officers and trustees and their immediate family members, as well as officers and employees of the Investment Adviser, Golub Capital or other affiliates and their immediate family members, and joint venture partners, consultants and other service providers or (6) by other categories of investors that we name in an amendment or supplement to a prospectus. In certain cases, where a holder of Class S or Class D shares exits a relationship with a participating broker and does not enter into a new relationship with a participating broker, such holder s shares may be exchanged into an equivalent NAV amount of Class I shares. 
 
 Other Terms of Common Shares 
 
 We will cease paying the shareholder servicing and or distribution fees on the Class S shares and Class D shares on the earlier to occur of the following (i) a listing of Class I shares, (ii) our merger or consolidation with or into another entity, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or (iii) the date following the completion of a offering on which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources in connection with a offering, including the shareholder servicing and or distribution fees and other underwriting compensation, is equal to 10 of the gross proceeds from the offering. In addition, consistent with the exemptive relief that permits the Company to issue multiple classes of shares, at the end of the month in which the Managing Dealer in conjunction with the transfer agent determines that total transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, and shareholder servicing and or distribution fees paid with respect to the shares held in a shareholder s account would exceed, in the aggregate, 10 of the gross proceeds from the sale of such shares (or a lower limit as determined by the Managing Dealer or the applicable selling agent), we will cease paying the shareholder servicing and or distribution fees on the Class S shares and Class D shares in such shareholder s account. Compensation paid with respect to the shares in a shareholder s account will be allocated among each share such that the compensation paid with respect to each individual share will not exceed 10 of the offering price of such share. We may modify this requirement in a manner that is consistent with applicable exemptive relief. At the end of such month, the Class S shares or Class D shares in such shareholder s account will convert into a number of Class I shares (including any fractional shares), with an equivalent aggregate NAV as such Class S or Class D shares. In addition, immediately before any liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each Class S share and Class D share will automatically convert into a number of Class I shares (including any fractional shares) with an equivalent NAV as such share. 
 
 Preferred Shares 
 
 Under the terms of the Declaration of Trust, our board of trustees may authorize us to issue preferred shares in one or more classes or series without shareholder approval, to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act ). The board of trustees has the power to fix the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of each class or series of preferred shares. We do not currently anticipate issuing preferred shares in the near future. In the event we issue preferred shares, we will make any required disclosure to shareholders. We will not offer preferred shares to the Investment Adviser or our affiliates except on the same terms as offered to all other shareholders. 
 
 Preferred shares could be issued with terms that would adversely affect the shareholders, provided that we may not issue any preferred shares that would limit or subordinate the voting rights of holders of our common shares. Preferred shares could also be used as an anti-takeover device through the issuance of shares of a class or series of preferred shares with terms and conditions which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a 
 3 

transaction or a change in control. Every issuance of preferred shares will be required to comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act requires, among other things, that (1) immediately after issuance and before any dividend or other distribution is made with respect to common shares and before any purchase of common shares is made, such preferred shares together with all other senior securities must not exceed an amount equal to 50 of our total assets after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, and (2) the holders of shares of preferred shares, if any are issued, must be entitled as a class voting separately to elect two trustees at all times and to elect a majority of the trustees if distributions on such preferred shares are in arrears by two full years or more. Certain matters under the 1940 Act require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred shares (as determined in accordance with the 1940 Act) voting together as a separate class. For example, the vote of such holders of preferred shares would be required to approve a proposal involving a plan of reorganization adversely affecting such securities. 
 
 The issuance of any preferred shares must be approved by a majority of our independent trustees not otherwise interested in the transaction, who will have access, at our expense, to our legal counsel or to independent legal counsel. 
 
 Limitation on Liability of Trustees and Officers Indemnification and Advance of Expenses 
 
 Delaware law permits a Delaware statutory trust to include in its declaration of trust a provision to indemnify and hold harmless any trustee or beneficial owner or other person from and against any and all claims and demands whatsoever. Our Declaration of Trust provides that our trustees will not be liable to us or our shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a trustee to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Our Declaration of Trust provides for the indemnification of any person to the full extent permitted, and in the manner provided, by Delaware law. In accordance with the 1940 Act, we will not indemnify certain persons for any liability to which such persons would be subject by reason of such person s willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office. 
 
 Pursuant to our Declaration of Trust and subject to certain exceptions described therein, we will indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to (i) any individual who is a present or former trustee or officer and who is made or threatened to be made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity or (ii) any individual who, while a trustee or officer and at our request , serves or has served as a trustee, officer, partner or trustee of any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise and who is made or threatened to be made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity (each such person, an Indemnitee ), in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not provide indemnification for any loss, liability or expense arising from or out of an alleged violation of federal or state securities laws by an Indemnitee unless (i) there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged securities law violations, (ii) such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against the Indemnitee and finds that indemnification of the settlement and the related costs should be made and the court considering the request for indemnification has been advised of the position of the SEC and of the published position of any state securities regulatory authority in which securities were offered or sold as to indemnification for violations of securities laws. 
 
 We will not indemnify an Indemnitee against any liability or loss suffered by such Indemnitee unless (i) we determine in good faith that the course of conduct that caused the loss or liability was in our best interest, (ii) the Indemnitee was acting on behalf of or performing services for us, (iii) such liability or loss was not the result of (A) negligence or misconduct, in the case that the party seeking indemnification is a trustee (other than an independent trustee), officer, employee, controlling person or agent, or (B) gross negligence or willful misconduct, in the case that the party seeking indemnification is an independent trustee, and (iv) such indemnification or agreement to hold harmless is recoverable only out of our assets and not from the shareholders. 
 
 In addition, the Declaration of Trust permits the Company to advance reasonable expenses to an Indemnitee, and we will do so in advance of final disposition of a proceeding (a) if the proceeding relates to acts or omissions with 
 4 

respect to the performance of duties or services on behalf of the Company, (b) the legal proceeding was initiated by a third party who is not a shareholder or, if by a shareholder of the Fund acting in his or her capacity as such, a court of competent jurisdiction approves such advancement and (c) upon the Fund s receipt of (i) a written affirmation by the trustee or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Company and (ii) a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the Company, together with the applicable legal rate of interest thereon, if it is ultimately determined that the standard of conduct was not met. 
 
 Delaware Law and Certain Declaration of Trust Provisions 
 
 Organization and Duration 
 
 We were formed in Delaware on May 13, 2022, and will remain in existence until dissolved in accordance with our Declaration of Trust or pursuant to Delaware law. 
 
 Purpose 
 
 Under the Declaration of Trust, we are permitted to engage in any business activity that lawfully may be conducted by a statutory trust organized under Delaware law and, in connection therewith, to exercise all of the rights and powers conferred upon us pursuant to the agreements relating to such business activity. 
 
 Our Declaration of Trust contains provisions that could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. Our board of trustees may, without shareholder action, authorize the issuance of shares in one or more classes or series, including preferred shares our board of trustees may, without shareholder action, amend our Declaration of Trust to increase the number of our Common Shares, of any class or series, that we will have authority to issue and our Declaration of Trust provides that, while we do not intend to list our shares on any securities exchange, if any class of our shares is listed on a national securities exchange, our board of trustees will be divided into three classes of trustees serving staggered terms of three years each. These provisions are expected to discourage certain coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of trustees. We believe that the benefits of these provisions outweigh the potential disadvantages of discouraging any such acquisition proposals because, among other things, the negotiation of such proposals may improve their terms.

In addition, the Investment Adviser will be prohibited from providing financing to us with a term in excess of 12 months. 
 
 Number of Trustees Vacancies Removal 
 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that the number of trustees will be set by our board of trustees in accordance with our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that a majority of our entire board of trustees may at any time increase or decrease the number of trustees. Our Declaration of Trust provides that the number of trustees generally may not be less than three. Except as otherwise required by applicable requirements of the 1940 Act and as may be provided by our board of trustees in setting the terms of any class or series of preferred shares, pursuant to an election under our Declaration of Trust, any and all vacancies on our board of trustees may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining trustees in office, even if the remaining trustees do not constitute a quorum, and any trustee elected to fill a vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the trustee for whom the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualified, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. 
 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that a trustee may be removed only for cause and only by a majority of the remaining trustees (or in the case of the removal of a trustee that is not an interested person, a majority of the remaining trustees that are not interested persons) followed by the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75 of the shares then entitled to vote in an election of such trustee. Our Declaration of Trust provides that, notwithstanding the foregoing provision, any trustee may be removed with or without cause upon the vote of a majority of then-outstanding shares. 
 
 Our board of trustees is comprised of a total of seven members of our board of trustees, five of whom are independent trustees. Our Declaration of Trust provides that a majority of our board of trustees must be independent trustees (as that term is defined under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) except for a period of up to 60 days after the death, removal or resignation of an independent trustee pending the election of his or her successor. Each trustee will hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. While we do not intend to list our shares on any securities exchange, if any class of our shares is listed on a national securities exchange, our board of trustees will be divided into three classes of trustees serving staggered terms of three years each.

Action by Shareholders 
 
 Our bylaws provide that shareholder action can be taken at an annual meeting or a special meeting of shareholders. The shareholders will only have voting rights as required by the 1940 Act or as otherwise provided for in the Declaration of Trust. We will hold annual meetings. Special meetings may be called by the trustees and certain of our officers, and will be limited to the purposes for any such special meeting set forth in the notice thereof. In addition, our Declaration of Trust provides that, subject to the satisfaction of certain procedural and informational requirements by the shareholders requesting the meeting, a special meeting of shareholders will be called by our secretary upon the written request of shareholders entitled to cast 10 or more of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting. The secretary shall provide all shareholders, within ten days after receipt of said request, written notice either in person or by mail of the date, time and location of such requested special meeting and the purpose of the meeting. Any special meeting called by such shareholders is required to be held not less than fifteen nor more than 60 days after notice is provided to shareholders of the special meeting. These provisions will have the effect of significantly reducing the ability of shareholders being able to have proposals considered at a meeting of shareholders. 
 
 With respect to special meetings of shareholders, only the business specified in our notice of the meeting may be brought before the meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the board of trustees at a special meeting may be made only (1) pursuant to our notice of the meeting, (2) by the board of trustees or (3) provided that the board of trustees has determined that trustees will be elected at the meeting, by a shareholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice provisions of the Declaration of Trust. 
 
 Our Declaration of Trust also provides that, subject to the provisions of any class or series of shares then outstanding and the mandatory provisions of any applicable laws or regulations or other provisions of the Declaration of Trust, the following actions may be taken by the shareholders, without concurrence by our board of trustees or the Investment Adviser, upon a vote by the holders of more than 50 of the outstanding shares entitled to vote to 
 
 modify the Declaration of Trust 
 remove the Investment Adviser or appoint a new investment adviser 
 dissolve the Company 
 sell all or substantially all of our assets other than in the ordinary course of business or 
 remove any trustee with or without cause (provided the aggregate number of trustees after such removal shall not be less than the minimum required by the Declaration of Trust). 
 
 The purpose of requiring shareholders to give us advance notice of nominations and other business is to afford our board of trustees a meaningful opportunity to consider the qualifications of the proposed nominees and the advisability of any other proposed business and, to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by our board of trustees, to inform shareholders and make recommendations about such qualifications or business, as well as to provide a more orderly procedure for conducting meetings of shareholders. Although our Declaration of Trust does not give our board of trustees any power to disapprove shareholder nominations for the election of trustees or proposals recommending certain action, they may have the effect of precluding a contest for the election of trustees or the consideration of shareholder proposals if proper procedures are not followed and of discouraging or deterring a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of trustees or to approve its own proposal without regard to whether consideration of such nominees or proposals might be harmful or beneficial to us and our shareholders. 
 
 Our Investment Adviser may not, without the approval of a vote by the holders of more than 50 of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such matters 
 
 modify the Investment Advisory Agreement except for amendments that would not adversely affect the rights of our shareholders 
 7 

except as otherwise permitted under the Investment Advisory Agreement, voluntarily withdraw as our investment adviser unless such withdrawal would not affect our tax status and would not materially adversely affect our shareholders 
 appoint a new investment adviser (other than a sub-adviser pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and applicable law) 
 sell all or substantially all of our assets other than in the ordinary course of our business or as otherwise permitted by law or 
 cause the merger or similar reorganization of the Company. 
 Amendment of the Declaration of Trust and Bylaws 
 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that shareholders are entitled to vote upon a proposed amendment to the Declaration of Trust if the amendment would adversely affect the rights of shareholders. Approval of any such amendment must be approved by the holders of more than 50 of our outstanding shares entitled to vote on the matter. In addition, the affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter are necessary to effect (a) any amendment to our Declaration of Trust to make our common shares a redeemable security or to convert the Company, whether by merger or otherwise, from a closed-end company to an open-end company and (b) any amendment to certain specific provisions of our Declaration of Trust. If the board of trustees approves a proposal or amendment pursuant to the prior sentence by a vote of at least two-thirds of such board of trustees, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of more than 50 of our outstanding shares entitled to vote on the matter shall be required to approve such matter. 
 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that our board of trustees has the exclusive power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws and to make new bylaws provided, however, that if any amendment to our bylaws adversely affects the voting rights of shareholders, such amendment must be approved by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding securities entitled to vote on the matter, which means the lesser of (1) 67 or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50 of the outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy, or (2) more than 50 of the outstanding voting securities. Except as described above and for certain provisions of our Declaration of Trust relating to shareholder voting and the removal of trustees, our Declaration of Trust provides that our board of trustees may amend our Declaration of Trust without any vote of our shareholders. 
 
 Actions by the Board Related to Merger, Conversion or Reorganization 
 
 The board of trustees may, without the approval of holders of our outstanding shares, approve a merger, conversion, consolidation or other reorganization of the Company, provided that the resulting entity is a business development company under the 1940 Act. We will not permit the Investment Adviser to cause any other form of merger or other reorganization of the Company without the affirmative vote by the holders of more than fifty percent (50 of the our outstanding shares entitled to vote on the matter. 
 
 Derivative Actions 
 
 No person, other than a trustee, who is not a shareholder shall be entitled to bring any derivative action, suit or other proceeding on behalf of the Company. No shareholder may maintain a derivative action on behalf of the Company unless holders of at least ten percent (10 of the outstanding shares join in the bringing of such action. A derivative action does not include any derivative or other action arising under the U.S. federal securities laws and certain state securities laws. 
 
 In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 3816 of the Delaware Statutory Trust Statute, a shareholder may bring a derivative action on behalf of the Company only if the following conditions are met (i) the shareholder or shareholders must make a pre-suit demand upon the board of trustees to bring the subject action unless an effort to cause the board of trustees to bring such an action is not likely to succeed and a demand on the board of trustees shall only be deemed not likely to succeed and therefore excused if a majority of the board of trustees, or a majority of any committee established to consider the merits of such action, is composed of board of trustees who are not independent trustees (as that term is defined in the Delaware Statutory Trust Statute) and (ii) unless a demand is 
 8 

not required under clause (i) above, the board of trustees must be afforded a reasonable amount of time to consider such shareholder request and to investigate the basis of such claim and the board of trustees shall be entitled to retain counsel or other advisors in considering the merits of the request and may require an undertaking by the shareholders making such request to reimburse the Company for the expense of any such advisors in the event that the board of trustees determine not to bring such action. For purposes of this paragraph, the board of trustees may designate a committee of one or more trustees to consider a shareholder demand. 
 
 Restrictions on Roll-Up Transactions 
 
 In connection with a proposed roll-up transaction, which, in general terms, is any transaction involving the acquisition, merger, conversion or consolidation, directly or indirectly, of us and the issuance of securities of an entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction, we will obtain an appraisal of all of our properties from an independent expert. In order to qualify as an independent expert for this purpose, the person or entity must have no material current or prior business or personal relationship with us and must be engaged to a substantial extent in the business of rendering opinions regarding the value of assets of the type held by us, who is qualified to perform such work. Our assets will be appraised on a consistent basis, and the appraisal will be based on the evaluation of all relevant information and will indicate the value of our assets as of a date immediately prior to the announcement of the proposed roll-up transaction. The appraisal will assume an orderly liquidation of our assets over a 12-month period. The terms of the engagement of such independent expert will clearly state that the engagement is for our benefit and the benefit of our shareholders. We will include a summary of the appraisal, indicating all material assumptions underlying the appraisal, in a report to the shareholders in connection with the proposed roll-up transaction. If the appraisal will be included in a prospectus used to offer the securities of the roll-up entity, the appraisal will be filed with the SEC and the states as an exhibit to the registration statement. 
 
 In connection with a proposed roll-up transaction, the person sponsoring the roll-up transaction must offer to the shareholders who vote against the proposal a choice of 
 
 accepting the securities of the entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction offered in the proposed roll-up transaction or 
 one of the following 
 remaining as shareholders and preserving their interests in us on the same terms and conditions as existed previously or 
 receiving cash in an amount equal to their pro rata share of the appraised value of our net assets. 
 
 We are prohibited from participating in any proposed roll-up transaction 
 
 which would result in shareholders having voting rights in the entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction that are less than those provided in the Declaration of Trust, including rights with respect to the election and removal of trustees, annual and special meetings, amendments to the Declaration of Trust and our dissolution 
 which includes provisions that would operate as a material impediment to, or frustration of, the accumulation of common shares by any purchaser of the securities of the entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction, except to the minimum extent necessary to preserve the tax status of such entity, or which would limit the ability of an investor to exercise the voting rights of its securities of the entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction on the basis of the number of shares held by that investor 
 in which shareholders rights to access to records of the entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction will be less than those provided in the Declaration of Trust 
 in which we would bear any of the costs of the roll-up transaction if the shareholders reject the roll-up transaction or 
 9 

unless the organizational documents of the entity that would survive the roll-up transaction provide that neither its adviser nor its intermediary-manager may vote or consent on matters submitted to its shareholders regarding the removal of its adviser or any transaction between it and its adviser or any of 
 
 Access to Records 
 
 Any shareholder will be permitted access to all of our records to which they are entitled under applicable law at all reasonable times and may inspect and copy any of them for a reasonable copying charge. Inspection of our records by the office or agency administering the securities laws of a jurisdiction will be provided upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours. An alphabetical list of the names, addresses and business telephone numbers of our shareholders, along with the number of common shares held by each of them, will be maintained as part of our books and records and will be available for inspection by any shareholder or the shareholder s designated agent at our office. The shareholder list will be updated at least quarterly to reflect changes in the information contained therein. A copy of the list will be mailed to any shareholder who requests the list within ten days of the request. A shareholder may request a copy of the shareholder list for any proper and legitimate purpose, including, without limitation, in connection with matters relating to voting rights and the exercise of shareholder rights under federal proxy laws. A shareholder requesting a list will be required to pay reasonable costs of postage and duplication. Such copy of the shareholder list shall be printed in alphabetical order, on white paper, and in readily readable type size (no smaller than 10 point font). 
 
 A shareholder may also request access to any other corporate records. If a proper request for the shareholder list or any other corporate records is not honored, then the requesting shareholder will be entitled to recover certain costs incurred in compelling the production of the list or other requested corporate records as well as actual damages suffered by reason of the refusal or failure to produce the list. However, a shareholder will not have the right to, and we may require a requesting shareholder to represent that it will not, secure the shareholder list or other information for the purpose of selling or using the list for a commercial purpose not related to the requesting shareholder s interest in our affairs. We may also require that such shareholder sign a confidentiality agreement in connection with the request.

 Notwithstanding the reporting requirements set forth in this Section V, an Independent Director who would be required to make a report under this Section V solely by reason of being a director of the Corporation is not required to file a Personal Securities Holding Report upon becoming a director of the Corporation or annually thereafter. Such an Independent Director also need not file a Quarterly Securities Transaction Report unless such director knew or, in the ordinary course of fulfilling official duties as a director of the Corporation, should have known that during the 15-day period immediately preceding or after the date of the transaction in a Covered Security by the director such Covered Security is or was purchased or sold by the Corporation or the Corporation or the Adviser considered purchasing or selling such Covered Security. 
 (D) Access Persons of the Adviser. 
 An Access Person of the Adviser need not make a Personal Securities Holding Report or Quarterly Securities Transaction Report if the information in such reports would duplicate information required to be recorded pursuant to the Adviser s Code of Ethics. 
 (E) Brokerage Accounts and Statements. 
 Access Persons, except Independent Directors, shall 
 (1) instruct the brokers, dealers or banks with whom they maintain such an account to provide duplicate account statements to the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 (2) on an annual basis, certify that they have complied with the requirements of (1) above. 
 (F) Form of Reports. 
 A Quarterly Securities Transaction Report may consist of broker statements or other statements that provide a list of all personal Covered Securities holdings and transactions in the time period covered by the report and contain the information required in a Quarterly Securities Transaction Report. 
 (G) Responsibility to Report. 
 Access Persons will be informed of their obligations to report, however, it is the responsibility of each Access Person to take the initiative to comply with the requirements of this Section V. Any effort by the Corporation, or by the Adviser and its affiliates, to facilitate the reporting process does not change or alter that responsibility. A person need not make a report hereunder with respect to transactions effected for, and Covered Securities held in, any account over which the person has no direct or indirect influence or control. 

Exhibit 14.1 

(H) Where to File Reports and Forms. 
 (1) All Quarterly Securities Transaction Reports and Personal Securities Holdings Reports, as well as Private Company Securities and IPO Request and Reporting Forms, must be filed with the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 (2) The Chief Compliance Officer may, from time to time, adopt new methods to submit all Quarterly Securities Transaction Reports and Personal Securities Holdings Reports, as well as Private Company Securities and IPO Request and Reporting Forms. These new methods, which could include electronic submission of information equivalent to the information currently required under this Code, will be deemed to satisfy the reporting obligations under this Code. 
 (I) Disclaimers. 
 Any report required by this Section V may contain a statement that the report will not be construed as an admission that the person making the report has any direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership in the Covered Security to which the report relates. 
 Section VI Additional Prohibitions 
 (A) Confidentiality of the Corporation s Transactions. 
 Until disclosed in a public report to stockholders or to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC in the normal course, all information concerning the securities being considered for purchase or sale by the Corporation shall be kept confidential by all Access Persons and disclosed by them only on a need to know basis. It shall be the responsibility of the Chief Compliance Officer to report any inadequacy found in this regard to the directors of the Corporation. 
 (B) Insider Trading. 
 (1) Clearance of Transactions. The Corporation requires that all purchases and sales of Corporation securities by Access Persons (and their respective immediate family members) be cleared by the Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee prior to placing any order related to such transactions. Currently, the only Corporation securities available for purchase is the common stock of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. traded on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol GBDC Shares ). 
 (2) Window Period. After receiving clearance from the Chief Compliance Officer of the Corporation, Access Persons may purchase or sell Shares only during a designated window period. Should the end of the window period fall on a weekend, such window will be extended through close of business on the following business day. The window period may be extended at the discretion of the Corporation s board. Significantly, however, even during a window period, Access Persons may not 

Exhibit 14.1 

 engage in transactions involving Shares if such person is in possession of material, nonpublic information on the trade date. 
 (3) Avoidance of Speculative Transactions. Certain types of transactions as well as the timing of trading may raise an inference of the improper use of inside information. In order to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, the Corporation discourages trades by Access Persons that are of a short-term, speculative nature rather than for investment purposes. 
 (4) Limited Disclosure. Access Persons who have access to material information regarding the Corporation or its operations should exercise the utmost caution in preserving the confidentiality of that information. If anyone becomes aware of a leak of material information, whether inadvertent or otherwise, such person should report such leak immediately to the Chief Compliance Officer. Any insider who leaks inside information to a tippee may be equally liable with the tippee to third parties for any profit of the tippee. Of course, it will be necessary from time to time, for legitimate business reasons, to disclose material information to persons outside of the Corporation. Such persons might include commercial bankers, investment bankers or other companies with whom the Corporation may be pursuing a joint project. In such situations, material nonpublic information should not be conveyed until an express understanding, typically in the form of the Corporation s standard nondisclosure agreement, or NDA, has been reached that such information may not be used for trading purposes and may not be further disclosed other than for legitimate business reasons. Please contact the Chief Compliance Officer before disclosing any material non-public information regarding the Corporation to a third party or entering into an NDA.

 Exhibit 14.2 

GC ADVISORS LLC 
 CODE OF ETHICS 
 General 
 
 This Code of Ethics for the Adviser supplements (i) the Joint Code of Ethics for Golub Capital BDC, Inc., Golub Capital BDC 4, Inc., Golub Capital Direct Lending Corporation, Golub Capital Direct Lending Unlevered Corporation, Golub Capital Private Credit Fund, GC Advisors LLC and GC OPAL Advisors LLC that is applicable in connection with Golub Capital BDC, Inc., Golub Capital BDC 4, Inc., Golub Capital Direct Lending Corporation, Golub Capital Direct Lending Unlevered Corporation and Golub Capital Private Credit Fund and (ii) the policies and procedures contained in the Compliance Manual for the Adviser. 
 The Code of Ethics is predicated on the principle that the Adviser owes a fiduciary duty to its Clients. Accordingly, the Adviser s employees must avoid activities, interests and relationships that run contrary (or appear to run contrary) to the best interests of its Clients. At all times, Adviser employees must 
 Place Client interests ahead of the Adviser s interests As a fiduciary, the Adviser must serve its Clients best interests. In other words, Adviser employees may not benefit at the expense of the Clients. This concept is particularly relevant when employees are making personal investments in securities traded by the Adviser s Clients. 
 Engage in personal investing that is in full compliance with the Adviser s Code of Ethics Employees must review and abide by the Adviser s personal securities transaction and insider trading policies. 
 Avoid taking advantage of the employee s position Employees must not accept investment opportunities, gifts or other gratuities from individuals seeking to conduct business with the Adviser, or on behalf of a Client, where such opportunities, gifts or gratuities could create the appearance of impropriety or might otherwise influence a decision to conduct business with such other party. 
 Maintain full compliance with the federal securities laws It is the Adviser s policy that all employees must abide by the standards set forth in Rule 204A-1 (the Code of Ethics Rule for registered investment advisers under the Advisers Act. 
 Any questions with respect to the Adviser s Code of Ethics should be directed to the Chief Compliance Officer. As discussed in greater detail below, employees must promptly report any violations of the Code of Ethics to the Chief Compliance Officer. All reported Code of Ethics violations will be treated as being made on an anonymous basis. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 Guiding Principles & Standards of Conduct 
 All employees and members of the Adviser, and consultants closely associated with the Adviser, will act with competence, dignity and integrity, in an ethical manner, when dealing with Clients, the public, prospects, third-party service providers and fellow employees.

 I. PERSONAL SECURITIES TRANSACTION POLICY 
 Employees may freely trade in Permitted Securities (as defined below). If an employee wishes to trade in Reportable Securities (as defined below), such employee must obtain pre-clearance according to the Personal Securities Transaction Policy set forth below. 
 Permitted Securities 
 Government securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and similar money market instruments, exchange-traded funds and closed-end funds, mutual funds e.g. , open ended investment companies), variable annuities, transactions in managed accounts e.g., accounts where a 3 rd party manager has full trading authority) are Permitted Securities Permitted Securities and as such, are not required to be pre-cleared by employees under the Personal Securities Transaction Policy. Transactions in such securities are, however, subject to the 30-day recommended holding period described below. Employees may, if eligible to do so, invest in private funds run by others (a Third-Party Fund without receiving pre-clearance, but such 

Exhibit 14.2 

 investment remains subject to all of the policies and procedures in this Manual including the reporting provisions contained herein. 
 Reportable Securities 
 The Adviser will regard the following as reportable securities Reportable Securities for purposes of complying with this policy any note, stock, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any options on reportable securities, or in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a security that is not a Permitted Security. 
 Non-Securities 
 Commodities (and futures and options on commodities) that are traded on a commodities exchange, including currency futures are generally not considered securities and do not need to be reported. 
 Pre-Clearance Procedures 
 The Adviser s employees must have written clearance for any personal securities transaction (except for any transaction involving a Permitted Security or Third-Party Fund) before completing the transaction . Employees may request pre-clearance through the means then-propagated by the Chief Compliance Officer of the firm, and such means may change from time to time. 
 If pre-clearance is granted, the pre-clearance approval is generally valid only for the trading day on which the approval is granted except that if the approval is granted after 4 p.m. Eastern Time (e.g., New York City time), the approval extends to 4 p.m. Eastern Time (e.g., New York City time) the following business day. 
 Short Term Trading Adverse Trading 
 Adviser employees are encouraged to refrain from engaging in short-term (e.g., holding periods under 30 days) personal trading. Repeated short-term trading may subject the employee to sanctions by the Adviser. Except for limited circumstances and subject to disclosure and pre-clearance approval, Adviser employees should not execute trades opposite of positions the Adviser takes on behalf of its clients. 
 Beneficial Ownership 
 Employees are considered to have beneficial ownership of securities Beneficial Ownership if they have or share a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the securities. Employees have a pecuniary interest in securities if they have the ability to directly or indirectly profit from a securities transaction. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 The following are examples of indirect pecuniary interests in securities 
 Securities held by members of employees immediate family sharing the same household. Immediate family means any relative, spouse or significant other, or relative of the spouse or significant other of an employee 
 An employee s interest as a general partner in securities held by a general or limited partnership and 
 An employee s interest as a manager member in the securities held by a limited liability company. 
 Employees do not have an indirect pecuniary interest in securities held by entities in which they hold an equity interest unless they are a controlling equity holder or they share investment control over the securities held by the entity. 
 The following circumstances constitute beneficial ownership by employees of securities held by a trust 
 Legal ownership of securities as a trustee by an employee or members of the employees immediate family 
 Ownership of a vested beneficial interest in a trust by an employee or members of the employees immediate family and 
 An employee s status as a settlor of a trust, unless the consent of all of the beneficiaries is required in order for the employee to revoke the trust. 
 Restricted Securities 
 Anytime an employee receives material non-public information (as described in Part II, below) about a company that has issued publicly traded securities (a Public Company ), that company will be added to the Adviser s Restricted Securities List. Employees will be responsible for contacting the compliance golubcapital.com any time that they receive or intend to receive any non-public information about a Public Company. 
 A copy of all executed confidentiality agreements concerning a Public Company must be brought to the attention of the Chief Compliance Officer. Once an authorized signatory for the Adviser has signed a confidentiality agreement for the purpose of receiving non-public information about a Public Company, the company may be placed on the Restricted Securities List if the non-public information received about the Public Company is material. 
 Employees are responsible for notifying the Chief Compliance Officer of any other circumstances in which they or the firm should be restricted pursuant to this Code of Ethics. 
 Employees may not trade securities in a Public Company on the Restricted Securities List, including but not limited to, trading in an Employee s personal account or on behalf of a 

Exhibit 14.2 

 Client account without receiving pre-clearance from the Compliance Department. Investment professionals should consider the fact that they will be restricted from trading the public securities of a Public Company for which any employee has received non-public information when evaluating any potential hedging strategies for positions. Employees may be unable to liquidate personal or Client holdings of securities that are subsequently added to the Restricted Securities List. 
 Unless the Chief Compliance sets up ethical walls, all employees, whether investment professionals or non-investment professionals, will be regarded as having access to any non-public information about a Public Company that has been received by any other employee. 
 The Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee will periodically review each Public Company on the Restricted Securities List to determine whether any employees remain in possession of non-public information. Additionally, a Public Company can be removed from the Restricted List by the Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee at other times if it can be determined that no employee remains in possession of non-public information, and no employee has any intention of obtaining such information. 
 Investments in Private Company Securities and Initial Public Offerings 
 Employees may not acquire, directly or indirectly, any Beneficial Ownership in any limited offering or initial public offering IPO without first obtaining prior approval of the Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee in order to preclude any possibility of the employee profiting improperly from such employee s position with the Adviser. The Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee shall (1) obtain from the employee full details of the proposed transaction (including written certification that the investment opportunity did not arise by virtue of the employee s activities on behalf of a Client) and (2) conclude, after consultation with a portfolio manager (who has no personal interest in the issuer of the limited offering or IPO), that no Clients have any foreseeable interest in purchasing such security. A record of such approval and the reasons supporting those decisions shall be kept as required in the Records section of this Policy. 
 Reporting 
 In order to provide the Adviser with information to enable it to determine with reasonable assurance any indications of front-running or the appearance of a conflict of interest with the trading by any Client account, each Adviser employee must submit a report to the Chief Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer s designee showing all transactions in which the person has, or by reason of such transaction acquires, any direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership except for exempt transactions listed in the section below entitled Exemptions from Reporting Requirements. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 Transaction Reports 
 Employees are required to (i) instruct their broker-dealers to send to the Adviser duplicate broker-dealer trade confirmations and account statements which must be received by the Chief Compliance Officer, at a minimum, no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter and or (ii) complete such paperwork as is required by the Chief Compliance Officer so that such information may be provided electronically to the firm. If an employee s trades do not occur through a broker-dealer (e.g., purchase of a private investment fund), such transactions shall be reported separately on the quarterly personal securities transaction report. The quarterly transaction reports shall contain at least the following information for each transaction in a Reportable Security in which the employee had, or as a result of the transaction acquired, any direct or indirect beneficial ownership (a) the date of the transaction, the title, and as applicable the exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, the interest rate and maturity date (if applicable), the number of shares and the principal amount of each Reportable Security involved (b) the nature of the transaction (e.g., purchase, sale or any other type of acquisition or disposition) (c) the price of the Reportable Security at which the transaction was effected (d) the name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through which the transaction was effected and (e) the date that the report is submitted. Employees are reminded that they must also report transactions by members of the employee s immediate family including spouse, children and other members of the household in accounts over which the employee has direct or indirect influence or control. If an employee has arranged to have monthly brokerage statements delivered to the Chief Compliance Officer, directly or electronically, then quarterly transaction reports are not required. 
 Initial and Annual Holdings Reports 
 New Adviser employees will be required to report all of their personal securities holdings not later than 10 days after the commencement of their employment. The initial holdings report must be current as of a date not more than 45 days prior to the date the person becomes an employee. 
 Existing employees are required to certify to the Adviser on an annual basis that the Adviser has a complete list of the Adviser s holdings. 
 Each holdings report (both the initial and annual) must contain, at a minimum (a) the title and type of security, and as applicable the exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, number of shares, and principal amount of each reportable security in which the employee has any direct or indirect beneficial ownership (b) the name of any broker, dealer or bank with which the employee maintains an account in which any securities are held for the employee s direct or indirect benefit and (c) the date the employee submits the report. 
 Duplicate Copies 
 In order to help ensure that duplicate brokerage confirmations are received for all accounts pertaining to a particular employee, such employee must complete and send a brokerage letter to each bank, broker or dealer maintaining an account on behalf of the employee if requested by the Chief Compliance Officer. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 Exceptions from Reporting Requirement 
 Employees are not required to submit (1) a transaction or initial and annual holdings report with respect to securities held in accounts over which the access person had no direct or indirect influence or control, or (2) a transaction report with respect to transactions effected pursuant to an automatic investment plan. 
 New Account Report 
 A report shall be completed by an employee, when applicable, to disclose the name of any new account established by the employee during the quarter in which any securities, including Permitted Securities, were held for the direct or indirect benefit of the employee and include (a) the name of the broker, dealer or bank with whom the employee established the account (b) the date the account was established and (c) the date that the report is submitted by the employee. 
 Review 
 The Adviser strictly forbids front-running Client accounts, which is a practice generally understood to be employees personally trading ahead of Client accounts. The Chief Compliance Officer will closely monitor employees investment patterns to detect these abuses. The Adviser s members will monitor the Chief Compliance Officer s personal securities transactions for compliance with the Personal Securities Transaction Policy. 
 The reason for the development of a post-transaction review process is to ensure that the Adviser has developed procedures to supervise the activities of its access persons. The comparison of employee trades to those of Clients will identify potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of a potential conflict. 
 If the Adviser discovers that an employee is personally trading contrary to the policies set forth above, the employee shall meet with the Chief Compliance Officer and the Adviser s members to review the facts surrounding the transactions. This meeting shall help the Adviser to determine the appropriate course of action. 
 Remedial Actions 
 The Adviser takes the potential for conflicts of interest caused by personal investing very seriously. Employees should be aware that the Adviser reserves the right to impose varied sanctions on policy violators depending on the severity of the policy violation, including termination of employment. 
 II. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO DETECT AND PREVENT INSIDER TRADING 
 The Adviser s business may require employees to deal with confidential information. The proper handling of material, non-public information is critical to the Adviser s integrity. The Adviser s reputation is a vital asset and even the appearance of the misuse of material, non-public information should be avoided. The misuse of non-public information may violate federal 

Exhibit 14.2 

 and state securities laws and other legal and regulatory requirements. Violations may be damaging to both the reputation and financial position of the Adviser and its employees. 
 The Adviser forbids trading, either for oneself or for others, on material, non-public information or communicating material, non-public information to others in violation of the law. This conduct is frequently called insider trading. The Adviser s policy extends to activities within and outside one s relationship with the Adviser. Individuals who cease to work for the Adviser must continue to maintain the confidentiality of inside and proprietary information learned during their employment. 
 Although insider trading is not defined in securities laws, it is generally thought to be described as trading either personally or on behalf of others on the basis of material non-public information or communicating material non-public information to others in violation of the law. 
 In the past, securities laws have been interpreted to prohibit the following activities 
 Trading by an insider while in possession of material non-public information 
 Trading by a non-insider while in possession of material non-public information, where the information was disclosed to the non-insider in violation of an insider s duty to keep it confidential or 
 Communicating material non-public information to others in breach of a fiduciary duty. 
 Whom Does the Policy Cover 
 This policy covers all of the Adviser s employees covered persons as well as any transactions in any securities participated in by family members, trusts or corporations directly or indirectly controlled by such persons. In addition, the policy applies to transactions engaged in by corporations in which the covered person is an officer, director or 10 or greater stockholder and a partnership of which the covered person is a partner unless the covered person has no direct or indirect control over the partnership. If any employee has questions about whom this policy covers, such employee should consult the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 What Information is Material 
 Information is material when there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making investment decisions. Generally, this is information whose disclosure will have a substantial effect on the price of a company s securities. No simple bright line test exists to determine whether information is material assessments of materiality involve highly fact specific inquiries. Adviser employees should direct any questions regarding the materiality of information to the Chief Compliance Officer. The following is an illustrative list of the type of information that is generally regarded as material 
 Information relating to a company s results and operations 
 Dividend or earnings announcements 

Exhibit 14.2 

 Write-downs or write-offs of assets 
 Additions to reserves for bad debts or contingent liabilities 
 Expansion or curtailment of company or major division operations 
 Merger, joint venture announcements 
 New product service announcements 
 Discovery or research developments 
 Criminal, civil and government investigations and indictments 
 Pending labor disputes 
 Debt service or liquidity problems 
 Bankruptcy or insolvency problems 
 Tender offers, stock repurchase plans, etc. 
 Recapitalization 
 Information provided by a company could be material because of its expected effect on a particular class of a company s securities, all of the company s securities, the securities of another company, or the securities of several companies. The misuse of material non-public information applies to all types of securities, including equity, debt, commercial paper, government securities and options. 
 Material information does not have to relate to a company s business. For example, material information about the contents of an upcoming newspaper column may affect the price of a security and therefore be considered material. Material information may also relate to the market for a security. Information about a significant order to purchase or sell securities, in some contexts, may be deemed material similarly, prepublication information regarding reports in the financial press may also be deemed material. 
 What Information is Non-Public 
 In order for issues concerning insider trading to arise, information must not only be material, but also non-public. Non-public information generally means information that has not been available to the investing public. 
 Once material, non-public information has been effectively distributed to the investing public, it is no longer classified as material, non-public information. However, the distribution of non-public information must occur through commonly recognized channels for the classification to change. In addition, the information must not only be publicly disclosed, there 

Exhibit 14.2 

 must be adequate time for the public to receive and digest the information. Lastly, non-public information does not change to public information solely by selective dissemination. 
 The Adviser s employees must be aware that even where there is no expectation of confidentiality, a person may become an insider upon receiving material, non-public information. Whether the tip made to the employee makes such employee a tippee depends on whether the corporate insider expects to benefit personally, either directly or indirectly, from the disclosure. 
 The benefit is not limited to a present or future monetary gain it could be a reputational benefit or an expectation of a quid pro quo from the recipient by a gift of the information. Employees may also become insiders or tippees if they obtain material, non-public information by happenstance, at social gatherings, by overhearing conversations, etc. 
 Penalties for Trading on Insider Information 
 Severe penalties exist for firms and individuals that engage in the act of insider trading, including civil injunctions, treble damages, disgorgement of profits and jail sentences. Further, fines for individuals and firms found guilty of insider trading are levied in amounts up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided, and up to the greater of 1,000,000 or three times the profit gained or loss avoided, respectively. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 Procedures to Follow if an Employee Believes That Such Employee Possesses Material, Non-Public Information 
 The Adviser has established the following procedures to help each employee avoid insider trading and to aid the Adviser in preventing, detecting and imposing sanctions against insider trading. Each employee must follow these procedures or risk serious sanctions, including dismissal, substantial personal liability and criminal penalties. If any employee has questions about these procedures, such employee should consult the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 If an employee has questions as to whether such employee is in possession of material, non-public information, the employee must inform the Chief Compliance Officer as soon as possible. From this point, the employee, the Chief Compliance Officer and the Adviser s members will conduct research to determine if the information is likely to be considered important to investors in making investment decisions and whether the information has been publicly disseminated. 
 Given the severe penalties imposed on individuals and firms engaging in insider trading, an Adviser employee 
 shall not trade the securities of any company in which such employee is deemed an insider who may possess material, non-public information about the company 
 shall not trade the securities of any company except in accordance with the Adviser s Personal Securities Transaction Policy and the securities laws 
 shall submit personal security trading reports in accordance with the Personal Security Transaction Policy 
 shall not discuss any potentially material, non-public information with colleagues, except as specifically required by such employee s position 
 shall immediately report the potential receipt of non-public information to the Chief Compliance Officer and the Adviser s members and 
 shall not proceed with any research, trading or other investment advisory activities until the Chief Compliance Officer and the Adviser s members inform the employee of the appropriate course of action. 
 III. DIRECTORSHIPS OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES 
 Serving as Officers, Trustees and or Directors of Outside Organizations 
 Employees may, under certain circumstances, be granted permission to serve as directors, trustees or officers of outside organizations. These organizations can include public or private corporations, partnerships, charitable foundations and other not-for-profit institutions. Employees may also receive compensation for such activities. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 At certain times, the Adviser may determine that it is in its Clients best interests for an employee to serve as an officer or on the board of directors of outside organizations. For example, a company held in Clients portfolios may be undergoing a reorganization that may affect the value of the company s outstanding securities and the future direction of the company. Service with organizations outside of the Adviser can, however, raise serious regulatory issues and concerns, including conflicts of interests and access to material non-public information. 
 As an outside board member or officer, an employee may come into possession of material non-public information about the outside company or other public companies. It is critical that a proper information barrier be in place between the Adviser and the outside organization and that the employee not communicate such information to other Adviser employees in violation of the information barrier. 
 Similarly, the Adviser may have a business relationship with the outside organization or may seek a relationship in the future. In those circumstances, the employee should not be involved in the decision to retain or hire the Adviser. 
 Adviser employees are prohibited from engaging in such outside activities without the prior written approval from the Chief Compliance Officer. Approval will be granted on a case-by-case basis, subject to proper resolution of potential conflicts of interest. Outside activities will be approved only if any conflict of interest issues can be satisfactorily resolved. 
 Outside Business Activities 
 Adviser personnel generally may not be employed (either on a part-time, evening or weekend basis) or compensated by any business other than the Adviser or one of its affiliates. 
 Approval of the Chief Compliance Officer for any of the above activities must be obtained prior to engaging in such activity so that determinations may be made regarding (1) the degree to which such activity may interfere with the employee s duties to the Adviser and the Clients and (2) whether such activity involves conflicts of interest between the Adviser and any Client that need to be disclosed and may require Client and or Fund Investor consent. 
 IV. RUMORS MANIPULATIVE TRADING PRACTICES 
 A. Rumors 
 Supervised Persons are prohibited from circulating false rumors and rumors of a sensational character that reasonably may be expected to affect market conditions for one or more securities, sectors or markets, or improperly influencing any person or entity. Intentionally creating, passing or using false rumors may violate the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws, and such conduct is contradictory to this Code of Ethics and the Adviser s expectations regarding appropriate behavior of its Supervised Persons. 
 A Supervised Person should consult with the Chief Compliance Officer if such Supervised Person has questions regarding the appropriateness of any communications. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 B. Manipulative Trading Practices 
 Section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder make it unlawful for any person, acting alone or with others, to trade any security in order to create actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raise or depress the price of the security. 
 Supervised Persons are prohibited from engaging in actual or apparent trading in a security for the purpose of (a) inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others or (b) causing the price of a security to move up or down. The Exchange Act does not prohibit otherwise lawful activity that has the incidental result of changing the supply or demand or the intrinsic value of a security. 
 V. POLITICAL CONTRIBUTION POLICY 
 Pay-to-play is the practice of making campaign contributions and related payments to elected officials in order to influence the awarding of lucrative contracts for the management of public pension plan assets and similar government investment accounts. The SEC has adopted measures to curtail pay-to-play practices by registered investment advisers. The Adviser prohibits any Supervised Person from making a political contribution to gain, or to attempt to gain, an engagement for the Adviser or any affiliate. 
 The Adviser also prohibits any Supervised Person from making any political contributions without prior written approval as outlined in the policy statement below 
 This policy statement is necessary to comply with laws, regulations and governmental policies relating to political contributions to public officials and candidates by investment managers, their employees and certain related parties described below, or relating to their solicitation or coordination of political contributions. For this purpose, a political contribution includes any gift, loan, deposit, transition or inaugural expense, or anything of value other than unpaid volunteer time, or any indirect contributions directed, funded or solicited through third parties. 
 This policy statement covers any owner, director, officer, employee or agent of Golub Capital, any of their household members, or any political action committee or other entity that they control. It prohibits any such person or entity covered by this policy statement from making a contribution to anyone who is, or who is campaigning to become, a state, local or public retirement plan official, without first notifying Golub Capital and receiving prior approval from Compliance. A candidate for federal office that is currently a state, local or retirement plan official would be subject to this restriction. Prior notice and approval are also required prior to the solicitation or coordination of political contributions for anyone who is, or who is campaigning to become, a state, local or public retirement plan official, or for state or local political parties. 
 The purpose of this policy statement is not to unnecessarily limit political contributions and activities, but to comply with applicable laws, regulations and 

Exhibit 14.2 

 governmental policies applicable to Golub Capital, including changes that might occur in the law. Therefore, Golub Capital will normally approve political contributions and activities that comply with applicable laws, regulations and governmental policies, do not impose a material risk to Golub Capital in light of possible changes that might occur and do not otherwise impose a material risk to the business or reputation of Golub Capital. For example, under current rules, Golub Capital will normally approve contributions outside the State of New York by persons who are not in management or fundraising roles or who make contributions under certain dollar thresholds. Golub Capital also will normally approve contributions in the State of New York under certain dollar thresholds by persons entitled to vote for the office involved. Similarly, Golub Capital will normally approve contributions involving governmental offices that are not involved in the management of assets or the selection of investment managers, and that are not in a position to appoint or otherwise influence such officials. In all events, however, Golub Capital may be required to keep records of contributions and solicitation and coordination activities of persons and entities covered by this policy statement, and to disclose those records to its governmental regulators. 
 This policy statement may change as laws, regulations and governmental policies change. This policy statement is in addition to, and does not replace, other policies of Golub Capital with respect to complying with laws and maintaining the highest level of integrity concerning Golub Capital s dealings with its Investors, including but not limited to Investors that represent state, municipal and retirement plan assets. 
 VI. PROVIDING INVESTMENT ADVICE TO PERSONS OTHER THAN ADVISER CLIENTS DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INTEREST IN TRANSACTIONS 
 To avoid conflicts with the interests of Clients, no Supervised Person may provide investment advice (e.g., advice as to the value of securities, or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities) or portfolio management services for compensation to any person, other than a Client, under any circumstances, unless that arrangement is disclosed to and approved by the Chief Compliance Officer. Such investment advice would be considered an outside business activity and should be reported as such. It is a conflict of interest to recommend any security to a Client, or to direct any transaction for a Client in that security, if a Supervised Person has a personal interest in that security. Therefore, if a Supervised Person has a personal interest in a security (other than an interest in a Fund), such Supervised Person must disclose that interest to the Chief Compliance Officer before recommending that security or before directing an investment decision with respect to that security. If a Supervised Person has the power to direct any transaction in any such security, investment personnel with no personal interest in such security must review such an investment decision. A personal interest in a security may be financial, but it may also involve another interest, such as a family or friend s involvement with a security. This shall not, however, prohibit a Supervised Person from making investment decisions for such Supervised Person s own account, subject to the Code of Ethics. 

Exhibit 14.2 

 VII. GIFTS 
 Receiving Excessive Gifts or Entertainment is Prohibited 
 Receiving excessive gifts or entertainment from others who may represent actual or potential vendors is prohibited. Supervised Persons may accept only business-related meals, entertainment, gifts, or favors when the value involved is not significant and clearly will not create any appearance of a conflict of interest or an obligation to the donor. The value of a gift or favor should be less than 100 and may not be part of a recurrent pattern of giving. Each Supervised Person may accept gifts from a single giver (any firm or natural person associated with such firm) in amounts not exceeding 100 in any year. Such prohibition does not limit ordinary and usual business entertainment provided by a firm or its associates to Supervised Persons. Thus, when a firm or its associates are hosting Supervised Persons at an occasional meal, sporting event, theater production or comparable entertainment event, such an event would not be subject to the 100 gift restriction so long as it is neither so frequent nor so extensive as to raise any question of propriety. 
 Approval Required for Receipt of Gifts in Excess of 100 
 Before accepting anything with an assumed individual or aggregate value (except for those items of business entertainment noted directly above) from any outside business person in excess of 100 during any year, a Supervised Person must obtain the written approval of the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 Providing Excessive Gifts or Entertainment is Prohibited 
 Providing excessive gifts or entertainment to others who may represent actual or prospective clients is also prohibited. Giving extravagant gifts or entertainment to the fiduciary of an account can be construed as an inducement to such fiduciary to allocate client assets on a basis other than the suitability of the manager. Further, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA and many state laws (with respect to state plans) prohibit such gifts. 
 In any case, no gifts or entertainment of any value should be given with respect to any ERISA or Taft-Hartley benefit plan investor, state or municipal pension plans or state or local elected officials without prior approval of the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 Supervised Persons may give only business-related meals, entertainment, gifts or favors when the value involved is not significant and clearly will not create any appearance of a conflict of interest or an obligation to the donor. The value of a gift or favor should be less than 250 and may not be part of a recurrent pattern of giving. Each Supervised Person may give gifts to a single receiver (any firm or natural person associated with such firm) in amounts not exceeding 250 in any year. Such prohibition does not limit ordinary and usual business entertainment provided to a firm or its associates. Thus, when a firm or its associates are hosted by Supervised Persons at an occasional meal, sporting event, theater production or comparable entertainment 

Exhibit 14.2 

 event, such an event would not be subject to the 250 gift restriction so long as it is neither so frequent nor so extensive as to raise any question of propriety. 
 Approval Required for Providing Gifts in Excess of 250 
 Before giving anything with an assumed individual or aggregate value (except for those items of business entertainment noted directly above) to any outside business person in excess of 250 during any year, a Supervised Person must obtain the approval of the Chief Compliance Officer. 
 Under no circumstances may an employee initiate or encourage the provision of a gift from any other person or organization. For the avoidance of doubt, this policy regarding gifts also applies to interactions with government entities and employees. 
 Relationships with Outside Vendors 
 Supervised Persons should be careful when doing business on behalf of the Adviser with outside vendors Vendors with which a Supervised Person has a financial interest or family or personal relationship. These situations may present conflicts of interest that impair the Supervised Person from acting solely in the best interests of the Adviser and its Clients and without regard to the financial interest or family or personal relationship. When a Supervised Person learns that the Adviser is, or is considering, doing business with a Vendor with which that or another employee has a financial, family or personal relationship, the Supervised Person should disclose that information promptly to the Chief Compliance Officer. While there is no absolute prohibition against holding a financial interest in or having a family or personal relationship with a Vendor, the Adviser will examine these situations, before the relationship with the Adviser begins to the extent practicable, so that the Adviser can evaluate any potential conflicts of interest. 
 In evaluating these situations, a conflict of interest will be presumed to exist when an employee who has a financial, family or personal relationship with a Vendor approves the use of the Vendor or negotiates the terms of the agreement with the Vendor. Certain mitigating facts can overcome this presumption. Factors that will be considered include the significance of the financial interest, the degree of the family or personal relationship and whether the fairness of the price of the goods or services can be determined independently. 
 VIII. DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
 Any Supervised Person who becomes aware of any practice that arguably involves the Adviser in a conflict of interest and is not sure whether the practice has been fully and accurately disclosed to Clients and or Investors or whether Clients and or Investors have consented to the practice should promptly contact the Chief Compliance Officer. In assisting the Chief Compliance Officer in formulating appropriate disclosures, Supervised Persons must bear in mind that the Adviser will not be deemed to have properly obtained consent from a particular Client or Investor unless the disclosure relating to the conflict is materially accurate and complete and understandable by that particular Client or Investor.
