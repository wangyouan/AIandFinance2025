CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains, in addition to historical information, certain forward-looking statements about our expectations,
beliefs or intentions regarding, among other things, our business, financial results, strategies or prospects. You can identify forward-looking
statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements
relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements
relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our
actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could
cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results described in forward-looking statements.
These factors include those set forth below as well as those contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). We do not undertake any obligation
to update forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements reflect our views only as
of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance. 

Risks
and uncertainties, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, include the following: 

We
 have a history of operating losses, we do not expect to become profitable in the near future and absent additional equity or debt
 financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. 

We
 will require additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 

We
 do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 

Because
 our common stock is a penny stock, it may be more difficult for investors to sell shares of our Common Stock, and the
 market price of our common stock may be adversely affected. 

Our
 stock price has been volatile and there may not be an active, liquid trading market for our common stock. 

Our
 quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. 

Shareholders
 may experience dilution of ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred
 stock.

PART
I 

Item
1. Business. 

General 

Non-Invasive
Monitoring Systems, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company, NIMS, we, 
 us or our was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on July 16, 1980. The Company s
offices are located at 4400 Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida, 33137 and its telephone number is (305) 575-4200. 

Company
Overview 

Our
primary business previously consisted of research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of non-invasive, motorized, whole
body periodic acceleration WBPA platforms. These therapeutic acceleration platforms are intended as aids to temporarily
increase local circulation for temporary relief of minor aches and pains, produce local muscle relaxation and reduce morning stiffness. 

In
May 2019, we effectively discontinued operations. The Company is a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

Products 

We
currently have no inventory and do not have any of our products available for sale. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Our
future operating results may vary substantially from anticipated results due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
The following discussion highlights some of these factors and the possible impact of these factors on our future results of operations.
If any of the following events actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed.
In that case, the value of our common stock could decline substantially. 

Risks
Relating to Our Business. 

We
have a history of operating losses, we do not expect to become profitable in the near future and absent additional equity or debt financing,
we may be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Our
consolidated financial statements for the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 were prepared on a going concern basis; however
substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of recurring losses and an accumulated deficit.
We are not profitable and have been incurring material losses. Our net losses for our fiscal years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 were
 113,000 and 199,000 respectively. As of July 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 29.0 million. The Company had 25,000 of cash
at July 31, 2024 and negative working capital of approximately 127,000. Absent additional equity or debt financing, we will be unable
to continue as a going concern, and you may lose all your investment in us. 

We
will require additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 

We
will need to raise additional capital in order for us to continue as a going concern. We will need to finance future cash needs primarily
through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, mergers or acquisitions. We do not know whether additional funding will
be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We cannot assure you that we could obtain such approval. To the extent that we raise additional
funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience significant dilution, and debt financing, if available, may require
that we agree to covenants that restrict our operations. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing
arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our products or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. 

4 

We
may be exposed to risks relating to management s assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over
financial reporting. 

If
we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could
be impaired. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these material weaknesses
will be effectively remediated, or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. 

We
are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other
things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal
control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls
and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered
in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. 

Furthermore,
we cannot be certain that our efforts will be sufficient to remediate current or prevent future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies
from occurring. 

The
internal control procedures over the completeness and accuracy of the general ledger information and the risk assessment process are
not formally documented and may not be designed and operate with a level of precision adequate to prevent or detect misstatements. 

Risks
Relating to Corporate Governance 

Because
we do not currently have an audit or compensation committee made up of independent directors, shareholders will have to rely on our directors,
only one of whom is independent, to perform these functions. 

Currently,
we do not have an independent audit committee. Our one independent director along with the other Directors functions as our audit committee
and is comprised of four directors, three of whom are not considered to be independent in accordance with the requirements
of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance
process, assessment of the Company s processes relating to its risks and control environment, oversight of financial reporting,
and evaluation of internal and independent audit processes. The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the Board of Directors
from being independent in its judgments and its ability to pursue the committee s responsibilities, this could compromise management
of our business. 

We
do not have a functioning compensation committee comprised of independent directors. The Board of Directors performs these functions
as a whole. Thus, there is a potential conflict in that board members who are also part of management will participate in discussions
concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. 

5 

Risks
Relating to Our Stock. 

We
do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 

We
have not declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock in the past, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future. We intend to retain all of our earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion
of our business. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common
stock increases and you sell your shares. 

Because
our common stock is a penny stock, it may be more difficult for investors to sell shares of our common stock, and the market
price of our common stock may be adversely affected. 

Our
common stock, which trades on the OTC PINK, is a penny stock since, among other things, the stock price is below 5.00
per share, it is not listed on a national securities exchange, and it has not met certain net tangible asset or average revenue requirements.
Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk-disclosure document prepared by
the SEC. This document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the penny-stock
market. A broker must also give a purchaser, orally or in writing, bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson
compensation, make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and obtain the purchaser s
written agreement to the purchase. Broker-dealers must also provide customers that hold penny stock in their accounts with such broker-dealer
a monthly statement containing price and market information relating to the penny stock. If a penny stock is sold to an investor in violation
of the penny stock rules, the investor may be able to cancel its purchase and get its money back. 

If
applicable, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares of our common stock. Because of the rules
and restrictions applicable to a penny stock, there is less trading in penny stocks and the market price of our common stock may be adversely
affected. Also, many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions. Accordingly, investors may not always be able to
resell their shares of our common stock publicly at times and prices acceptable to them. 

Our
stock price has been volatile and there may not be an active, liquid trading market for our common stock. 

Our
stock price has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and may continue to experience volatility in the future. The price
of our common stock has ranged between 0.00 and 0.04 for the 52-week period ended July 31, 2024. Many factors, including those described
in this report and others, have a significant impact on the price of our common stock. Also, you may not be able to sell your shares
at the best market price if trading in our stock in not active or if the volume is low. There is no guarantee that an active trading
market for our common stock will be maintained on the OTC PINK or elsewhere. 

Our
quarterly results of operations may fluctuate, and these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. 

Our
quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. As a result, in some
future quarters our financial or operating results may not meet the expectations of potential securities analysts and investors which
could result in a decline in the price of our stock. 

6 

Shareholders
may experience dilution of ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred
stock. 

In
the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests
of our present shareholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 401,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of
400,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 designated shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights to be determined by
our Board of Directors. As of October 25, 2024, there were outstanding 154,810,655 shares of our common stock, 100 shares of our Series
B preferred stock and there were no outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock. We may also issue additional shares of
our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining
employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future
issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. We
may issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with capital raising efforts, including
at a price (or exercise price) below the price at which shares of our common stock are then currently traded on the OTC PINK.

None 

Item
1C. Cybersecurity 

We
are currently a shell company with no business operations. Since May 2019, we have been in search of a suitable merger or acquisition
candidate. Therefore, we do not consider that we face significant cybersecurity risk and have not adopted any cybersecurity risk management
program or formal processes for assessing cybersecurity risk. Our Board of Directors is generally responsible for the oversight of risks
from cybersecurity threats, if there is any. 

However,
the Company consistently evaluates risks from cybersecurity threats, monitors its information systems for potential vulnerabilities,
and tests these systems according to its cybersecurity policies, standards, processes, and practices. These measures are integrated into
the Company s overall risk management system to protect its information systems from cybersecurity threats. The Company also has
the option to engage a third-party contractor if a cyber threat arises. 

Item
2. Properties. 

Our
principal corporate office is located at 4400 Biscayne Blvd., Miami, Florida. We occupy this space from Frost Real Estate Holdings, LLC,
which is a company controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, a member of the Board of Directors and one of our largest beneficial shareholders.
We previously leased the approximately 1,800 square feet under a lease agreement, which commenced with a five-year term on January 1,
2008 and expired on December 31, 2012, and then we went on a month-to-month basis and then in February 2016 the office space rent was
reduced to 0 per month.

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains, in addition to historical information, certain forward-looking statements about our expectations,
beliefs or intentions regarding, among other things, our business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects.
You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters.
Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results as of the date they are made.
Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated
in forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth below as well as those contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors 
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable
law. These forward-looking statements reflect our views only as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial
performance. 

Overview 

We
previously were engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of non-invasive, whole body periodic acceleration WBPA therapeutic platforms, which are motorized platforms that move a subject repetitively head to foot. The Company discontinued operations
in May 2019, accordingly, certain assets, liabilities and expenses are classified as discontinued operations. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related
to income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. A more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting
policies can be found in Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K. While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting
policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise
of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates.

Results
of Operations 

We
have discontinued operations in May 2019. The Company is assessing potential mergers and acquisitions. 

Year
Ended July 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended July 31, 2023 

General
and administrative costs and expenses. General and administrative G A costs and expenses was 177,000 for the
year ended July 31, 2024, as compared to 169,000 for the year ended July 31, 2023. This 8,000 net increase was primarily associated
with professional fees incurred in the year ended July 31, 2024. 

An
accounts payable adjustment resulting in a reduction of 118,000 was made in the year ended July 31, 2024 (see Note 9). 

Total
operating costs and expenses. Total operating costs and expenses from continuing operations was 59,000 for the year ended July 31,
2024, as compared to 169,000 for the year ended July 31, 2023. This 110,000 decrease was primarily due to a 118,000 accounts payable
adjustment (see Note 9) offset by a 8,000 increase in professional fees. 

Interest
expense. Net interest expense was 54,000 for the year ended July 31, 2024, as compared to 30,000 for the year ended July 31, 2023.
The interest expense is related to the Promissory Notes described in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Net
loss. Net loss was 113,000 for the year ended July 31, 2024, as compared to 199,000 for the year ended July 31, 2023. This 86,000
decrease was primarily attributable to a 118,000 accounts payable adjustment (see Note 9) offset by a 32,000 increase is primarily
attributable to interest expense and professional fees. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
operations have been primarily financed through private sales of our equity securities and notes received from related parties. 

At
July 31, 2024, we had cash of 25,000 and negative working capital of approximately 127,000. We expect that our existing funds will
not be sufficient to support our current operations over the next twelve months. No assurance can be given that such additional financing
will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to sell additional shares of our stock and/or borrow cash could be materially
adversely affected by the economic uncertainty in the global equity and credit markets. Current economic conditions have been, and continue
to be, volatile, and continued instability in these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to fund and
grow our business and to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities. 

Net
cash used in operating activities increased to 182,000 for the year ended July 31, 2024 as compared to 158,000 for the year ended July
31, 2023. This 24,000 increase was principally due to increases in cash used for accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

On
August 15, 2023, we entered into a Promissory Note in the principal amount of 200,000 with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the 2023

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1, the Company incurred a net loss and used cash in operations during the year ended July 31, 2024, and the Company had a shareholders 
deficit as of that date. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the
current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

from operating activities. The Company also has an accumulated deficit of million as of July 31, 2024. The Company had

ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company is seeking potential mergers, acquisitions and strategic collaborations. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful
in this regard, and, if not successful, that it will be able to continue its business activities. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Discontinued

current director and who is the beneficial owner of more than of the Company s common stock. The rental payments under the
Miami office lease, which commenced January 1, 2008 and expired on December 31, 2012, were approximately per month and then continued
on a month-to-month basis. In February 2016 the rent was reduced to per month. For the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company
did t record any rent expense related to the Miami lease. At July 31, 2024 and 2023 there was rent payable.

does not affect the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023. 

The
Company files its tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and with U.S. states. The Company is subject to tax audits in all jurisdictions
for which it files tax returns. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. There are
currently no tax audits that have commenced with respect to income tax or any other returns in any jurisdiction. Tax years ranging from
2020 to 2023 remain open to examination by various taxing jurisdictions as the statute of limitations has not expired. Because the Company
is carrying forward income tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits from earlier tax years, these attributes can
still be audited when utilized on returns filed in the future. It is the Company s policy to include income tax interest and penalties
expense in its tax provision. 

The
difference between income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate of in 2024 and 2023 and income taxes reported in the consolidated
statements of operations are attributable to the following (in thousands):

9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

Principal
Accountant 

On
November 27, 2023, the Board of Directors (the Board of Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. approved the engagement
of Weinberg Company P.A. Weinberg as the Company s new independent registered public accounting firm. In
connection with the selection of Weinberg, the Board dismissed EisnerAmper LLP EisnerAmper as the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm on November 27, 2023. 

There
were no disagreements between the Company and EisnerAmper on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure,
or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of EisnerAmper would have caused them to make
reference thereto in their reports on the Company s financial statements for such years. 

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

The
Company s management, with the participation of its Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of July 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of that date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness
identified below. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024,
the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

Process
and procedures The Company does not employ a sufficient number of individuals to maintain optimal segregation of duties. The
internal control procedures over the completeness and accuracy of the general ledger information and the risk assessment process are
not formally documented and may not be designed and operate with a level of precision adequate to prevent or detect misstatements. Since
internal control procedures are not formally documented, management cannot monitor their effectiveness. 

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company s internal controls. 

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

Notwithstanding
the existence of these material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, the Company s management
believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects the Company s
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the last quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Item
9B. Other Information. 

On October 23, 2024, the Company entered into a Promissory Note in the principal amount of 30,000.00 with Frost
Gamma Investments Trust (the October 2024 Frost Gamma Note ), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, which beneficially
owns in excess of 10 of NIMS common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on October 2024 Frost Gamma Note is 11 per annum,
payable on the Maturity Date. The October 2024 Frost Gamma Note may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty. 

The foregoing is only a brief summary of some of the terms of the October Frost Gamma Note and does not purport to
be complete. Please refer to the Frost Gamma Note, which is attached as Exhibit 10.103 for its full terms.
