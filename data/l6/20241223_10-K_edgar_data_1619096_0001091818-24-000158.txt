Results of Operations 

During the year ended September 30, 2024, we generated
 1,900 in passive revenues. We generated 1,900 in passive revenues during the period ending September 30, 2023. Our operating expenses
for the same periods were comprised of general and administrative expenses of 230,550 and 165,362, respectively, resulting in a net
loss of 216,150 the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net income of 23,778 the year ended September 30, 2023. Our general
and administrative expenses consisted of mainly professional fees for the year ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended September
30, 2023. The increase of general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the increase of salaries and wages, rent, and professional
fees. 

Our total assets as of September 30, 2024 were 2,679,796. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 88,711,657
shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were total
debts of 579,000 and 579,000 respectively, due to related parties. These debts are interest free, unsecured and payable on demand. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As for the year ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
the Company had a negative cash flow of 103,288 and positive cash flow of 140,785, respectively. The Company s principal sources and
uses of funds were as follows: 

For the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company
used 345,288 in cash for operations as compared to 59,305 for the year ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Such increase was
primarily due to higher net loss in the year ended September 30, 2024. The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended
September 30, 2024 was 242,000 as compared to 200,090 for the year ended September 30, 2023. Such increase was a result of capital raised
from the issuance of common shares. 

The Company s financial statements have been prepared
on a going-concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal
course of business. The Company s liquidity and capital needs relate primarily to working capital and other general corporate requirements.

30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These factors raise concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, as discussed in the footnotes
to our financial statements. However, the company s management team has established a new plan for financing the Company s
operations in the short run, consisting of financial support by our current shareholders and management. The Company is currently
working with other entities to develop a new business plan. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arran g ements

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Summit
Networks Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Summit Networks Inc (the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders deficit and cash flows for each of the two years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated
financial statements and schedule (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the two years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

Substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern 

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
The Company had limited operations during the period from July 8, 2014 (date of inception) to September 30, 2024 resulting in accumulated
deficit of 1,410,627 and has not generated any revenue. There is no guarantee that Company will generate revenue and net income in the
future. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital surplus of 2,087,380. The cash used in operating activities were
 345,288. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements. The accompanying financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that:
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS
ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

None. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

At the end of the period covered by this Annual Report
on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Principal
Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports
that it files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for
accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
due primarily to a material weakness in the segregation of duties in the Company s internal control of financial reporting as discussed
below. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) and all related information
appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Management conducted an evaluation of the design and
operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report, based on the criteria in
a framework developed by the Company s management pursuant to and in compliance with the criteria established in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation
included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, walkthroughs of the operating effectiveness
of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was not effective, because management identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial
reporting related to the segregation of duties as described below. 

While the Company does adhere to internal controls
and processes that were designed and implemented based on the COSO report, it is difficult with a very limited staff to maintain appropriate
segregation of duties in the initiating and recording of transactions, thereby creating a segregation of duties weakness. Due to: (i)
the significance of segregation of duties to the preparation of reliable financial statements; (ii) the significance of potential misstatement
that could have resulted due to the deficient controls; and (iii) the absence of sufficient other mitigating controls, we determined that
this control deficiency resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement or lack of disclosure within the annual
or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected. 

- 22 - 

Management s Remediation Initiatives . 

Management has evaluated, and continues to evaluate,
avenues for mitigating our internal controls weaknesses, but mitigating controls to completely mitigate internal control weaknesses have
been deemed to be impractical and prohibitively costly, due to the size of our organization at the current time. Management expects to
continue to use reasonable care in following and seeking improvements to effective internal control processes that have been and continue
to be in use at the Company. 

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

There were no changes in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting that occurred prior to the Company s most recent financial quarter that materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Director Independence 

Our Company has three independent directors and all
directors also serve as members of the audit committee. 

The Board and Committees 

Our Company does not have separately designated standing
audit, nominating or compensation committees in place. Instead, our Company s entire board of directors has served, and currently serves,
in that capacity. This is due to the small number of executive officers involved with the Company and the fact that the Company operates
with few employees. Our board of directors will continue to evaluate, from time to time, whether a separately designated standing audit
committee should be put in place. We do not have an audit committee financial expert as that term is defined by the rules promulgated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We currently have limited working capital and limited revenues. Management does not believe
that is would be in our best interests at this time to retain independent directors to sit on an audit, nominating or compensation committee.
If we are able to generate sufficient revenues in the future, then we will likely seek out and retain independent directors and form an
audit committee. 

We have not adopted practices or polices regarding
employee, officer and director hedging in accordance with Item 407(i) of Regulation S-K. 

Legal Proceedings 

To the knowledge of our management, there are no material
proceedings to which any of our directors, officers or affiliates are a party adverse to our Company. 

Code of Ethics 

We intend at some point to adopt a code of ethics
that applies to our officers, directors and employees. We will file copies of our code of ethics in a current report on Form 8-K. You
will be able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the
code of ethics will be provided without charge upon request to us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions
of our code of ethics in a current report on Form 8-K. 

- 24 - 

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

There are no current employment agreements between
us and our directors and officers. We have never paid any compensation to any of our executive officers or directors. Our current officers
have agreed to work with no remuneration until such time as we receive sufficient revenues necessary to provide management salaries. At
this time, we cannot accurately estimate when sufficient revenues will occur that will allow us to begin paying this compensation, or
what the amount of the compensation will be. The Company currently has no annuity, pension or retirement benefits proposed to be paid
to our officers, directors or employees. 

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL
