All references in this Form 10-K to the Company, Verde, we, us or our are to Verde Resources, Inc. Item 1. Business. Overview Verde Resources, Inc. (the We or Company or VRDR was incorporated on April 22, 2010, in the State of Nevada, U.S.A.. The Company is a leader in Net Zero road construction and building materials, driving innovations that enhance sustainability and advance environmental stewardship. By integrating biochar, a highly effective carbon sequester and performance enhancer, the Company facilitates the industry s seamless Transition to Zero. This approach reduces GHG emissions, optimizes the use of native soils and recycled materials, speeds installation, and improves efficiency while cutting costs. Since 2021, the Company s BioFraction facility in Borneo has been converting palm waste into biochar and other sustainable byproducts. Although operations in Borneo, Malaysia, experienced a temporary slowdown during the financial year, this is due to the strategic focus on a test track partnership between its US-based subsidiary, Verde Renewables Inc., and the National Center for Asphalt Technology (NCAT). This partnership is rigorously testing the Company s innovative Biochar-Asphalt technology, which promises superior performance, environmental sustainability, and the generation of Carbon Removal and Avoidance Credits. Once this groundbreaking, eco-friendly solution is certified at the highest industry standards, the same blueprint will be introduced in Malaysia. Ongoing discussions with PLUS Malaysia, the country s largest highway operator, signal a growing demand for biochar in the region. This demand, coupled with the certification, will enable the BioFraction plant to secure a captive client, ensuring the resumption of normal operations in Malaysia with the potential for significant scale-up over time. The Company has undergone a restructuring exercise to shift its focus towards renewable energy and sustainable development with the world faced with challenges of climate change and environmental dehydration. The Company has announced the disposition of the mining business through the sale of the entire issued and paid-up share capital of Champmark Sdn Bhd CSB on March 13, 2023. The disposition of CSB was completed on April 20, 2023. The Company has discontinued its distribution of THC-free cannabinoid (CBD) products following the expiration of its supply agreement with MRX Xtractors, LLC on July 6, 2024. In line with this transition, the Company has made a strategic decision to fully divest from the Cannabis and CBD industry, similar to its previous divestment from mining operations in Malaysia, to concentrate solely on advancing its sustainability agenda. The Company conducts business operations in La Belle, Missouri, U.S.A., through Verde Renewables, Inc. VRI ), a company incorporated in the State of Missouri, U.S.A., and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Verde Estates, LLC VEL ), a Missouri limited liability company. Puro.earth, the crediting platform for durable carbon removal, has officially registered the Company as a Carbon Removal Credit supplier as part of its Accelerate program. This partnership was formalized through a platform agreement signed in April 2023. The Company s endeavors are poised to unlock revenue opportunities by generating Carbon Removal Credits (CORCs). This critical step incentivizes the broader adoption of climate technologies and enables the Company to supply these credits to companies seeking to offset their carbon footprint in pursuit of net-zero objectives. Simultaneously, this approach creates an additional and substantial revenue stream for the Company. The following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure: 3 Table of Contents Corporate History and Structure Verde Resources, Inc. was incorporated on April 22, 2010, in the State of Nevada, U.S.A. The following persons were appointed to serve as Directors and to assume the responsibilities of officers, on October 17, 2013: Mr. Wu Ming Ding, as President and Director; Mr. Balakrishnan B S Muthu as Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, General Manager and Director; and Mr. Liang Wai Keen as Secretary. On October 25, 2013, we entered into an Assignment Agreement for the Assignment of Management Right in Merapoh Gold Mines in Malaysia Assignment Agreement with Federal Mining Resources Limited FMR ), a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. FMR owned 85 equity interest in CSB, a private limited liability company incorporated in Malaysia. CSB is the Mining Contractor of the Mining Lease for Site IV-1 at the Merapoh Gold Mine under the Contract for Work with MMC Corporation Berhad, the Permit Holder of the Mining Lease. Under the terms of the Assignment Agreement, FMR had assigned its management rights of CSB s mining operation in the Mining Lease to the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Verde Resources Asia Pacific Limited VRAP in exchange for 80,000,000 shares of the Company s Common stock, which constituted 95.26 of our issued and outstanding capital stock as of and immediately after the consummation of the acquisition. VRAP was formed on February 7, 2013, by the Board of Directors of FMR to monitor the CSB operation. The acquisition of 100 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of VRAP was agreed upon on October 18, 2013, and completed on October 25, 2013, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors and the audit of VRAP. Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, and a Supplementary Agreement dated February 17, 2014, on further clarifications to the Assignment Agreement signed by the Company with FMR, the 100 interest of FMR in VRAP was transferred to VRDR at a consideration of One and no/100 Dollar 1.00). This transaction was recorded as a reverse acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-40 Reverse Acquisitions . The legal parent was VRDR, which was the accounting acquiree, while VRAP was the accounting acquirer. There was a 15 non-controlling interest of CSB after the acquisition. This transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein VRAP with its 85 deemed subsidiary CSB was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized. Prior to the acquisition of VRAP, on July 1, 2013, FMR had assigned its rights and obligations pursuant to its 85 interest in CSB to VRAP. According to ASC 810-05-08 A, CSB is a deemed subsidiary of VRAP because due to the assignment, VRAP had gained control of the Board of Directors of CSB, VRAP s rights to receive future benefits and residual value, and VRAP s obligation to absorb losses and provide financing for CSB. VRAP had the power to direct the activities of CSB that most significantly impact CSB s economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of CSB that could potentially be significant to CSB. Accordingly, VRAP was the primary beneficiary of CSB. Under 810-23-42, 43, it was determined that CSB was de-facto agent and VRAP, the principal, and consequently, CSB was considered as a deemed subsidiary of VRAP beginning July 1, 2013. With the above transactions, VRAP became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and CSB, its 85 deemed indirect subsidiary. On April 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of VRAP notified FMR of the decision to exercise its option to purchase an 85 equity interest of CSB pursuant to Section 3.2.4 of the Management Agreement dated July 1, 2013, between VRAP and FMR. This acquisition was completed on April 1, 2014, with consideration of 1, and VRAP then became an 85 shareholder of CSB. Effective February 20, 2016, Mr. Wu Ming Ding resigned from his positions as President and Director of the Company, with Mr. Balakrishnan B S Muthu being appointed President to fill the vacancy created. Effective February 20, 2016, Mr. Chen Ching was appointed Director of the Company and the entire Board of Directors then consisted of Mr. Balakrishnan B S Muthu and Mr. Chen Ching. Effective February 2, 2018, our Articles of Incorporation were amended to increase the authorized shares of the Company from 250,000,000 shares of Common stock to 10,000,000,000 shares of Common stock. A copy of the Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State.

Craven was appointed Director of the Company, and the entire Board of Directors then consisted of Mr. Balakrishnan B S Muthu, Mr. Chen Ching and Mr. Carl M. Craven.

The Project, led by Dr. Nam Tran, Associate Director and Research Professor at NCAT, will involve comprehensive performance testing on the NCAT Test Track in Opelika, Alabama. This facility, sponsored by various state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and in partnership with the Minnesota Road Research Facility (MnROAD), is dedicated to advancing sustainable pavement technologies. The NCAT Test Track will be constructed in the summer of 2024 to evaluate cutting-edge technologies co-developed by the Company and Zym-Tec. These innovations utilize enzymes to treat expansive soils and stabilize marginal base materials, potentially reducing or eliminating the need for carbon-intensive materials such as hydrated lime and Portland cement. Additionally, integrating biochar from biomass pyrolysis into enzyme-treated pavement materials is expected to improve performance, substantially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and sequester carbon dioxide. This pioneering approach is projected to generate Carbon Removal Credits upon completion of the test track installation, proving the viability of this next-generation blueprint for net-zero road construction. The Company is confident in its Verde-ZymTec technology and aspires to attain the highest level of certification from NCAT. Success in this Project is expected to drive widespread adoption of a net-zero road construction blueprint by DOTs across the United States and the federal DOT. Additionally, the substantial Carbon Removal Credits generated will create a significant and separate revenue stream for the Company. The Project commences on June 24, 2024, and is expected to conclude on September 30, 2027, with the first draft of the final report expected in spring 2027. The Company has committed 750,000 to support the Project, with an initial payment of 100,000 upon execution of the Agreement, followed by quarterly payments of 50,000 from September 2024 to March 2025, and 62,500 from June 2025 to September 2026. Stage of Operation The Company has diversified into the green industry with its acquisition of Bio Resources Ltd BRL ), the beneficial and/or registered proprietor of the intellectual property known as Catalytic Biofraction Process , which is a slow pyrolysis process using a proprietary catalyst to depolymerise palm biomass wastes (empty fruit bunches or palm kernel shells) in temperature range of 350 degree Celsius to 500 degree Celsius to yield commercially valuable bio products: bio-oil, wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid), biochar and bio-syngas. The intellectual property is a second-generation pyrolysis process where non-food feedstock like the palm biomass wastes is used as feedstock. The Company s BioFraction technology produces high-quality raw biochar using recycled organic biomass from the dairy, palm, and other natural resource industries. The Company also produces activated biochar, which undergoes further processing combined with natural enzymes, minerals, and microbial additives. Biochar can be the key component towards rebuilding and enhancing coral life and marine ecosystems throughout coastal regions. The Company will explore developing blue carbon technologies using biochar as an additive within carbon-negative cement mixtures that can be molded into a variety of useful marine structures and environments. We have begun research and development of various biochar cement compound mixtures, such as raw atmospheric injected CO 2 , precast eco-friendly cement. We will engage international and regional industry experts, institutes and educational communities, focused towards developing a unique line of blue carbon capturing products for coastal aquatic and marine environments. The Company is working alongside lawmakers that will assist in shaping future climate bills, where increased standards and beneficial solutions in agriculture can be implemented to help aid with further political legislation towards climate mitigation and adaptation. We will engage key stakeholders to develop licensed and accountable measures that will assist in shaping and defining a sustainable credit exchange for the commercial market. On August 7, 2023, the Company announced a momentous partnership with Green Carbon Industries GCI ), securing exclusive access to their invaluable intellectual property (IP) rights. This groundbreaking collaboration lays the foundation for revolutionary infrastructure development, marked by innovative biochar asphalt showcase projects within the United States. These projects complement GCI s established successes in the Asia Pacific (APAC), Middle East, and Africa regions. Our shared commitment revolves around validating the concept s feasibility and scalability for carbon sequestration, thereby transforming global infrastructure development, and proactively addressing pressing environmental challenges. Subsequently on May 15, 2024, the Company and GCI mutually agreed to terminate the collaboration laid out in this partnership in its entirety. Biochar-asphalt, an innovative, eco-friendly, high performance, and cost-saving alternative to conventional high CO 2 footprint asphalt production and installation, holds immense promise in addressing environmental concerns. Through the integration and extensive utilization of biochar a carbon-rich material derived from organic waste, the Company aims to reduce carbon emissions and the carbon footprint of infrastructure projects. The American showcase projects will serve as compelling evidence of the technology s capability in carbon sequestration, efficiently mitigating greenhouse gas, enhancing durability and cost efficiencies, all while simultaneously addressing pressing environmental challenges. In 2023, Puro.earth, the world s foremost crediting platform for durable carbon removal, officially registered the Company as a Carbon Removal Credit supplier as part of its Accelerate program. This partnership was formalized through a platform agreement signed in April 2023. It is worth noting that Puro.earth was acquired by Nasdaq in June 2021. Furthermore, the Company s endeavors are poised to unlock revenue opportunities by generating Carbon Removal Credits (CORCs). This critical step incentivizes the broader adoption of climate technologies and enables the Company to supply these credits to companies seeking to offset their carbon footprint in pursuit of net-zero objectives. Simultaneously, this approach creates an additional and substantial revenue stream for the Company. 10 Table of Contents On August 30, 2023, the Company achieved a significant milestone by conducting the first-ever biochar-asphalt installation in the United States, just outside of Chicago, Illinois.

Near-term Requirements For Additional Capital We believe that we will require approximately 2 million over the next 18 months to implement our business plan. For the immediate future, we intend to finance our business expansion efforts through loans and investments from existing shareholders, financial institutions and investors. Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated with Verde Resources, Inc. We are dependent on certain key personnel and loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Mr. Jack Wong, our current principal executive officer, has extensive contacts and experience in the green climate-tech industry in U.S.A., and we are dependent upon his abilities and services to develop and market our business. He is responsible for overseeing all of our day-to-day business operations of our operating company, VRI, and its subsidiary VEL, including the operations and negotiations for the sales of its activated biochar and other bio products. We may not be able to retain the executive officer/manager for any given period of time. The loss of his services could have a material adverse effect upon our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we must attract, recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically competent employees in U.S.A. to run our operations. Our ability to effectively implement our proposed business strategies and expand our operations will depend upon the successful recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced management and other key personnel in U.S.A. If we cannot maintain highly experienced and skilled management teams, our business could fail and you could lose any investment you make in our shares. The COVID-19 and other future pandemics may result in significant deterioration and disruption in national and local economic conditions and record levels of unemployment, which may have a material impact on our business operations. The COVID-19 and future pandemics may create extensive disruptions to the global economy, to businesses, and to the lives of individuals throughout the world. Federal and state governments would have to take actions to contain the spread of the disease, including quarantines, travel bans, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. The spread of COVID-19 has decreased substantially but there may be potential risk to the increased spread of new, more transmissible coronavirus variants, the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and other future pandemics may increase again. The substantial increase in these infections may cause state and local governments to consider, and in some cases implement, various activity restrictions and containment measures that previously had been lifted. The uncertain future development of the pandemic situations could materially and adversely affect our business operations. Impact of current global economic climate has increased uncertainty of our future operations Impact of changes in global economic conditions, including inflation, has increased uncertainty of our business operations. Changes in global economic conditions, including inflation which resulted in lower consumer confidence, may continue to have negative impact on our business, revenues and earnings. Inflation rates have increased and may continue to rise. Our suppliers may continue to raise prices that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. This may continue to affect our business, including our competitive position, market share, revenues and profit margins. Impact of global tensions may increase uncertainty of our future operations. The global tensions arising from the Ukraine-Russian war and Hamas-Israel war may result in disruptions in the broader global economic environment. 12 Table of Contents We are subject to the many risks of doing business internationally, including but not limited to the difficulty of enforcing liabilities in foreign jurisdictions. We are a Nevada corporation and, as such, are subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Nevada and the United States courts for purposes of any lawsuit, action or proceeding by investors. An investor would have the ability to effect service of process in any action against the Company within the United States. In addition, we are registered as a foreign corporation doing business in Malaysia, and as such, are subject to the local laws of Malaysia governing an investors ability to bring actions in foreign courts and enforce liabilities against a foreign private issuer, or any person, based on U.S. federal securities laws. Investors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in Malaysia based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws against us or our management. Some of our current operations are conducted in Malaysia, and some of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of Malaysia and other foreign countries. All or substantially all of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States and in other foreign countries. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside Malaysia upon these persons. In addition, uncertainty exists as to whether the courts of Malaysia would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or such officers and/or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Malaysia against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent our transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. Our executive officers and employees have not been subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prior to 2010. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our business. The current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. Such initiatives have been pursued with rigor under the current Administration. To the extent that these initiatives lead to the promulgation of new regulations or supervisory guidance applicable to the Company, we would expect to experience increased compliance costs and other compliance-related risks. If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected. Malaysian companies may not always adopt a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and computer, financial and other control systems. In addition, we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in Malaysia. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards for foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we may experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls, which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure of our public accounting firm s attestation to or report on management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our Common Stock. 13 Table of Contents Our independent registered auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our audited financial statements included in this report include an explanatory paragraph that indicates that they were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. We have suffered recurring net losses, and record an accumulated deficits as of June 30, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months depends on the successful validation and certification of its Net Zero road construction blueprint by the National Center for Asphalt Technology (NCAT) and its adherence to established carbon removal and avoidance methodologies. Achieving these milestones will enable the Company to generate revenue through the commercial licensing of the blueprint, royalties from biochar-asphalt mix designs, carbon credits, and sales of biochar and bio-fuel. On August 8th, CRH, the largest building materials company in North America and Europe, listed on both the NYSE and the London Stock Exchange, announced through its investment arm, CRH Ventures, that it has selected the Company to scale up its biochar-asphalt technology for commercialization. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our plans described above. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations, stockholders equity (deficit) and fair value of net assets. Our investment activities and credit guarantee activities expose us to interest rate and other market risks. Changes in interest rates, up or down, could adversely affect our net interest yield. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, either can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest yield to expand or compress. For example, due to the timing of maturities or rate reset dates on variable-rate instruments, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets. This rate change could cause our net interest yield to compress until the effect of the increase is fully reflected in asset yields. Changes in the slope of the yield curve could also reduce our net interest yield. Interest rates can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including changes in the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, such as the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve policies directly and indirectly influence the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. The availability of derivative financial instruments (such as options and interest rate and foreign currency swaps) from acceptable counterparties of the types and in the quantities needed could also affect our ability to effectively manage the risks related to our investment funding. Our strategies and efforts to manage our exposures to these risks may not be effective in the future, which could negatively impact our results of operations and the price of our common stock. We may be exposed to risks relating to management s conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective. We do not have an independent audit committee and our Board of Directors may be unable to fulfill the functions of such a committee, which may compromise the management of our business. Our Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of three directors, none of whom are considered to be independent in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessment of the Company s processes relating to its risks and control environment, oversight of financial reporting, and evaluation of internal and independent audit processes. The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the Board of Directors from being independent in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the committee s responsibilities, which could compromise the management of our business. If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected. Malaysian companies may not always adopt a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and computer, financial and other control systems. In addition, we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in Malaysia. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards for foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we may experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls, which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure of our public accounting firm s attestation to or report on management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our Common Stock. 14 Table of Contents Risks Associated with Our Common Stock Our shares are defined as penny stock. The rules imposed on the sale of the shares may affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Our shares are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of 5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000, or 300,000 jointly with spouse, or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement prior to the sale. In addition, the broker-dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to make a market in or trade our Common Stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase. Market for penny stock has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse Stockholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include: Control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; Manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; Boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced salespersons; Excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and, The wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequential investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price. Inability and unlikelihood to pay dividends To date, we have not paid, nor do we intend to pay in the foreseeable future, dividends on our Common Stock, even if we become profitable. Earnings, if any, are expected to be used to advance our activities and for general corporate purposes, rather than to make distributions to stockholders. Prospective investors will likely need to rely on an increase in the price of Company stock to profit from his or her investment. There are no guarantees that any market for our common stock will ever develop or that the price of our stock will ever increase. Since we are not in a financial position to pay dividends on our common stock and future dividends are not presently being contemplated, investors are advised that return on investment in our common stock is restricted to an appreciation in the share price. The potential or likelihood of an increase in share price is questionable at best. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. 15 Table of Contents Item 2. Properties.

[Reserved] . 17 Table of Contents Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report, particularly in the section entitled Risk Factors of this annual report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Results of Operations The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the years ended June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023. Statement of Operation June 30, 2024 2023 Change USD USD USD Revenue 96,584 100,777 (4,193 (4.2 Cost of revenue (62,978 (238,153 175,175 (73.6 Gross profit (loss) 33,606 (137,376 170,982 (124.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses (2,882,376 (3,216,022 333,646 (10.4 Other operating expenses (237,047 - (237,047 Loss from operation (3,085,817 (3,353,398 267,581 (8.0 Interest expense (176,483 (1,918,572 1,742,089 (90.8 Other income 74,638 1,273,010 (1,198,372 (94.1 Net loss before income tax (3,187,662 (3,998,960 811,298 (20.3 Provision of Income Tax (112 - (112 NET LOSS (3,187,774 (3,998,960 811,186 (20.3 Revenue The revenue was derived from sale of Biochar Asphalt Premix in 2024 in addition to the distribution of renewable commodities and compost spreading in 2023. We have generated 96,584 and 100,777 revenues for the years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, Revenue decreased primarily due to the non-generation of revenue from compost spreading offset by the increase in the sale of Biochar Asphalt Premix in 2024. A gross profit of 33,606 compared to a gross loss of 137,376 for the year ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 respectively. Cost of revenue Cost of revenue decreased from 238,153 to 62,978 during the year ended June 30, 2024 due to cessation of the operations in the production and distribution of renewable commodities. Arising from this, the expenditure related to the plant have been categorized under other operating expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses comprised mainly of salaries, office costs, legal and professional fees, consultancy fee and travelling expenses. We have incurred 2,882,376 and 3,216,022 in selling, general and administrative expenses through June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023 respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 10.4 , or 333,646, primarily due to decrease of consultancy fee as most of the agreements with service providers expired in current financial year and the new agreements were only entered into in the last 2 months of the current financial year and selling, general and administrative expenses contributed by CSB which was disposed on April 20, 2023. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses comprised of expenditure related to the operations of the plant in the production and distribution of renewable commodities which have been categorized under other operating expenses. This categorization was due there being no production processed by the plant for the year ended 30 June 2024. Interest expense The Company recorded interest expense of 116,917 and 1,881,807 on the promissory notes for the years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Lease interest expenses amounted to 45,926 and 35,344 for the years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Bank loan interest amounted to 13,640 and 1,421 for the years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is mainly due to conversion of promissory notes with a principal amount of 20,355,000 on December 9, 2022 and accordingly no further interest charges recorded with regards to the PN thereafter. The charge in the current period is in respect of a new PN issued of 675,888. Other income We have other income of 74,638 and 1,273,010 for the year ended June 30, 2024, and 2023. Other income of 1,215,689 for the year ended June 30, 2023, was mainly due to gain on disposal of a subsidiary of 980,714 and fair value adjustment on convertible promissory notes issued to BOC of 194,865. The balance mainly represented rental income earned. Net loss As a result of the above factors, the Company recorded a net loss of 3,187,774 and 3,998,960 for the years ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 18 Table of Contents Plan of Operation Expansion Plans The Company is diversifying into the green industry with its acquisition of Bio Resources Ltd BRL ), the beneficial and/or registered proprietor of the intellectual property known as Catalytic Biofraction Process , which is a slow pyrolysis process using a proprietary catalyst to depolymerise palm biomass wastes (empty fruit bunches or palm kernel shells) in temperature range of 350 degC to 500 degC to yield commercially valuable bio products: bio-oil, wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid), biochar and bio-syngas. The intellectual property is a second-generation pyrolysis process where non-food feedstock like the palm biomass wastes is used as feedstock. The Company is working to lay the foundation for revolutionary infrastructure development, marked by innovative biochar asphalt showcase projects within the United States. Our commitment revolves around validating the concept s feasibility and scalability for carbon sequestration, thereby transforming global infrastructure development, and proactively addressing pressing environmental challenges. Biochar-asphalt, an innovative, eco-friendly, high performance, and cost-saving alternative to conventional high CO 2 footprint asphalt production and installation, holds immense promise in addressing environmental concerns. Through the integration and extensive utilization of biochar a carbon-rich material derived from organic waste, The Company aims to reduce carbon emissions and the carbon footprint of infrastructure projects. The American showcase projects will serve as compelling evidence of the technology s capability in carbon sequestration, efficiently mitigating greenhouse gas, enhancing durability and cost efficiencies, all while simultaneously addressing pressing environmental challenges. In 2023, Puro.earth, the world s foremost crediting platform for durable carbon removal, officially registered the Company as a Carbon Removal Credit supplier as part of its Accelerate program. This partnership was formalized through a platform agreement signed in April 2023. It is worth noting that Puro.earth was acquired by Nasdaq in June 2021. The Company s endeavors are poised to unlock revenue opportunities by generating Carbon Removal Credits (CORCs). This critical step incentivizes the broader adoption of climate technologies and enables the Company to supply these credits to companies seeking to offset their carbon footprint in pursuit of net-zero objectives. Simultaneously, this approach creates an additional and substantial revenue stream for the Company. The Company achieved a significant milestone by conducting the first-ever biochar-asphalt installation in the United States, just outside of Chicago, Illinois in August 2023. Subsequently, we replicated this success at our own facility in La Belle, Missouri. In September 2023, upon the invitation of the City of Gramercy, located near New Orleans, Louisiana, the Company executed another biochar-asphalt installation. As a testament to our efforts, we have already received several Letters of Intent (LOIs), and we are confident that our transition from mining to climate-tech and the green economy will yield tremendous results for the company in the years ahead. The Company entered into a Services Agreement with Donald R. Fosnacht in October 2023 to engage him as National Certification and Extensive BCR (Biochar Carbon Removal) Implementation Specialist to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to obtain national and regional certification and endorsement for carbon net-negative construction products with high biochar content, encompassing asphalt, concrete, and soil stabilization as designated in the Services Agreement. The Company entered into two Services Agreements with Dr. Nam Tran and Dr. Raymond Powell in April 2024 to engage them as National Implementation Experts for its wholly-owned subsidiary Verde Renewables, Inc. to initiate connections with esteemed asphalt contractors, identify potential partners, explore potential collaborations through their extensive networks in the asphalt industry and recommend strategies to capitalize on emerging opportunities as designated in the Agreements. Furthermore, the Company entered into a Services Agreement with Dale Ludwig in June 2024 to engage him as Strategic Advisor to maintain and build strong relationships with policymakers at both state and federal levels, collaborate with Missouri Department of Transportation, build relationships with Missouri Asphalt Pavement Association (MAPA) members, collaborate with Missouri contractors to encourage the use of the Company's technologies, identify current biochar producers in Missouri and engage with the Missouri Department of Economic Development. On June 27, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with The National Center for Asphalt Technology at Auburn University ("NCAT") to undertake a 3-year Performance Testing Project titled Structural Capacity of Sustainable Pavement . The Project, led by Dr. Nam Tran, Associate Director and Research Professor at NCAT, will involve comprehensive performance testing on the NCAT Test Track in Opelika, Alabama. This facility, sponsored by various state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and in partnership with the Minnesota Road Research Facility (MnROAD), is dedicated to advancing sustainable pavement technologies. The NCAT Test Track will be constructed in the summer of 2024 to evaluate cutting-edge technologies that utilize enzymes to treat expansive soils and stabilize marginal base materials, potentially reducing or eliminating the need for carbon-intensive materials such as hydrated lime and Portland cement. Additionally, integrating biochar from biomass pyrolysis into enzyme-treated pavement materials is expected to improve performance, substantially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and sequester carbon dioxide. This pioneering approach is projected to generate Carbon Removal Credits upon completion of the test track installation, proving the viability of this next-generation blueprint for net-zero road construction. The Company is confident in its technology and aspires to attain the highest level of certification from NCAT. Success in this Project is expected to drive widespread adoption of a net-zero road construction blueprint by DOTs across the United States and the federal DOT. Additionally, the substantial Carbon Removal Credits generated will create a significant and separate revenue stream for the Company. The Project is expected to conclude in September 2027, with the first draft of the final report expected in spring 2027. 19 Table of Contents Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in the exploration of our properties, and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from private placements. Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on the sale of our products, which are still under development stage.

The increase in cash used in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 2023 was primarily due to increase of inventories for production and distribution of renewable commodities and decrease of advanced from related parties. In the operation analysis, the net cash used in operating activities decreased from 1,656,896 to 2,042,064. The operation loss of 3,187,662 was partially offset by the noncash expenses such as 417,517 in depreciation, 115,359 in amortization, 388,048 in share-based compensation, 103,380 in interest expenses on promissory notes, 45,926 in lease interest expense, 57,323 in impairment of receivables, 177,200 from advance to supplier written off, 134,042 in impairment of assets held for sale, property, plant and equipment written off of 3,979, write down of inventories of 15,587, inventories written off of 5,978 and 21,316 from deposit on acquisition of subsidiary written off.

The cash flow situation will not allow for operations in the coming next 12 months by self-generated cash provided from operating activities. The Company needs to increase cash flow supplies with a long-term plan until the Company makes sustainable profits and has a positive cash flow. Otherwise, loans from related parties may be a temporary solution, although we have no written loan agreements. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure adequate financing. If we fail to secure sufficient funds, our business activities may be curtailed, or we may cease to operate. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.

Opinion on the Financial Statement We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Verde Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3, the Company has generated recurring losses and suffered from an accumulated deficit of 13,480,204 as of June 30, 2024. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans with regards to these matters are also described in Note 3 to the financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current year audit of the financial statements that were communicated or are required to be communicated to the audit committee, or in their absence, the directors, and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements, and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Assessment for impairment of Intellectual Properties As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the intangible assets acquired from third parties are measured initially at fair value with an infinite live that are not being amortized. The Company annually evaluates the recoverability of the infinite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future discounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such a review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. F-2 Table of Contents Our key considerations for the determination the fair value of the intangible assets, comprising Intellectual Properties IP as a critical audit matter was due to the high degree of judgement involved in the assessment of the assumptions used in deriving the future discounted cash flows as included in the worksheets presented to us to justify their carrying values of the IP. These were assessed by: i) Critically evaluating management s assessment for their rationale and justification of the assumptions used; ii) Discussions with the key management and operational personnel of the Company to understand the future plans, their assumptions and expected income to be derived; ii) Obtained necessary supporting information and published reports to support the forecast demand and productions and prices used in the worksheets; ii) Ascertaining formulas and linkages in the worksheets were properly set up; iii) Performing stress tests by reducing assumed demand and production to determine impact on cash flows and carrying values. /s/ Certified Public Accountants Firm ID: We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months depends on the successful validation and certification of its Net Zero road construction blueprint by the National Center for Asphalt Technology (NCAT) and its adherence to established carbon removal and avoidance methodologies. Achieving these milestones will enable the Company to generate revenue through the commercial licensing of the blueprint, royalties from biochar-asphalt mix designs, carbon credits, and sales of biochar and bio-fuel. On August 8th, CRH, the largest building materials company in North America and Europe, listed on both the NYSE and the London Stock Exchange, announced through its investment arm, CRH Ventures, that it has selected the Company to scale up its biochar-asphalt technology for commercialization. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its plans described above. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

The Catalytic Biofraction Process is a slow pyrolysis process using a proprietary catalyst to depolymerize palm biomass wastes (empty fruit bunches or palm kernel shells) in temperature range of 350 degrees Celsius to 500 degrees Celsius to yield commercially valuable bio products: bio-oil, wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid), biochar and bio-syngas. The intellectual property is a second-generation pyrolysis process where non-food feedstock like palm biomass wastes is used as feedstock. Upon fulfilling UN s (United Nations) ACM 22 protocol as well as LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) requirements, it is anticipated that the by-products from this IP would lead to certification and issuance of Carbon Avoidance Credits as well as Carbon Removal Credits to generate carbon revenue for the Company. During the annual impairment assessment, a quantitative assessment was conducted, which involved estimating the fair value of the asset using the income approach. The results indicated that the carrying amount of the asset was not impaired, and therefore no impairment loss was recognized for the period. Key assumptions in the quantitative assessment included: Discount Rate : Plant daily capacity : The plant daily capacity is 0.8 MT per hour for the existing plant and 2.5 MT per hour for the additional new plants that will be commissioned. Additional plants : One new biofraction plant with a 3.0 MT/hour production rate will be added every year from FYE2027 up to FYE 2034. Projected Production and Sales : Based on a ten-year forecast. Production and sales volumes are linked to the plants in operation for each year in the forecasted period based on the output yield percentages. Inflation : 2 The use of the estimates in the quantitative assessment are highly judgmental and actual results may differ significantly from what is currently assessed. Accordingly, fluctuations in any of the key attributes may result in a significant change in the projected cash flows underlying the quantitative assessment, which could have a material impact on the assessed values of the Intangible Asset.

F-31 Table of Contents Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date ). During the financial year, the Company has been undertaking tremendous changes and expansion which rendered the management to re-consider the availability of more management talents and professional staff to meet the enlargement in operation under the coming acquisition and expansion move. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of June 30, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. During 2023 and into 2024, the Company had undertaken tremendous enlargement and expansion, including restructuring of operations, which rendered the management to re-consider the availability of more management talents and professional staff to meet the enlargement in operation during and after the coming acquisition and expansion move. Based on this consideration and that evaluation, the current management concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (4) management is dominated by three individuals without adequate compensating controls; and (5) lack of financial personnel with sufficient knowledge and experience with U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines and SEC regulations. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Financial Officers in connection with the review of our financial statements as of June 30, 2024. Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above may have an immediate negative effect on our financial results because of our enlargement of operation. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements if the Company were growing substantially after the expansion move was materialized. 21 Table of Contents Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. With the participation of our Chief Executive and Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based upon such evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on the COSO framework criteria because of the enlargement in operation. The management acknowledged that there is room for further improvement in maintaining effective internal control and shall take steps to implement management s remediation initiatives during and after that expansion, This includes recruiting more management talents and professional staff, committing the entire organization to allocate necessary organizational resources, and cross-functional collaboration focused on strengthening the Company s quality systems and operating culture. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption for non-accelerated filers from the internal control audit requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In order to cure the foregoing material weakness, we have taken or are taking the following remediation measures: - We have been working on recruitment of more management talents and professional staff to fill in the gap of shortage of personnel under enlargement of operation during and after this expansion move. With the enlargement of operation, the management needs to re-consider and re-evaluate the entire internal control reporting system and related risk and changes. - We have regularly offered our financial personnel trainings on internal control and risk management. Also, we have regularly provided trainings to our financial personnel on U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines. We plan to continue to provide trainings to our financial team and our other relevant personnel on the U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines applicable to our financial reporting requirements. - We have engaged with an external consultant to ascertain compliance with the regulatory reporting requirements. The Company utilizes this third-party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third-party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions We intend to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses discussed above as soon as practicable, but we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so. Designing and implementing an effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that adequately satisfies our reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken and intend to take may not fully address the material weakness that we have identified, and material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures may be identified in the future. Should we discover such conditions, we intend to remediate them as soon as practicable. We are committed to taking appropriate steps for remediation, as needed.

Executive Compensation. Compensation Philosophy and Objectives Our executive compensation philosophy is to create a long-term direct relationship between pay and our performance. Our executive compensation program is designed to provide a balanced total compensation package over the executive s career with us. The compensation program objectives are to attract, motivate and retain the qualified executives that help ensure our future success, to provide incentives for increasing our profits by awarding executives when corporate goals are achieved and to align the interests of executives and long-term stockholders. The compensation package of our named executive officers consists of two main elements: 1. base salary for our executives that is competitive relative to the market, and that reflects individual performance, retention and other relevant considerations; and 2. discretionary bonus awards payable in cash or equity and tied to the satisfaction of corporate objectives. Process for Setting Executive Compensation Until such time as we establish a Compensation Committee, our Board is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to the compensation of executives and for monitoring the implementation and results of the compensation philosophy to ensure compensation remains competitive, creates proper incentives to enhance stockholder value and rewards superior performance. We expect to annually review and approve for each named executive officer, and particularly with regard to the Chief Executive Officer, all components of the executive s compensation. We process and factors (including individual and corporate performance measures and actual performance versus such measures) used by the Chief Executive Officer to recommend such awards. Additionally, we expect to review and approve the base salary, equity-incentive awards (if any) and any other special or supplemental benefits of the named executive officers. The Chief Executive Officer periodically provides the Board with an evaluation of each named executive officer s performance, based on the individual performance goals and objectives developed by the Chief Executive Officer at the beginning of the year, as well as other factors. The Board provides an evaluation for the Chief Executive Officer. These evaluations serve as the bases for bonus recommendations and changes in the compensation arrangements of our named executives. Our Compensation Peer Group We currently engage in informal market analysis in evaluating our executive compensation arrangements. As the Company and its businesses mature, we may retain compensation consultants that will assist us in developing a formal benchmark and selecting a compensation peer group of companies similar to us in size or business for the purpose of comparing executive compensation levels. Program Components Our executive compensation program consists of the following elements: Base Salary Our base salary structure is designed to encourage internal growth, attract and retain new talent, and reward strong leadership that will sustain our growth and profitability. The base salary for each named executive officer reflects our past and current operating profits, the named executive officer s individual contribution to our success throughout his career, internal pay equity and informal market data regarding comparable positions within similarly situated companies. In determining and setting base salary, the Board considers all of these factors, though it does not assign specific weights to any factor. The Board generally reviews the base salary for each named executive officer on an annual basis. For each of our named executive officers, we review base salary data internally obtained by the Company for comparable executive positions in similarly situated companies to ensure that the base salary rate for each executive is competitive relative to the market. Discretionary Bonus The objectives of our bonus awards are to encourage and reward our employees, including the named executive officers, who contribute to and participate in our success by their ability, industry, leadership, loyalty or exceptional service and to recruit additional executives who will contribute to that success. 26 Table of Contents Summary Compensation Table The following summary compensation table sets forth the aggregate compensation we paid or accrued during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 to (i) our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), (ii) our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), (iii) our three most highly compensated executive officers other than the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer who were serving as executive officers on June 30, 2023, whose total compensation was in excess of 100,000, and (iv) up to two additional individuals who would have been within the two-other-most-highly compensated but were not serving as executive officers on June 30, 2023.

We have no material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except that stock options may be granted at the discretion of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. Compensation Risk Management Our Board of directors and human resources staff conducted an assessment of potential risks that may arise from our compensation programs. Based on this assessment, we concluded that our policies and practices do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking that would be reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on the Company. The assessment included our cash incentive programs, which awards non-executives with cash bonuses for punctuality. Our compensation programs are substantially identical among business units, corporate functions and global locations (with modifications to comply with local regulations as appropriate). The risk-mitigating factors considered in this assessment included: the alignment of pay philosophy, peer group companies and compensation amounts relative to local competitive practices to support our business objectives; and effective balance of cash, short- and long-term performance periods, caps on performance-based award schedules and financial metrics with individual factors and Board and management discretion. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation We do not currently have a compensation committee and, for the year ended June 30, 2024, the compensation, if any, of our executive officers was recommended by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman and such recommendations were approved by our Board of Directors.
