 Seasonality 
 
 Because of the diversity of our customer base, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality in our business in recent years. However, we cannot predict whether this trend will continue. 
 
 Backlog 
 
 We generally do not obtain firm, long-term commitments from our customers and our customers usually do not make firm orders for product delivery more than thirty to ninety days in advance. Additionally, customers may cancel or postpone scheduled deliveries, in some cases without significant penalty. Therefore, we do not believe the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm orders is a meaningful measure of future sales. 
 
 Customers and Marketing 
 
 A key component of our strategy is to attract and retain long-term customer partnerships with leading companies in growth industries that will benefit from our global/regional footprint and unique value proposition in advanced electronics manufacturing. We develop relationships with our customers and market our vertically integrated manufacturing solutions through our sales and marketing staff. Our sales team works closely with our customers' engineering and technical personnel to understand their strategy and roadmaps to enable their go-to-market strategy. Our sales and marketing staff supports our business strategy of providing end-to-end solutions by encouraging cross-selling vertically integrated manufacturing solutions and component manufacturing across a broad range of major OEM products. We utilize our existing technical capabilities in design, technology components, and complex assembly, integration, and after-sales services to provide tailored solutions to our customers. With our extensive market knowledge and global/regional footprint, we can align these solutions to our facilities in each region around the world. 
 
 Sales to our ten largest customers represented 47 of our net sales in 2024. Motorola represented 10 or more of our net sales in 2024 and 2022. Nokia represented 10 or more of our net sales in 2023 and 2022. 
 
 We typically enter into supply agreements with our major OEM customers with terms ranging from three to five years. Our supply agreements generally do not obligate the customer to purchase minimum quantities of products. However, the customer is typically liable for the cost of the materials and components we have ordered to meet their production forecast but which are not used, provided that the material was ordered in accordance with an agreed-upon procurement plan. In some cases, the procurement plan contains provisions regarding the types of materials for which our customers will assume responsibility. Our supply agreements generally contain provisions permitting cancellation and rescheduling of orders upon notice and are subject to cancellation charges and, in some cases, rescheduling charges. In some circumstances, our supply agreements with customers include provisions for cost reduction objectives during the term of the agreement, which can have the effect of reducing revenue and profitability from these arrangements. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Our business is highly competitive. We compete against numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturing service providers, diversified manufacturing service providers and design providers. In addition, our potential customers may also compare the benefits of outsourcing their manufacturing to us with the merits of manufacturing products themselves. 
 
 We compete with different companies depending on the type of solution or geographic area. We believe the primary competitive factors in our industry include manufacturing technology, quality, global/regional footprint, delivery, responsiveness, provision of value-added solutions and price. We believe we are extremely competitive with regard to all of these factors.

 Intellectual Property 
 
 We hold U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications relating to, among other things, printed circuit board manufacturing technology, enclosures, cables, memory modules, optical technology, medical devices and computing and storage. For other proprietary processes, we rely primarily on trade secret protection. A number of our patents have expired or will expire in the near term. The expiration and abandonment of patents reduces our ability to assert claims against competitors or others who use similar technologies and to license such patents to third parties. We have registered a number of trademarks and have pending trademark applications in both the U.S. and internationally. Sanmina, Viking, Viking Enterprise Solutions, Viking Technology and 42Q are registered trademarks of Sanmina Corporation. 
 
 Compliance with Government Regulations 
 
 Environmental Regulations 
 
 We are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage and use of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes, as well as the storage, treatment, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous waste that are by-products of these processes. We are also subject to occupational safety and health laws, product labeling and product content requirements, either directly or as required by our customers. Proper waste disposal is a major consideration for printed circuit board manufacturers due to the metals and chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Water used in the printed circuit board manufacturing process must be treated to remove metal particles and other contaminants before it can be discharged into municipal sanitary sewer systems. We operate on-site wastewater treatment systems at our printed circuit board manufacturing plants in order to treat wastewater generated in the fabrication process. 
 
 Additionally, the electronics assembly process can generate lead dust. Upon vacating a facility, we are responsible for remediating lead dust from the interior of the manufacturing facility. Although there are no applicable standards for lead dust remediation in manufacturing facilities, we endeavor to remove the residues. To date, lead dust remediation costs have not been material to our results of operations. We also monitor for airborne concentrations of lead in our buildings and are unaware of any significant lead concentrations that exceed the applicable Occupational Safety Health Administration OSHA or other local standards. 
 
 We have a range of corporate programs that aim to reduce the use of hazardous materials in manufacturing. We developed corporate-wide standardized environmental management systems, auditing programs and policies to enable better management of environmental compliance activities. For example, almost all of our manufacturing facilities are certified under ISO 14001, a set of standards and procedures relating to environmental compliance management. In addition, the electronics industry must adhere to the European Union's Restrictions of Hazardous Substances RoHS and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment WEEE ). Parallel initiatives have been adopted in other jurisdictions throughout the world, including several states in the U.S. and the Peoples' Republic of China. RoHS limits the use of lead, mercury and other specified substances in electronics products. WEEE requires producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components. We have implemented procedures intended to ensure our manufacturing processes are compliant with RoHS and the European Union's Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals REACH legislation, when required. WEEE compliance is primarily the responsibility of OEMs. 
 
 Asbestos containing materials ACM are present at several of our manufacturing facilities. Although ACM is being managed and controls have been put in place pursuant to ACM operations and maintenance plans, the presence of ACM could give rise to remediation obligations and other liabilities. 
 
 Our facilities generally operate under environmental permits issued by governmental authorities. For the most part, these permits must be renewed periodically and are subject to revocation in the event of violations of environmental laws. Any such revocation may require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, adversely affecting our results of operations. 
 
 In connection with certain acquisitions, we have incurred liabilities associated with environmental contamination. These include ongoing investigation and remediation activities at a number of current and former sites, including those located in Owego, New York; Derry, New Hampshire; and Brockville, Ontario. In addition, we have been found liable in a lawsuit alleging operations at our current and former facilities in Orange County, California contributed to groundwater contamination, and also have ongoing investigation activities at and adjacent to a former facility to determine the extent of any soil, soil vapor, and groundwater contamination. Finally, there are some sites, including our acquired facility in Gunzenhausen, Germany, 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 which are known to have groundwater contamination caused by a third-party, and that third-party has provided indemnification to us for the related liability. However, in certain situations, third-party indemnities may not be effective to reduce our liability for environmental contamination. 
 
 We use environmental consultants primarily for risk assessments and remediation, including remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial action planning and design and site remediation. Our consultants provide information regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, acceptable remediation alternatives and estimated costs associated with each remediation alternative. We consider their recommendations together with other information when determining the appropriate amount to accrue for environmental liabilities. 
 
 Other Regulations 
 
 We are also subject to a number of domestic and foreign regulations relating to our operations worldwide. In particular, our sales activities must comply with restrictions relating to the export of controlled technology and sales to denied or sanctioned parties contained in the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations, U.S. Export Administration Regulations and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Controls of the U.S. Treasury Department. We must also comply with regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts and subcontracts with respect to our defense business, including regulations that govern price negotiations, cost accounting standards, procurement practices, termination at the election of the government and many other aspects of performance under government contracts and subcontracts. These regulations are complex, require extensive compliance efforts and expenditures in the form of additional personnel, systems and processes, and, in some cases, require us to ensure that our suppliers adhere to such regulations. Furthermore, our compliance with these regulations is subject to audit or investigation by governmental authorities and, from time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from government agencies and regulators regarding our compliance. Finally, the design, manufacture and repair of products that we conduct for the medical industry often requires compliance with domestic and foreign regulations, including the Food and Drug Administration s quality system regulations and the European Union s medical device directive. In addition to complying with these standards, our medical facilities comply with ISO 13485 (formerly EN 46002) and ISO 9001, where required. Should we be found to have violated one or more of such regulations, we could become subject to civil damages (which in some cases can be trebled) or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including fines, penalties, appointment of government monitors, termination of our government contracts and, ultimately, debarment from doing further business with the U.S. government. Any of such results would increase our expenses, reduce our revenue and damage our reputation as both a commercial and government supplier. 
 
 Human Capital Resources 
 
 General Information About Our Human Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had approximately 37,000 employees, including 5,000 temporary employees in 21 countries. 
 Region Approximate Breakdown of Employees Americas 58 APAC 32 EMEA 10 Total 100 
 
 Core Principles 
 
 At Sanmina, we believe our employees are the key to our success. We cultivate an agile, innovative workplace culture fueled by collaboration, diversity, equity and inclusion. Having highly engaged employees is essential to our culture and achieving our mission. We embrace diverse perspectives and empower our employees to improve our organization, help us innovate, and continuously strengthen our workplace. 
 
 As a founding member of the RBA, its principles are fundamental to our corporate culture and core values and are reflected in our commitments to our customers, stakeholders, employees and communities in which we do business around the world. We have aligned our work programs, processes and procedures to the RBA Code of Conduct to help ensure a safe and 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 positive work environment for our employees that emphasizes learning and professional development, respect for individuals and ethical conduct, and that is facilitated by a direct management-employee engagement model. 
 
 For over a decade, we have tracked human capital metrics that we consider to be key to our business, including health and safety, career growth and development, turnover, hiring and diversity, equity and inclusion. Management regularly reviews these metrics and seeks to improve them. 
 
 Health and Safety 
 
 The health and safety of our employees is of utmost importance to us. In the U.S., we are subject to the requirements of the United States Department of Labor s OSHA and we are guided by the Environmental Health and Safety principles as described in the RBA s Code of Conduct worldwide. We conduct regular self-assessments and audits to ensure compliance with our health and safety guidelines and regulatory requirements. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a level of work-related injuries as close to zero as possible through continuous investment in our safety programs. We provide protective gear (e.g., eye protection, masks and gloves) as required by applicable standards and as appropriate given employee job duties. 
 
 Career Growth and Development 
 
 We invest resources in professional development and growth as a means of improving employee performance and retaining our employees. We leverage both formal and informal programs, including in-person, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and outside seminars and educational programs, when applicable, to identify, foster, and retain top talent. Employees have access to courses through multiple learning and development platforms. 
 
 Our performance review process is intended to promote transparent communication of team member performance, which we believe is a key factor in our success. Performance reviews enable ongoing assessments, reviews, and mentoring to identify career development and learning opportunities for our employees. 
 
 Turnover 
 
 We continually monitor employee turnover rates, both regionally and as a whole, as our success depends upon retaining our highly trained manufacturing and operating personnel. We believe the combination of competitive compensation, career growth and development opportunities have helped increase employee tenure and reduce voluntary turnover. The average tenure of our employees is approximately eight years and approximately 34 of our employees have been employed by us for more than ten years. 
 
 Hiring Practices 
 
 We recruit the best people for the job without regard to gender, ethnicity or other protected characteristics and it is our policy to comply fully with all domestic, foreign and local laws relating to discrimination in hiring. 
 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
 We are focused on creating a culture of belonging where employees can be their authentic selves and cultivate a workplace where everyone has an opportunity to succeed. Recognizing and respecting our global presence, we strive to maintain a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce everywhere we operate. Approximately 49 of our employees worldwide are female and, in the U.S., non-Caucasian employees account for approximately 60 of the employee base. Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are reflected in our employee training, in particular with respect to our policies against harassment and bullying and the elimination of bias in the workplace. 
 
 Management Engagement Practices 
 
 We believe in a direct management-employee engagement model by which managers and employees maintain a regular dialogue about working conditions, compensation, compliance with laws and applicable standards, safety and advancement opportunities. This model is also reflected in our training and compliance programs, which emphasize the need to report concerns about violations of policy or law. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. In some international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions on either a national or plant level or are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 End Market and Operational Risks 
 
 Adverse changes in the key end markets we target could harm our business by reducing our sales. 
 
 We provide products and services to companies that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud infrastructure industries. Adverse changes in any of these end markets could reduce demand for our customers products or make these customers more sensitive to the cost of our products and services, either of which could reduce our sales, gross margins and net income. A number of factors could affect these industries in general and our customers in particular, leading to reductions in net sales. These factors include: 
 
 intense competition among our customers and their competitors, leading to reductions in prices for their products and increases in pricing pressure placed on us; 
 failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance, which could decrease the volume of orders our customers place with us; 
 changes in regulatory requirements affecting the products we build for our customers, leading to product redesigns or obsolescence and potentially causing us to lose business; and 
 the negative effects of inflation, high interest rates and any potential resultant recession on customers end markets and their demand for our products and services. 
 
 We realize a substantial portion of our revenue from communications equipment customers. This market is highly competitive, particularly in the area of price. Should any of our larger customers in this market fail to effectively compete with their competitors, they could reduce their orders to us or experience liquidity difficulties, either of which could have the effect of substantially reducing our revenue and net income. In addition, recent customer finished goods inventory adjustments reduced demand for our services from this end market, negatively impacting our revenue during fiscal 2024. There can be no assurance when this adjustment will be complete or that we will not experience declines in demand in this or in other end markets in the future. 
 
 Our operating results are subject to significant uncertainties, which can cause our future sales, net income and cash generated from operations to be variable. 
 
 Our operating results can vary due to a number of significant uncertainties, including: 
 
 our ability to replace declining sales from end-of-life programs and customer disengagements with new business wins; 
 conditions in the global economy as a whole and in the industries we serve, which have been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and higher interest rates; 
 fluctuations in component prices, component shortages and extended component lead times caused by high demand and supply chain constraints and disruptions caused by geopolitical events, such as the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, natural disasters or otherwise; 
 timing and success of new product developments and ramps by our customers, which create demand for our services, but which can also require us to incur start-up costs relating to new tooling and processes; 
 levels of demand in the end markets served by our customers and the amount of inventory held by them; 
 timing of orders from customers, the accuracy of their forecasts which drive the amount of components we order and the extent to which customers reschedule or cancel their orders; 
 the extent to which our customers may choose to in-source the manufacturing of their products; 
 our inventory levels, which in the past have been driven higher as a result of supply chain disruptions, with higher levels of inventory reducing our operating cash flow; 
 our customers inventory levels, which, if high, decrease demand for new orders for products; 
 customer payment terms and the extent to which we factor customer receivables during the quarter; 
 increasing labor costs in the regions in which we operate; 
 mix of products ordered by and shipped to major customers, as high volume and low complexity manufacturing services typically have lower gross margins than more complex and lower volume services; 
 our ability to pass tariffs and price increases of components through to our customers; 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 quality or other claims made by our customers; 
 the degree to which we are able to fully utilize our available manufacturing capacity or expand, when necessary to satisfy customer demand; 
 customer insolvencies resulting in bad debt or inventory exposures that are in excess of our reserves; 
 our ability to efficiently move manufacturing operations to lower cost regions when requested by our customers; 
 changes in our tax provision due to changes in our estimates of pre-tax income in the jurisdictions in which we operate, uncertain tax positions and our continued ability to utilize our deferred tax assets; 
 political and economic developments in countries in which we or our customers or our suppliers have operations, which could restrict our operations or those of our suppliers and/or customers or increase our costs; and 
 accuracy of management s estimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs relating to long-term contracts, particularly for new products, as any impact due to changes in estimates must be recognized in the period of change. 
 
 Variability in our operating results may also lead to variability in cash generated by operations, which can adversely affect our ability to make capital expenditures, repurchase stock and engage in strategic transactions. 
 
 We are subject to risks arising from our international operations. 
 
 The substantial majority of our net sales are generated through our non-U.S. operations. As a result, we are or can be negatively impacted by economic, political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which we do business, including: 
 
 changes in trade and tax laws that may result in us or our customers being subject to increased taxes, duties and tariffs and import and export restrictions, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our customers willingness to use our services in countries in which we are currently manufacturing their products; 
 compliance with foreign laws, including labor laws that generally provide for increased notice, severance and consultation requirements compared to U.S. labor laws; 
 labor unrest, including strikes; 
 difficulties in staffing due to immigration or travel restrictions imposed by national governments, including the U.S.; 
 security concerns; 
 political instability and/or regional military tension or hostilities, such as the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, the possibility of such conflicts broadening to areas outside the area of immediate hostilities and the actions taken by national governments in response to such hostilities; 
 fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may either increase or decrease our operating costs and for which we have significant exposure; 
 the imposition of currency controls, which would have the effect of preventing us from repatriating profits from our foreign subsidiaries; 
 exposure to heightened corruption risks; 
 aggressive, selective or lax enforcement of laws and regulations by national governmental authorities; and 
 potentially increased risk of misappropriation of intellectual property. 
 
 We operate in countries that have experienced labor unrest, political instability or conflict and strife in the past, including China, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand, and we have experienced work stoppages and similar disruptions at our plants in these countries. To the extent these factors prevent us from adequately staffing our plants and manufacturing and shipping products in those jurisdictions, our margins and net income could be reduced and our reputation as a reliable supplier could be negatively impacted. 
 
 We rely on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our sales and declines in sales to these customers could significantly reduce our net sales and net income. 
 
 Sales to our ten largest customers have historically represented approximately half of our net sales. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our sales for the foreseeable future. The loss of, a significant reduction in sales or pricing to, or an inability to recover components liabilities from our largest customers could therefore substantially reduce our revenue and margins.

Table of Contents 

 Customer order cancellations, push-outs and reduced forecasts could reduce our sales, net income and liquidity. 
 
 We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers and our bookings may generally be canceled prior to the scheduled shipment date. Although customers are generally liable for components we procure on their behalf, finished goods and work in progress at the time of cancellation, customers may fail to honor this commitment or we may be unable to, or, for other business reasons, choose not to, enforce our contractual rights. Cancellations, reductions or push-outs of orders by customers and reduced customer forecasts, whether due to changes in individual customer circumstances, such as customer inventory levels, or end market changes or recessionary conditions in general, could cause our inventory levels to increase, consume working capital, lead to write-offs of inventory that customers fail to purchase for any reason, which could reduce our sales, net income and liquidity. 
 
 Our strategy to pursue higher margin business depends in part on the success of our CPS businesses, which, if not successful, could cause our future gross margins and operating results to be lower. 
 
 A key part of our strategy of providing end-to-end manufacturing solutions is to grow our CPS businesses, which supplies printed circuit boards, backplane and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts, memory, RF, optical and microelectronic solutions, and data storage solutions and design, engineering, logistics and repair services and our SCI defense and aerospace products. A decrease in orders for these components, products and services can have a disproportionately adverse impact on our profitability since these components, products and services generally yield higher margins than our core IMS business. In addition, in order to grow this portion of our business profitably, we must continue to make substantial investments in the development of our product development capabilities, research and development activities, test and tooling equipment and skilled personnel, all of which reduce our operating results in the short term. The success of our CPS businesses also depends on our ability to increase sales of our proprietary products, convince our customers to purchase our components rather than those of third parties for use in the manufacture of their products, and expand the number of our customers who contract for our design, engineering, logistics and repair services. We may face challenges in achieving commercially viable yields and difficulties in manufacturing components in the quantities and to the specifications and quality standards required by our customers, as well as in qualifying our components for use in our customers designs. Our proprietary products and design, engineering, logistics and repair services must compete with products and services offered by established vendors which focus solely on development of similar technologies or the provision of similar services. Any of these factors could reduce the revenue and margins of our CPS businesses, which in turn would have an adverse and potentially disproportionate effect on our overall revenue and profitability. 
 
 Worldwide supply chain shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the resumption of strong worldwide demand for electronic products and components and geopolitical events have collectively limited our ability to manufacture and ship all of the products for which we have demand; our profitability will be reduced if we are unable to continue to pass on increasing component costs. 
 
 Over the past four years, our supply chain has been significantly impacted by interruptions in supplier and port operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the resumption of strong worldwide demand for electronic products and components following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and geopolitical events, such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. As a result, we have experienced and continue to experience delays in delivery and shortages of certain components, particularly certain types of capacitors, resistors and discrete semiconductors needed for many of the products we manufacture. These conditions have limited and may continue to limit our ability to manufacture and ship all of the products for which we have demand and that require these components and have resulted and may continue to result in an increase in our inventories of other components that cannot be assembled into finished products without these components. These factors are exacerbated by the fact that we are dependent on a limited number of sole source suppliers to provide key components that we incorporate into our products. In the case of semiconductors, most third-party manufacturing is concentrated among a small number of suppliers located in the same geographic area. Although conditions have generally improved, we expect some level of delays and shortages to continue to persist in some form in the short to medium term. Any such delays or shortages, including due to natural disasters or geopolitical issues or conflicts, could result in delays in shipments to our customers, which would reduce our revenue, margins and operating cash flow for the periods affected. 
 
 In addition, inflationary pressures resulting from supply chain constraints and strong economic conditions generally have led to sustained increases in the prices we pay for components and materials used in production and in our labor and transportation costs. While we seek to pass on to our customers the increased prices for components and shipping, plus a margin, our gross margins and profitability could decrease, perhaps significantly, over a sustained period of time if we are unable to do so.

 The COVID-19 pandemic had, and any future outbreak could have, a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition by reducing demand from our customers, interrupting the flow of components needed for our customers products, limiting the operations and productivity of our manufacturing facilities and creating health risks to our employees. 
 
 Our business, operations and results of operations were significantly and negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic 1) caused our customers to reduce their demand from us, 2) interrupted the availability of components we need for our customers products, 3) limited the operations and productivity of our manufacturing resources and 4) created health risks to our employees. 
 
 Our operations could again be similarly and negatively impacted in the event of any future outbreaks, including outbreaks caused by new variants of COVID-19, and actions that government authorities may take in response to such future outbreaks. 
 
 Current U.S. trade policy could increase the cost of using both our onshore and offshore manufacturing services for our U.S. customers, leading them to reduce their orders to us. 
 
 Although we maintain significant manufacturing capacity in the U.S., the majority of our manufacturing operations are located outside the U.S. The U.S., China, the E.U. and several other countries have imposed tariffs on certain imported products. In particular, the U.S. has imposed tariffs impacting certain components and products imported from China by us into the U.S. These tariffs apply to both components imported into the U.S. from China for use in the manufacture of products at our U.S. plants and to certain of our customers products that we manufacture for them in China and that are then imported into the U.S. Any decision by a large number of our customers to cease using our manufacturing services due to the application of tariffs would materially reduce our revenue and net income. Depending on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, a broad increase in tariffs on all imported components is possible. Our gross margins would be reduced in the event we are for any reason unable to pass on any tariffs that we incur to our customers. Although our customers are generally liable for tariffs we pay on their behalf on importation of components used in the manufacture of their products, our gross margins would be reduced in the event we are for any reason unable to recover tariffs or duties from our customers. Further, although we are required to pay tariffs upon importation of the components, we may not be able to recover these amounts from our customers until sometime later, if at all, which would adversely impact our operating cash flow in a given period. 
 
 Transfers of business or operations may increase our costs and cause disruptions in our ability to service our customers. 
 
 Our customers sometimes require that we transfer the manufacturing of their products from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions, tariff reductions and other objectives. These transfers have resulted in increased costs to us due to facility downtime, less than optimal utilization of our manufacturing capacity and delays and complications related to the transition of manufacturing programs to new locations. These transfers, and any decision by a significant customer to terminate manufacturing services in a particular facility, could require us to close or reduce operations at certain facilities and, as a result, we may incur in the future significant costs for the closure of facilities, employee severance and related matters. We may be required to relocate or close additional manufacturing operations in the future and, accordingly, we may incur additional costs that decrease our net income. 
 
 In addition, certain of our foreign manufacturing facilities are leased from third parties. To the extent we are unable to renew the leases covering such facilities as they expire on reasonable terms, or are forced to move our operations at those facilities to other locations as a result of a failure to agree upon renewal terms, production for our customers may be interrupted, we may breach our customer agreements, we could incur significant start-up costs at new facilities and our lease expense may increase, potentially significantly. 
 
 Regulatory, Compliance and Litigation Risks 
 
 We are subject to a number of U.S. export control and regulatory requirements relating to our defense business, with which the failure to comply could result in fines and reduction of future revenue. 
 
 We are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to the export of U.S. technology, anti-corruption and the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts and subcontracts. In particular, our activities must comply with the restrictions relating to the export of controlled technology and sales to denied or sanctioned parties contained in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department. The U.S. Commerce Department has released rules that in some cases significantly restrict the export of U.S. technology to or from China. These laws could negatively impact our operations in China by making it more difficult to import components containing U.S. technology into China and to export finished products 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 containing such components out of China. Any failure to comply with export control laws could result in significant fines or penalties. We must also comply with regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts and subcontracts with respect to our defense business, including regulations that govern price negotiations, cost accounting standards, procurement practices, termination at the election of the government and many other aspects of performance under government contracts and subcontracts. These laws and regulations are complex, require extensive compliance efforts and expenditures in the form of additional systems and personnel, and, in some cases, require us to ensure that our suppliers adhere to such regulations. Furthermore, our compliance with such regulations is subject to audit or investigation by governmental authorities. From time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from government agencies and regulators regarding our compliance. For example, we responded to several Civil Investigative Demands from the U.S. Department of Justice relating to certain contracts, projects, proposals, and business activities of our SCI subsidiary and a qui tam lawsuit filed by a former SCI employee was recently unsealed relating to these matters. Should we be found to have violated one or more government contracting laws or regulations, we could become subject to civil damages (which in some cases could be trebled) or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including appointment of government monitors, termination of our government contracts and, ultimately, debarment from doing further business with the U.S. government. Any of such results would increase our expenses, reduce our revenue and damage our reputation as both a commercial and government supplier. 
 
 If we manufacture or design defective products, if there are manufacturing defects in the components we incorporate into customer products or if our manufacturing processes do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and standards, we could be subject to claims, damages and fines and lose customers. 
 
 We manufacture products to our customers specifications, and in some cases our manufacturing processes and facilities need to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements and standards. For example, many of the medical products that we manufacture, as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them, must comply with standards established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and products we manufacture for the automotive end market are generally subject to the IATF 16949:2016 standard. In addition, our customers products and the manufacturing processes that we use to produce them often are highly complex. As a result, products that we design or manufacture may at times contain design or manufacturing defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or may not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and standards. Finally, customer products can experience quality problems or failures as a result of defects in the components customers specify to be included in the products we manufacture for them. Defects in the products we design or manufacture, even if caused by components specified by the customer, may result in product recalls, warranty claims by customers, including liability for repair costs, delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders. The failure of the products that we design or manufacture or of our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and standards may subject us to legal fines or penalties, cause us to lose business and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing program or facility. In addition, these defects may result in product liability claims against us by third parties. The risk and magnitude of such claims may increase as we continue to expand our presence in the medical and automotive end markets since defects in these types of products can result in death or significant injury to end users of these products. Even when our customers or suppliers are contractually responsible for defects in the design of a product and defects in components used in the manufacture of such products, there is no guarantee that any indemnities provided by such parties will be adequate to cover all damages to which we may become subject or that these parties will have the financial resources to indemnify us for such liabilities, in which case we could be required to expend significant resources to defend ourselves if named in a product liability suit over such defects. 
 
 If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, upon the intellectual property of others, we could be required to pay significant amounts in costs or damages. 
 
 We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights. However, a number of our patents covering certain aspects of our manufacturing processes or products have expired and will continue to expire in the future. Such expirations reduce our ability to assert claims against competitors or others who use or sell similar technology. Any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology. In addition, should a current or former employee use or disclose any of our or our customers proprietary information, we could become subject to legal action by our customers or others, our key technologies could become compromised and our ability to compete could be adversely impacted. 
 
 In addition, we may become involved in administrative proceedings, lawsuits or other proceedings if others allege that the products we manufacture for our customers or our own manufacturing processes and products infringe on their intellectual property rights. If successful, such claims could force our customers and us to stop importing or producing products or components of products that use the challenged intellectual property, to pay up to treble damages and to obtain a license to the 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 relevant technology or to redesign those products or services so as not to use the infringed technology. The costs of defense and potential damages and/or impact on production of patent litigation could be significant and have a materially adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, although our customers typically indemnify us against claims that the products we manufacture for them infringe others intellectual property rights, there is no guaranty that these customers will have the financial resources to stand behind such indemnities should the need arise, nor is there any guarantee that any such indemnity could be fully enforced. We sometimes design products on a contract basis or jointly with our customers. In such situations, we may become subject to claims that products we design infringe third party intellectual property rights and may also be required to indemnify our customer against liability caused by such claims. 
 
 Any of these events could reduce our revenue, increase our costs and damage our reputation with our customers. 
 
 Allegations of failures to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in the payment of significant damages, which would reduce our net income. 
 
 We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, wages and overtime, meal and rest periods, discrimination, harassment, collective bargaining, whistleblowing, classification of employees, privacy and severance payments. We may be required to defend against allegations that we have violated such laws. Allegations that we have violated labor laws could lead to damages being awarded to employees or fines from or settlements with plaintiffs or federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities, the amounts of which could be substantial, and which would reduce our net income. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we paid approximately 4 million in a judicially approved settlement in connection with a lawsuit against us alleging violations of California Labor Code provisions governing overtime, meal and rest periods, wages, wage statements and reimbursements of business expenses, and in fiscal 2024, four putative class actions were filed in California alleging similar violations. 
 
 Cyberattacks and other disruptions of our information technology network and systems could interrupt our operations, lead to loss of our customer and employee data and subject us to damages. 
 
 We rely on internal and cloud-based networks and systems furnished by third parties for worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing, employee payroll and benefits administration and email communications, among other functions. In addition, our 42Q manufacturing execution solutions software used by us and certain of our customers operates in the cloud. Despite our business continuity planning, including maintaining redundant data sites and network availability, both our internal and cloud-based infrastructure may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, performance failures by our IT vendors and similar events. For example, in July 2024, a misconfigured system update initiated by one of our network security vendors caused our worldwide manufacturing operations to be temporarily disrupted. In addition, our systems, like those of other large companies, are regularly subject to third-party hacking attempts. Despite the implementation of numerous network security measures, both our internal and our cloud-based infrastructure may also be vulnerable to such hacking attempts, the installation of computer viruses, malware or similar disruptions either by third parties or employees with access to key IT infrastructure. Cybersecurity attacks can come in many forms, including distributed denial of service attacks, advanced persistent threat, phishing, business email compromise efforts and ransomware attacks. There can be no assurance that a future malware attack or hacking attempt will not be successful in breaching our systems. Hacking, malware and other cybersecurity attacks, if not prevented, could lead to the collection and disclosure of sensitive personal or confidential information relating to our business, customers, employees or others, exposing us to legal liability and causing us to suffer reputational damage. In addition, our SCI defense and aerospace business is subject to U.S. government regulations requiring the safeguarding of certain unclassified government information and to report to the U.S. government certain cyber incidents that affect such information. The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks requires us to continually evaluate new technologies and processes intended to detect and prevent these attacks. Our insurance coverage for cyberattacks is limited. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity measures will be sufficient to protect the data we manage. If we and our cloud infrastructure vendors are not successful in preventing such outages and cyberattacks, our operations could be disrupted, we could incur losses, including losses relating to claims by our customers, employees or privacy regulators relating to loss of personal or confidential business information, the willingness of customers to do business with us may be damaged and, in the case of our defense business, we could be barred from future participation in U.S. government programs. 
 
 Global, national and corporate initiatives addressing climate change could increase our costs. 
 
 Concern over climate change may lead to state, federal and international legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions through incentives, taxes or mandates and there is increased interest generally in voluntary corporate commitments to reduce the generation of greenhouse gases. Collectively, such initiatives and commitments could lead to an increase in both the price of energy and our operating costs. A sustained increase in energy prices for any reason could increase our raw material, components, operations and transportation costs, which we may 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 not be able to pass on to our customers and which would therefore reduce our profitability, as would any increase in operating costs and investments due to our adoption, whether voluntary or mandatory, of measures to reduce our carbon footprint. We could also suffer reputational damage if our sustainability practices are perceived to be inadequate. 
 
 Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws could adversely affect our business by causing us to pay significant amounts for cleanup of hazardous materials or for damages or fines. 
 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, generation, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances and waste in the ordinary course of our manufacturing operations. If we violate environmental laws or if we own or operate, or owned or operated in the past, a site at which we or a predecessor company caused contamination, we may be held liable for damages and the costs of remedial actions. For example, in April 2023, a court issued a ruling finding us and other defendants liable for certain investigation and remediation costs relating to a site owned by a predecessor company in Southern California at which a disposal was alleged to have occurred, which claim has since been settled subject to court approval. Although we estimate and regularly reassess our potential liability with respect to violations or alleged violations and accrue for such liability, our accruals may not be sufficient. Any increase in existing reserves or establishment of new reserves for environmental liability would reduce our net income. Our failure or inability to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could also limit our ability to expand facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with these laws and regulations. 
 
 Partly as a result of certain of our acquisitions, we have incurred liabilities associated with environmental contamination. These liabilities include ongoing investigation and remediation activities at a number of current and former sites. The time required to perform environmental remediation can be lengthy and there can be no assurance that the scope, and therefore cost, of these activities will not increase as a result of the discovery of new contamination or contamination on adjoining landowners properties or the adoption of more stringent regulatory standards covering sites at which we are currently performing remediation activities. 
 
 We cannot assure that past disposal activities will not result in liability that will materially affect us in the future, nor can we provide assurance that we do not have environmental exposures of which we are unaware and which could adversely affect our future operating results. Changes in or restrictions on discharge limits, emissions levels, permitting requirements and material storage or handling could require a higher than anticipated level of remediation activities, operating expenses and capital investment or, depending on the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors, costly plant relocation, any of which would reduce our net income. 
 
 Changes in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations; there are inherent limitations to our system of internal controls; changes in corporate governance requirements, policies and practices may impact our business . 
 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets, liabilities and net income during the reporting period. A change in the facts and circumstances surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact our future operating results. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies. A change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions which are completed before a change is announced. For example, in fiscal 2019, we implemented the new revenue recognition standard, which is complex and requires significant management judgment. Although we believe the judgments we applied in implementation of the new revenue recognition standard are appropriate, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to change our judgments relating to implementation of such standard in the future, whether as a result of new guidance or otherwise. A significant change in our accounting judgments could have a significant impact on our reported revenue, gross profit, assets and liabilities. In general, changes to accounting rules or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business. 
 
 Our system of internal and disclosure controls and procedures was designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives. However, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. As a result, there can be no assurance that our system of internal and disclosure controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors, theft and fraud, or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner. For example, as disclosed in Item 9A of this annual report on Form 10-K, we have identified 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 several material weaknesses relating to the control environment at one of our divisions and a material weakness in our internal controls over accounting for certain payments received for inventory. 
 
 Finally, corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices continue to evolve based upon continuing legislative action, SEC rulemaking and policy positions taken by large institutional stockholders and proxy advisors. As a result, the number of rules, regulations and standards applicable to us may become more burdensome to comply with, could increase scrutiny of our practices and policies by these or other groups and increase our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time management must devote to governance and compliance activities. For example, the SEC has recently adopted rules requiring that issuers provide significantly increased disclosures concerning cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and incident reporting and adopt more stringent executive compensation clawback policies and several agencies and governments, including the SEC, the EU and California have enacted legislation or adopted rules that will require large companies to provide significant disclosures concerning their greenhouse gas emissions and financial risks relating to climate change. Increasing regulatory burdens and corporate governance requirements impose both internal and external costs on us, require significant management attention and oversight and could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors and qualified executive officers. 
 
 Liquidity and Credit Risks 
 
 Our customers could experience credit problems, which could reduce our future revenue and net income. 
 
 Certain of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties in the past, with a few filing for bankruptcy. Financial difficulties experienced by one or more of our customers, could negatively affect our business by decreasing demand from such customers and through the potential inability of these companies to make full payment on amounts owed to us. Customer bankruptcies also entail the risk of potential recovery by the bankruptcy estate of amounts previously paid to us that are deemed a preference under bankruptcy laws. There can be no assurance that additional customers will not declare bankruptcy or suffer financial distress, in which case our future revenue, net income and cash flow could be reduced. 
 
 We may be unable to generate sufficient liquidity to maintain or expand our operations, which would reduce the amount of business our customers and vendors are able to do with us and impact our ability to continue operations at current levels without seeking additional funding; high interest rates reduce our net income and operating cash flow; we could experience losses if one or more financial institutions holding our cash or other financial counterparties were to fail; repatriation of foreign cash could increase our taxes. 
 
 Our liquidity is dependent on a number of factors, including profitability, business volume, inventory levels, the extension of trade credit by our suppliers, the degree of alignment of payment terms from our suppliers with payment terms granted to our customers, the amount we invest in our facilities and equipment, the timing of acquisitions and divestitures, the schedule for repayment of our outstanding indebtedness, the timing of stock repurchases, the amount available to borrow under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2022, as amended (the Credit Agreement ), and the amount of accounts receivable eligible and accepted for sale under our factoring programs. In the event we need or desire additional liquidity beyond the sources described above to maintain or expand our business levels, make acquisitions or repurchase stock, there can be no assurance that such additional liquidity will be available on acceptable terms or at all. The sale of receivables under our factoring programs is subject to the approval of the banks or customers involved and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell the maximum amount of receivables permitted by these programs when desired. In addition, because the interest rate we pay for borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the interest rate used to calculate the purchase price for receivables under our factoring programs are variable, the currently high interest rates resulting from actions taken by the Federal Reserve to reduce inflation both increases the amount of interest expense we pay, which reduces net income, and also reduces the amount of proceeds we receive from purchasers under our receivables factoring program, which reduces operating cash flow. 
 
 Any failure to maintain adequate liquidity would prevent us from maintaining operations at current or desired levels, which in turn would reduce both our revenue and profitability. 
 
 Although we believe our existing cash resources and sources of liquidity, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, should demand for our services increase significantly over the next 12 months or should we experience significant increases in delinquent or uncollectible accounts receivable for any reason, including recessionary economic conditions, our cash provided by operations 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 could decrease significantly and we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity to continue our operations at their current level. In such a case, there can be no assurance that such additional sources of financing would be available. 
 
 A principal source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents, which are held with various financial institutions. Although we distribute such funds among a number of financial institutions that we believe to be of high quality, there can be no assurance that one or more of such institutions will not become insolvent in the future. For example, in the spring of 2023, three mid-sized regional banks failed and were placed under the temporary control of federal regulators. Although none of our cash and cash equivalents were deposited with any of such banks, should the financial institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are deposited fail in the future and not be backstopped by the federal government or otherwise guaranteed, all or a portion of our uninsured funds on deposit with such institutions could be lost. Similarly, should the financial institutions holding the cash and cash equivalents of our customers fail and not be backstopped or otherwise guaranteed, our customers may become unable to satisfy their obligations to us. Finally, if one or more counterparties to our interest rate or foreign currency hedging instruments were to fail, we could suffer losses and our hedging of risk could become less effective. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, approximately 65 of our cash was held in foreign jurisdictions. Some of these jurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the U.S. or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is needed by, our U.S. operations, we may incur significant foreign taxes to repatriate these funds which would reduce the net amount ultimately available for such purposes. 
 
 Our Credit Agreement contains covenants that may adversely impact our business; the failure to comply with such covenants or the occurrence of an event of default could cause us to be unable to borrow additional funds and cause our outstanding debt to become immediately payable. 
 
 Our Credit Agreement contains a maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratio and a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making investments and other restricted payments, selling assets and paying dividends, subject to certain exceptions, with which we must comply. Collectively, these covenants could constrain our ability to grow our business through acquisition or engage in other strategic transactions. Such facility also contains customary events of default. Finally, such facility includes covenants requiring, among other things, that we timely file quarterly and annual financial statements with the SEC, comply with all laws, pay all taxes and maintain casualty insurance. If we are not able to comply with these covenants or if an event of default were to occur and not be cured or waived by our lenders, all of our outstanding debt would become immediately due and payable and the incurrence of additional debt under our Credit Agreement would not be allowed, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to continue to conduct our business. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 
 We are subject to intense competition in the electronics manufacturing services EMS industry, which could cause us to lose sales and, therefore, harm our financial performance. 
 
 The EMS industry is highly competitive and the industry has experienced a surplus of manufacturing capacity. Our competitors include major global EMS providers, including Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Celestica, Inc., Flex Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (Foxconn), Jabil Inc. and Plexus Corp., as well as other companies that have a regional, product, service or industry-specific focus. We also face competition from current and potential OEM customers who may elect to manufacture their own products internally rather than outsource to EMS providers. 
 
 Competition is based on a number of factors, including end markets served, price and quality. We may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our competitors for any number of reasons, including the willingness of competitors to provide EMS services at prices we are unable or unwilling to offer. There can be no assurance that we will win new business or maintain existing business due to competitive factors, which could decrease our sales and net income. In addition, due to the extremely price sensitive nature of our industry, business that we do win or maintain may have lower margins than our historical or target margins. As a result, competition may cause our gross and operating margins to fall. 
 
 Consolidation in the electronics industry may adversely affect our business by increasing customer buying power and increasing prices we pay for components. 
 
 Consolidation in the electronics industry among our customers, our suppliers and/or our competitors may increase, which could result in a small number of very large electronics companies offering products in multiple sectors of the electronics 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 industry. If one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide EMS services, we may lose that customer s business. Similarly, consolidation among our suppliers could result in a sole or limited source for certain components used in our customers products. Any such consolidation could cause us to be required to pay increased prices for such components, which could reduce our gross margin and profitability if we are unable to pass on the corresponding cost to our customers. 
 
 Changes in our income tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities or expiration of our net operating loss carryforwards could increase our taxes and decrease our net income; developments in pending audits could result in an increase in our tax expenses which would decrease our net income. 
 
 We are or may become subject to income, sales, value-added, goods and services, withholding and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for taxes and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective income tax rates and liability for other taxes could increase as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in enacted tax laws, the effectiveness of our cash and tax management strategies, our ability to negotiate advance pricing agreements with foreign tax authorities, compliance with local trade laws and other factors. International initiatives require multinational enterprises, like ours, to report profitability on a country-by-country basis, which could increase scrutiny by foreign tax authorities. In addition, our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities. For example, we are currently undergoing audits of our tax returns for certain recent tax years in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States. In connection with one such audit, on November 17, 2023, we received a Revenue Agent s Report RAR from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ), which asserted an underpayment of tax of approximately 8 million for fiscal 2009. The proposed underpayment results from the IRS s proposed disallowance of a 503 million worthless stock deduction previously taken by us. We disagree with the IRS s position as asserted in the RAR and are vigorously contesting this matter through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. However, an adverse result in this matter or additional developments in these or future audits would adversely affect our tax provisions, including through the disallowance or reduction of deferred tax assets or the assessment of back taxes, interest and penalties, any of which could result in a material increase to our income tax expense and therefore a material decrease in our net income and could have a material adverse impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Further, as of September 28, 2024, we have cumulative net operating loss carryforwards NOLs for state and foreign tax purposes of 255 million and 446 million, respectively, and none for federal. The state NOLs begin expiring in fiscal 2025, and expire at various dates through September 26, 2043. Certain foreign NOLs begin expiring in fiscal 2025. When our NOLs expire, our state income tax rates will increase, which will reduce our net income. 
 
 We can experience losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls, which could reduce our net income and impact our ability to repatriate funds. 
 
 Because we manufacture the majority of our products abroad, our operating results can be negatively impacted due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We use financial instruments, primarily short-term foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. However, the success of our foreign currency hedging activities in preventing foreign exchange losses depends largely upon the accuracy of our forecasts of future sales, expenses, capital expenditures and assets and liabilities. As such, our foreign currency hedging program may not fully cover all of our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. If our hedging activities are not successful, our net income may be reduced. In addition, certain countries in which we operate have adopted currency controls requiring that local transactions be settled only in local currency rather than in our functional currency, which is generally different than the local currency. Such controls could require us to hedge larger amounts of local currency than we otherwise would and/or prevent us from repatriating cash generated by our operations in such countries. 
 
 We may not have sufficient insurance coverage for potential claims and losses, which could leave us responsible for certain costs and damages. 
 
 We carry various forms of business and liability insurance in types and amounts we believe are reasonable and customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, our insurance program does not generally cover losses due to failure to comply with typical customer warranties for workmanship, product and medical device liability, intellectual property infringement, product recall claims, or environmental contamination. In particular, our insurance coverage with respect to damages to or closure of our facilities, or damages to our customers products caused by cyberattacks, outages and certain natural disasters, such as earthquakes, epidemics and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), is limited and is subject to policy deductibles, coverage limits, and exclusions, and as a result, may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses. For example, our policies have very limited coverage for damages due to earthquakes or losses caused by business disruptions. In addition, such coverage may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. Our policies generally 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 have deductibles and/or limits or may be limited to certain lines or business or customer engagements that reduce the amount of our potential recoveries from insurance. As a result, not all of our potential business losses are covered under our insurance policies. Should we sustain a significant uncovered loss, our net income will be reduced. Additionally, if one or more counterparties to our insurance coverage were to fail, we would bear the entire amount of an otherwise insured loss. 
 
 Recruiting and retaining our key personnel is critical to the continued growth of our business. 
 
 Our success depends upon the continued service of our key personnel, particularly our highly skilled sales and operations executives, managers and engineers with many years of experience in the EMS industry. Such individuals can be difficult to identify, recruit and retain and are heavily recruited by our competitors. As our key employees choose to retire or terminate their employment with us, we will be required to replace them with new employees with the required experience, which has become challenging in the U.S. due to the strong employment market. Should we be unable to recruit new employees to fill key positions with us, our operations and growth prospects could be negatively impacted. 
 
 We may not be successful in implementing and integrating strategic transactions or in divesting assets or businesses, which could harm our operating results; we could become required to book a charge to earnings should we determine that goodwill and other acquired assets are impaired. 
 
 From time to time, we may undertake strategic transactions that give us the opportunity to access new customers and new end markets, increase our proprietary product offerings, obtain new manufacturing and service capabilities and technologies, enter new geographic manufacturing locations, lower our manufacturing costs, increase our margins or further develop existing customer relationships. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into a joint venture with a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited RSBVL that is intended to create a world-class electronic manufacturing hub in India. The success of this joint venture is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the joint venture obtaining Trusted Source designation under the India government s Make in India initiative, adverse changes in the key markets the joint venture targets and the risks described above under the caption We are subject to risks arising from our international operations . Strategic transactions involve a number of risks, uncertainties and costs, including integrating acquired operations and workforce, businesses and products, resolving quality issues involving acquired products, incurring severance and other restructuring costs, diverting management attention from their normal operational duties, maintaining customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations, terminating unfavorable commercial arrangements, losing key employees, integrating the systems of acquired operations into our management information systems and satisfying the liabilities of acquired businesses, including liability for past violations of law and material environmental liabilities. Any of these risks could cause our strategic transactions not to be ultimately profitable. We may also choose to divest plants, businesses or products lines in the future. Divestitures reduce revenue and, potentially, margins and can involve the risk of retained liabilities from the operations divested, including environmental liabilities. 
 
 In addition, we have in the past recorded, and may be required to record in the future, goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions. We evaluate, at least on an annual basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable. Should we determine in the future that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired, an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary, which could be significant. For example, during our fiscal 2018 annual goodwill impairment analysis, we fully impaired goodwill of 31 million associated with the acquisition of a storage software business we purchased in 2016. 
 
 We are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events. 
 
 Our activities, including manufacturing, administration and information technology management, can be adversely affected by natural disasters such as major earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, tornadoes, fires and epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate change may cause certain of these events to become more severe and therefore more damaging. In the event of a major natural disaster affecting one or more of our facilities, our operations and management information systems, which control our worldwide procurement, inventory management, shipping and billing activities, could be significantly disrupted. Such events could delay or prevent product manufacturing for an extended period of time. Any extended inability to continue our operations at affected facilities following such an event could reduce our revenue. Further, geopolitical events like the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East may also impact our operations by affecting our supply chain or impacting our plants located in the region of instability.

 Overview 
 
 We are a leading global provider of integrated manufacturing solutions, components, products and repair, logistics and after-market services. Our revenue is generated from sales of our products and services primarily to original equipment manufacturers OEMs that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud solutions industries. 
 
 Our operations are managed as two businesses: 
 
 1) Integrated Manufacturing Solutions IMS ). Our IMS segment consists of printed circuit board assembly and test, high-level assembly and test and direct-order-fulfillment. 
 
 2) Components, Products and Services CPS ). Components include advanced printed circuit boards, backplanes and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include optical, radio frequency RF and microelectronic design and manufacturing services from our Advanced Microsystems Technologies division; multi-chip package memory solutions from our Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from our Viking Enterprise Solutions division; defense and aerospace product, design, manufacturing, repair and refurbishment services from our SCI Technology Inc. SCI subsidiary; and cloud-based smart manufacturing execution software from our 42Q division. Services include design, engineering, and logistics and repair. 
 
 Our only reportable segment for financial reporting purposes is IMS, which represented approximately 80 of our total revenue in 2024. Our CPS business consists of multiple operating segments which do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for being presented as reportable segments. Therefore, financial information for these operating segments is combined and presented in a single category entitled CPS .

Our strategy is to leverage our comprehensive product and service offerings, advanced technologies and global capabilities to further penetrate diverse end markets that we believe offer significant growth opportunities and have complex products that require higher value-added services. We believe this strategy differentiates us from our competitors and will help drive more sustainable revenue growth and provide opportunities for us to achieve operating margins that exceed industry standards. 
 
 A core component of our business strategy is to establish and retain long-term customer partnerships with companies. Historically, we have had substantial recurring sales to existing customers. Sales to our ten largest customers typically represent approximately 50 of our net sales in any given year. 
 
 We typically enter into supply agreements with our major OEM customers. These agreements generally have terms ranging from three to five years and cover the manufacture of a range of products. Under these agreements, a customer typically purchases its requirements for specific products in particular geographic areas from us. However, these agreements generally do not obligate the customer to purchase minimum quantities of products. In addition, some customer contracts contain cost reduction objectives, which can have the effect of reducing revenue from such customers. 
 
 We generate about 80 of our net sales from products manufactured in our foreign operations. The concentration of foreign operations has resulted primarily from a desire on the part of many of our customers to manufacture in lower-cost locations in regions such as Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe and we plan to expand our presence as appropriate to meet the needs of our customers. We also intend to continue to invest in factory automation, process improvements, robotics and artificial intelligence, keeping up with the trends in technology to further enhance our efficiency output. 
 
 Trends and Uncertainties 
 
 We believe our end-to-end manufacturing solutions combined with our global supply chain management expertise differentiates us from our competitors and enables us to better serve the needs of OEMs. However, our business faces many challenges. For example, we compete with a number of companies in each of our key end markets. This includes companies that are much larger than we are and smaller companies that focus on a particular niche product, service or end market. Although we believe we are well-positioned in each of our key end markets and offer many advantages compared to our competitors, competition remains intense and profitably growing our revenues has been challenging. Additionally, we are impacted by macroeconomic challenges such as inflation, supply chain constraints, foreign currency fluctuations, high interest rates, market volatility, recession concerns, tariffs and other factors that have been and could be in the future exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and results of the U.S. presidential election. Although supply chain constraints have been easing, we expect headwinds to our revenue growth that will continue in 2025 due to customers absorbing their finished goods inventory in some of our end markets. 
 
 Despite these challenges, we remain focused on improving our operations, building flexibility and efficiencies in our processes and adjusting our business models to changing circumstances. We intend to continue diversifying into mission critical markets and creating a portfolio of more complex, higher technology products with longer product life cycles. As our end markets evolve and grow, our ability to optimize our product and portfolio mix towards higher value opportunities will continue to be an important driver for our business going forward.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). We review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the process used to develop estimates related to accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, environmental matters, litigation and other contingencies, as well as estimates related to costs expected to be incurred to satisfy performance obligations under long-term contracts and variable consideration related to such contracts. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We have considered information available to us as of the date of issuance of these financial statements and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that would require an update to our estimates or judgments, or a revision to the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. Our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
 
 We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used by us in preparing our consolidated financial statements: 
 
 Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue for the majority of our contracts on an over time basis. This is primarily due to the fact that we do not have an alternative use for the end products we manufacture for our customers and have an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit, for work in progress upon a customer's cancellation of a contract for convenience. In certain circumstances, we recognize over time because our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our services or, our customer controls the end product as we perform manufacturing services (continuous transfer of control). For these contracts, revenue is recognized on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion) which we believe best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. 
 
 In our Defense and Aerospace division, we apply the cost-to-cost method for government contracts which requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs included in the total estimated costs at completion. Additionally, we evaluate whether contract modifications for claims have been approved and, if so, estimate the amount, if any, of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price of the contract. 
 
 Estimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs expected to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation are updated on a quarterly basis. These estimates consider costs incurred to date and estimated costs to be incurred over the remaining expected period of performance to satisfy a performance obligation. There is inherent uncertainty in estimating the amount of costs that will be required to complete a contract. Factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in estimates include, among others, (1) the long-term duration of contracts, (2) the highly-complex nature of the products we manufacture, (3) the readiness of our customer s design for manufacturing, (4) the cost and availability of purchased materials, (5) labor cost, availability and productivity, (6) subcontractor performance and (7) the risk of delayed performance/completion. Therefore, such estimates are reviewed each quarter by a group of employees that includes representatives from numerous functions such as engineering, materials, contracts, manufacturing, program management, finance and senior management. If a change in estimate is deemed necessary, the impact of the change is recognized in the period of change. Additionally, contract modifications for claims are assessed each quarter to determine whether the claims have been approved. If it is determined that a claim has been approved, the amount of the claim, if any, that can be included in transaction price is estimated considering a number of factors such as the length of time expected to lapse until uncertainty about the claim has been resolved and the extent to which our experience with claims for similar contracts has predictive value. 
 
 Changes in our estimates of transaction price and/or costs to complete result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to revenue and operating income. The impact of changes in estimates on revenue and operating income resulting from application of the cost-to-cost method for recognizing revenue was as follows: 
 Year Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Revenue: (In thousands) Favorable 12,220 6,023 5,403 Unfavorable (2,697) (2,556) (162) Total 9,523 3,467 5,241

Table of Contents 

 Year Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Operating Income: (In thousands) Favorable 21,229 8,657 7,025 Unfavorable (16,102) (44,838) (20,737) Total 5,127 (36,181) (13,712) 
 
 For contracts for which revenue is required to be recognized at a point-in-time, we recognize revenue when we have transferred control of the related goods, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer. Revenue streams for which revenue is recognized at a point-in-time include our proprietary products and sales of raw materials. 
 
 Inventories We state inventories at the lower of cost (based on standard cost, which approximates first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Cost includes raw materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. We regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and make provisions to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. The ultimate realization of inventory carrying amounts is affected by changes in customer demand for inventory that customers are not contractually obligated to purchase and inventory held for specific customers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Inventory write-downs are recorded based on forecasted demand, past experience with specific customers, the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or return inventories to our suppliers, and whether customers are contractually obligated and have the ability to pay for the related inventory. Certain payments received from customers for inventories that have not been shipped to customers or otherwise disposed of are netted against inventory. 
 
 We generally procure inventory based on specific customer orders and forecasts. Customers generally have limited rights of modification (for example, rescheduling or cancellations) with respect to specific orders. Customer modifications of orders affecting inventory previously procured by us and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs may result in excess and obsolete inventory. Although we may be able to use some excess inventory for other products we manufacture, a portion of this excess inventory may not be returnable to vendors or recoverable from customers. Write-offs or write-downs of inventory could be caused by: 
 
 changes in customer demand for inventory, such as cancellation of orders, and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs that result in excess quantities on hand that we are not able to return to the vendor, use to fulfill orders from other customers or charge back to the customer; 
 financial difficulties experienced by specific customers for whom we hold inventory; and 
 declines in the market value of inventory. 
 
 Our raw materials inventories are generally acquired in anticipation of specific customer orders and pursuant to customer-specific design specifications. When we and our customers agree that the quantity of customer-specific inventory is in excess of anticipated demand, we may transfer control of those inventories to our customers in exchange for a cash payment. These transactions are reported as transfers of non-financial assets i.e., reported on a net basis in the income statement. 
 
 Long-lived Assets We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An asset group is the unit of accounting that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. An asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If an asset or asset group is considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. For asset groups for which a building is the primary asset, we estimate fair value primarily based on data provided by commercial real estate brokers. For other assets, we estimate fair value based on projected discounted future net cash flows, which requires significant judgment. 
 
 Consolidation In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ), we consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In fiscal 2023, we completed a joint venture transaction with Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited RSBVL to establish Sanmina SCI India Private Limited SIPL ), our existing Indian manufacturing entity, as a joint venture. As a result of the transaction, RSBVL holds 50.1 of the outstanding shares of SIPL and we hold the remaining 49.9 of the outstanding shares of SIPL. In connection with RSBVL s investment, we entered into a management services contract pursuant to which we have the unilateral ability to make the significant financial and operating decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL s business. We determined the voting interest model was applicable under ASC 810 and 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 concluded that, despite not having a majority ownership interest, we have a controlling financial interest in SIPL through the management services contract. Therefore, we have, by contract, the unilateral ability to control the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL s business and, as such, we consolidate SIPL. However, we periodically assess whether any changes in facts and circumstances have occurred that could require us to deconsolidate SIPL. 
 
 Income Taxes We estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. Although we believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate, tax regulations are subject to interpretation and the tax controversy process is inherently lengthy and uncertain; therefore, our assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. To the extent the probable tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. We only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold of being upheld. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense. 
 
 We must also make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. We evaluate positive and negative evidence each reporting period when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if we believe realization of such assets is not more likely than not. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, new or modified tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently our estimates, change in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. 
 
 Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the amount and geographic distribution of our worldwide income or losses, the tax regulations, rates and holidays in each geographic region, the utilization of net operating losses, the availability of tax credits and carryforwards, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.

 Results of Operations 
 
 Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on November 16, 2023 for discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended October 1, 2022. 
 
 The following table presents our key operating results. 
 Year Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 (In thousands) Net sales 7,568,328 8,935,048 7,919,622 Gross profit 640,429 743,211 622,206 Gross margin 8.5 8.3 7.9 Operating expenses 304,935 287,553 272,727 Operating income 335,494 455,658 349,479 Operating margin 4.4 5.1 4.4 Net income attributable to common shareholders 222,536 309,970 240,384 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 Net sales decreased from 8.9 billion for 2023 to 7.6 billion for 2024, a decrease of 15.3 . Net sales increased from 7.9 billion for 2022 to 8.9 billion for 2023, an increase of 12.8 . Sales by end market were as follows: 
 Year Ended 2024 vs. 2023 
 2023 vs. 2022 
 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Industrial, Medical, Defense and Aerospace, and Automotive 4,915,880 5,388,877 4,744,088 (472,997) (8.8) 644,789 13.6 Communications Networks and Cloud Infrastructure 2,652,448 3,546,171 3,175,534 (893,723) (25.2) 370,637 11.7 Total 7,568,328 8,935,048 7,919,622 (1,366,720) (15.3) 1,015,426 12.8 
 
 Comparison of 2024 to 2023 by End Market 
 
 The decrease in sales was primarily due to reduced demand caused by customers in some end markets, particularly communications networks, making adjustments to absorb their finished goods inventory. The impact of this was partially offset by new program wins and program ramps in our automotive and communications networks end markets. 
 
 Gross Margin 
 
 Gross margin was 8.5 , 8.3 and 7.9 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. IMS gross margin decreased slightly to 7.5 in 2024 from 7.7 in 2023. CPS gross margin increased to 12.8 in 2024 from 11.6 in 2023, primarily due to significant losses recognized on certain fixed-price customer contracts in 2023 compared to 2024, the effect of which was partially offset by unfavorable product mix. 
 
 We have experienced fluctuations in gross margin in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Fluctuations in our gross margin may be caused by a number of factors, including: 
 
 the impacts of supply chain constraints on our operations, the operations of our suppliers and on our customers businesses; 
 capacity utilization which, if lower, results in lower margins due to fixed costs being absorbed by lower volumes; 
 changes in the mix of high and low margin products demanded by our customers; 
 38

 competition in the EMS industry and pricing pressures from OEMs due to greater focus on cost reduction; 
 the amount of our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, including those associated with distressed customers; 
 levels of operational efficiency and production yields; 
 our performance on long-term contracts, including our ability to recover claims for cost overruns; and 
 our ability to transition the location of and ramp up manufacturing and assembly operations when requested by a customer in a timely and cost-effective manner. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 266 million, 255 million and 245 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 3.5 , 2.9 and 3.1 for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars in 2024 from 2023 was primarily due to higher stock compensation expense from new equity grants, higher variable compensation and an increase in deferred compensation caused by strong stock market performance that increased the market value of participant investment accounts, partially offset by lower professional fees. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses were 29 million, 26 million and 21 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses were 0.4 for 2024 and 0.3 for 2023 and 2022. The increase in absolute dollars in 2024 from 2023 was primarily due to higher expenses for design and engineering support for existing and new projects. 
 
 Other Expense 
 
 Other expense was 1 million in 2024, 20 million in 2023 and a 26 million in 2022. The decrease in other expense in 2024 was primarily caused by a 12 million decrease in discount of sold receivables in 2024 due to significantly lower factoring levels and an incremental gain of 5 million in the market value of participant investment accounts in our deferred compensation plan. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 We recorded income tax expense of 80 million, 85 million and 62 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 25 , 21 and 20 for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The tax rate was lower in 2023 and 2022 primarily due to larger discrete items, including recognized tax benefits from the release of certain foreign tax reserves due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations. 
 
 As a result of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service IRS for fiscal 2008 through 2010, we received a Revenue Agent s Report RAR on November 17, 2023 asserting an underpayment of tax of approximately 8 million for fiscal 2009. The asserted underpayment results from the IRS s proposed disallowance of a 503 million worthless stock deduction in fiscal 2009. Such disallowance, if upheld, would reduce our available net operating loss carryforwards and result in additional tax and interest attributable to fiscal 2021 and later years, which could be material. We disagree with the IRS s position as asserted in the RAR and are vigorously contesting this matter through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. We do not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with any certainty the timing of such resolution. Although the final resolution of this matter remains uncertain, we continue to believe that it is more likely than not our tax position will be sustained. However, an unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD ), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 . Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax and where enacted, the rules begin to be effective for us in fiscal 2025. The Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of the future minimum tax. The adoption and effective dates of these rules may vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. We do not expect any material impact from these tax law changes in fiscal 2025.

 (3) Inventory turns (annualized) (a measure of how quickly we sell inventory) are calculated as the ratio of four times our cost of sales for the quarter to average inventory. 
 
 (4) Days inventory on hand (a measure of how quickly we turn inventory into sales) is calculated as the ratio of average inventory for the quarter to average daily cost of sales for the quarter. 
 
 (5) Accounts payable days (a measure of how quickly we pay our suppliers), or DPO , is calculated as the ratio of 365 days to accounts payable turns, in which accounts payable turns is calculated as the ratio of four times our cost of sales for the quarter to average accounts payable. 
 
 (6) Cash cycle days (a measure of how quickly we convert investments in inventory to cash) is calculated as days inventory on hand plus days sales outstanding minus accounts payable days. 
 
 Certain prior period ratios reflect immaterial updates due to reclassifications of certain financial statement amounts to conform to the current period presentation. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 626 million at September 28, 2024 and 668 million at September 30, 2023. Our cash levels vary during any given period depending on the timing of collections from customers and payments to suppliers, borrowings under credit facilities, sales of accounts receivable under numerous programs we utilize, repurchases of capital stock and other factors. Our working capital was approximately 1.9 billion and 1.8 billion as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 340 million, 235 million and 331 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our working capital metrics tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on factors such as the linearity of our 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 shipments to customers and purchases from suppliers, customer and supplier mix, and payment terms with customers and suppliers. These fluctuations can significantly affect our cash flows from operating activities. 
 
 During 2024, we generated 447 million of cash from earnings, excluding non-cash items, and used 107 million of cash primarily because of a decrease in accounts payable of 112 million, an increase in accrued liabilities of 12 million and an increase in accounts receivable of 104 million, partially offset by a decrease in inventories of 36 million. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily attributable to an unfavorable mix of supplier payment terms and lower inventory receipts, resulting in DPO decreasing from 80 days in 2023 to 71 days in 2024. The increase in accrued liabilities was due primarily to customer payments for certain inventory partially offset by a decrease in amounts collected under our accounts receivable factoring program that had not been remitted as of the end of the period to the financial institutions that purchased the receivables. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to unfavorable customer payment terms mix. The decrease in inventories is primarily due to our ongoing efforts to reduce inventory to more appropriate levels primarily by working with customers to ensure their demand forecasts are reasonable and incorporate appropriate lead times to secure materials. 
 
 During 2023, we generated 527 million of cash from earnings, excluding non-cash items, and used 292 million of cash primarily because of a decrease in accounts payable of 418 million and an increase in accounts receivable of 89 million, partially offset by a decrease in inventories of 210 million. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily attributable to lower inventory receipts and an unfavorable mix of supplier payment terms, resulting in DPO decreasing from 90 days in 2022 to 80 days in 2023. The decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower business volume and our efforts to reduce inventory to more appropriate levels primarily by working with customers to ensure their demand forecasts are reasonable and incorporate appropriate lead times to secure materials. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to higher business volume and unfavorable customer payment terms mix. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 114 million, 192 million and 132 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, we used 111 million and 191 million, respectively, of cash for capital expenditures. 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was (270) million, 95 million and (314) million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2024, we repurchased 254 million of common stock (including 26 million in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations), repaid an aggregate of 22 million of long-term debt and received 6 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock pursuant to stock option exercises. In 2023, we repurchased 107 million of common stock (including 23 million in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations), repaid an aggregate of 18 million of long-term debt, paid a final payment of 9 million in connection with a previous business combination, received 216 million from sale of shares of SIPL to RSBVL and received 8 million proceeds from short-term borrowing. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility. The Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2022, as amended, (the Credit Agreement ), provides for an 800 million revolving credit facility and a 350 million secured term loan (the Term Loan Due 2027 ), together with an accordion feature by which we can obtain, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions and commitment of the lenders, additional revolving commitments in an aggregate amount of up to 200 million. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, no borrowings and 14 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, under which 786 million was available to borrow. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Short-term Borrowing Facilities. We had no short-term borrowings outstanding as of September 28, 2024 and 8 million of short-term borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries had a total of 71 million of short-term borrowing facilities available, under which no borrowings were outstanding as of September 28, 2024. Some of these facilities expire at various dates through the second quarter of 2025 and are expected to be renewed. 
 
 Other Liquidity Matters 
 
 During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 4.0 million shares and 1.6 million shares of our common stock for 227 million and 84 million (including commissions), respectively, under stock repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. These programs have no expiration dates and the timing of repurchases will depend upon capital needs to support the growth of our business, market conditions and other factors. Although stock repurchases are intended to increase stockholder value, purchases of shares reduce our liquidity. As a result, the timing of future repurchases depends upon our future capital needs, market conditions and other factors. As of September 28, 2024, an aggregate of 53 million remains available under these programs.

 We are party to a Receivables Purchase Agreement (the RPA with certain third-party banking institutions for the sale of accounts receivable generated from sales to certain customers. The amount available under the RPA is uncommitted and, as such, is available at the discretion of our third-party banking institutions. Under the Credit Agreement, the percentage of our total accounts receivable that can be sold and outstanding at any time is 50 . Therefore, as of September 28, 2024, a maximum of 490 million of sold receivables could be outstanding at any point in time under this program, as amended, as required by our Credit Agreement. Accounts receivables sold pursuant to the RPA are serviced by us. 
 
 In addition to the RPA, we participate in accounts receivable sales programs that have been implemented by certain of our customers, as in effect from time to time. We do not service accounts receivable sold under these other programs. 
 
 The sale of receivables under all of these programs is subject to the approval of the banks or customers involved and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell the maximum amount of receivables permitted by these programs when desired. 
 
 Under each of the programs noted above, we sell our entire interest in an accounts receivable for 100 of face value, less a discount. For the years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we sold approximately 1.1 billion and 2.6 billion, respectively, of accounts receivable under these programs. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 34 million and 162 million, respectively, of accounts receivable sold under the RPA and subject to servicing by us remained outstanding and had not yet been collected. Our sole risk with respect to receivables we service is with respect to commercial disputes regarding such receivables. Commercial disputes include billing errors, returns and similar matters. To date, we have not been required to repurchase any receivable we have sold due to a commercial dispute. Additionally, we are required to remit amounts collected as servicer on a weekly basis to the financial institutions that purchased the receivables. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 3 million and 33 million, respectively, had been collected but not yet remitted. This amount is classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 We enter into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in Secured Overnight Financing Rate benchmark interest rate associated with anticipated variable rate borrowings. See Note 5 Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for details. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are or may become party to legal proceedings, claims and other contingencies, including environmental, warranty and employee matters and examinations by government agencies. As of September 28, 2024, we had accrued liabilities of 39 million related to such matters. We cannot accurately predict the outcome of these matters or the amount or timing of cash flows that may be required to defend ourselves or to settle such matters or that these reserves will be sufficient to fully satisfy our contingent liabilities. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had a liability of 57 million for uncertain tax positions. Our estimate of liabilities for uncertain tax positions is based on a number of subjective assessments, including the likelihood of a tax obligation being assessed, the amount of taxes (including interest and penalties) that would ultimately be payable, and our ability to settle any such obligations on favorable terms. Therefore, the amount of future cash flows associated with uncertain tax positions may be significantly higher or lower than our recorded liability and we are unable to reliably estimate when cash settlement may occur. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by approximately 8 million due to payments, the resolution of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations. In addition, there could be a corresponding decrease in accrued interest and penalties of approximately 2 million. 
 
 Our liquidity is largely dependent on changes in our working capital, including sales of accounts receivable under our receivables sales programs and the extension of trade credit by our suppliers, investments in manufacturing inventory, facilities and equipment, repayments of obligations under outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of common stock. In 2024, we generated 340 million of cash from operations. Our primary sources of liquidity as of September 28, 2024 consisted of (1) cash and cash equivalents of 626 million; (2) our Credit Agreement, under which 786 million, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, was available; (3) our foreign short-term borrowing facilities of 71 million, all of which was available; (4) proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable under our receivables sales programs; and (5) cash generated from operations. Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders, we may increase the revolver commitments under the Credit Agreement by an additional 200 million. 
 
 We believe our existing cash resources and other sources of liquidity, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, should demand for our services decrease significantly over the next 12 months, should we be unable to recover on inventory obligations owed to us 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 by our customers or should we experience significant increases in delinquent or uncollectible accounts receivable for any reason, our cash provided by operations could decrease significantly and we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity to continue our operations at their current level. 
 
 We invest our cash in numerous financial institutions that we believe to be of high quality. However, there can be no assurance that one or more of such institutions will not become insolvent in the future, in which case all or a portion of our uninsured funds on deposit with such institutions could be lost. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, approximately 34 of our cash balance was held in the United States. Should we choose or need to remit cash to the United States from our foreign locations, we may incur tax obligations which would reduce the amount of cash ultimately available to the United States. We believe that cash held in the United States, together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement and cash from foreign subsidiaries that could be remitted to the United States without tax consequences, will be sufficient to meet our United States liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. SIPL s cash and cash equivalents balance of 200 million as of September 28, 2024 is not available for general corporate purposes and must be retained in SIPL to fund its operations. 

Contractual Obligations 
 
 As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. Our estimated future obligations consist of leases, our Term Loan Due 2027, pension plan funding obligations and unrecognized tax benefits as of September 28, 2024. 
 
 A summary of our operating lease obligations as of September 28, 2024 can be found in Note 7 Leases of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. 
 
 A summary of our long-term debt obligations as of September 28, 2024 can be found in Note 6 Debt of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. 
 
 We have defined benefit pension plans with an underfunded amount of 39 million as of September 28, 2024. We will be required to provide additional funding to these plans in the future if our returns on plan assets are not sufficient to meet our funding obligations. See Note 15 Employee Benefit Plans of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. 
 
 The Company s long-term liabilities arising from unrecognized tax benefits can be found in Note 10 Income Tax of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. 
 
 We also have outstanding firm purchase orders with certain suppliers for the purchase of inventory which are generally short-term in nature. Orders for standard, or catalog, items can typically be canceled with little or no financial penalty. Our policy regarding non-standard or customized items dictates that such items are only ordered specifically for customers who have contractually assumed liability for the inventory, although exceptions are made to this policy in certain situations. Accordingly, our liability from purchase obligations under these purchase orders is not expected to be significant. Lastly, pursuant to arrangements under which vendors consign inventory to us, we may be required to purchase such inventory after a certain period of time. To date, we have not been required to purchase a significant amount of inventory pursuant to these time limitations. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Our primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our Term Loan Due 2027, under which 319 million is currently outstanding, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, for which the interest rate we pay is based on a floating index. As of September 28, 2024, we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 300 million that effectively convert our floating rate Term Loan Due 2027 to a fixed rate term loan. An immediate 10 percent change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations. For more information about our debt and derivative instruments, see Note 5 Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk and Note 6 Debt of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 
 We transact business in foreign currencies. Our foreign exchange policy requires that we take certain steps to limit our foreign exchange exposures resulting from certain assets and liabilities and forecasted cash flows. However, our policy does not require us to hedge all foreign exchange exposures. Furthermore, our foreign currency hedges are based on forecasted transactions and estimated balances, the amount of which may differ from that actually incurred. As a result, we can experience foreign exchange gains and losses in our results of operations. 
 
 We enter into short-term foreign currency forward contracts to hedge currency exposures associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies such as Indian rupee, Mexican peso and Chinese renminbi. These contracts generally have maturities of up to two months and these forward contracts are not designated as part of a hedging relationship for accounting purposes. Accordingly, all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked-to-market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other expense, in the consolidated statements of income. From an economic perspective, the objective of our hedging program is for gains or losses on forward contracts to substantially offset gains and losses on the underlying hedged items. As of September 28, 2024, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts to exchange various foreign currencies for U.S. dollars in an aggregate notional amount of 366 million. 
 
 We also utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from (1) forecasted non-functional currency sales and (2) forecasted non-functional currency materials, labor, overhead and other expenses. These contracts may be up to twelve months in duration and are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the contracts is recorded in stockholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. We had forward contracts related to cash flow hedges in various foreign currencies in an aggregate notional amount of 117 million as of September 28, 2024. 
 
 The net impact of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates would not be material to our consolidated financial statements, provided we accurately forecast and estimate our foreign currency exposure. If such forecasts are materially inaccurate, we could incur significant gains or losses.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Bo ard of Directors and Stockholders of Sanmina Corporation 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sanmina Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO because material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to (i) inappropriate tone at the top in the control environment at one of the Company s divisions, specifically division management did not sufficiently promote, monitor or enforce appropriate accounting policies and procedures, thereby resulting in inappropriate and unsupported adjustments to the quarterly contract cost estimate process; (ii) the Company not maintaining a sufficient complement of finance personnel at the division with an appropriate level of expertise, knowledge and training in internal control over financial reporting commensurate with the Company s financial reporting requirements; (iii) the division not designing and maintaining effective controls over the quarterly contract estimate review process, which led to the failure to timely and appropriately record adjustments to quarterly estimates; and (iv) the Company not designing and maintaining effective controls to properly support and account for the transfer of control to its customers of certain raw materials inventory. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses referred to above are described in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered these material weaknesses in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Revenue Recognition using the Cost-to-cost Method for Government Contracts in the Defense and Aerospace Division 
 
 As described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues for the CPS segment were 1.5 billion for the year ended September 28, 2024, of which the defense and aerospace division represents a portion of the segment. The Company recognizes revenue for defense and aerospace government contracts on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion), which management believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Recognition of revenue on government contracts requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition using the cost-to-cost method for government contracts in the defense and aerospace division is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated costs for such contracts and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence related to management s determination of estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs. Also, as described in the Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting section, material weaknesses were identified related to this matter. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) testing management s process for developing the estimation of costs for a sample of defense and aerospace government contracts; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimate; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s determination of estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management s determination of the estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs used involved (i) assessing management s ability to reasonably estimate costs for government contracts by assessing the nature and status of government contracts; (ii) performing retrospective reviews of government contract estimates and changes in estimates over time; and (iii) obtaining evidence to support estimated costs.

To establish the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company estimates credit risk associated with accounts receivable by considering the creditworthiness of its customers, past experience, specific facts and circumstances, and the overall economic climate in industries that it serves. To establish the allowance for product returns and other adjustments, the Company primarily utilizes historical data.

years. Certain of these leases contain an option to extend the lease term for additional periods or to terminate the lease after an initial non-cancelable term. Renewal options are considered in the measurement of the Company s initial lease liability and corresponding right-of-use ROU asset only if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. Leases with a term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the Company s balance sheet. 
 
 The Company s lease liability and ROU assets represent the present value of future fixed lease payments which are a combination of lease components and non-lease components such as maintenance and utilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of the Company s lease payments are variable because such payments adjust periodically based on changes in consumer price and other indexes. Variable payments are expensed as incurred and not included in the measurement of lease liabilities and ROU assets. Since the Company s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date for purposes of determining the present value of lease payments. The Company s incremental borrowing rate is based on the term of the lease, the economic environment of the lease and the effect of collateralization, if any.

 of the Company s revenue is recognized on an over time basis, which is as products are manufactured or services are performed. Because of this, and the fact that there is no work in process or finished goods inventory associated with contracts for which revenue is recognized on an over-time basis, or more of the Company s inventory at the end of a given period is in the form of raw materials. For contracts for which revenue is required to be recognized at a point in time, the Company recognizes revenue when it has transferred control of the related goods, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer. 
 
 In our Defense and Aerospace division, we apply the cost-to-cost method for government contracts which requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs included in the total estimated costs at completion. Additionally, the Company evaluates whether contract modifications for claims have been approved and, if so, estimates the amount, if any, of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price of the contract. 
 
 Estimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs expected to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation are updated on a quarterly basis. These estimates consider costs incurred to date and estimated costs to be incurred over the

to and/or upon achievement of specified performance criteria. Stock-based compensation expense for time-based and performance-based restricted stock awards is valued at the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. During the requisite service period, performance-based restricted stock awards are monitored by management for probability of achievement of performance goals and if it becomes probable that the number of awarded shares that will vest is greater than or less than the previous estimate of the number of awarded shares that will vest, an adjustment to stock-based compensation expense will be recognized as a change in accounting estimate. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for market-based restricted stock units measured at fair value on the grant date using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The stock-based compensation expense for awards with market conditions will be recognized over the requisite service periods regardless of whether the market conditions are satisfied.

 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 The Company is exposed to certain risks related to its ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is foreign currency exchange risk. 
 
 Forward contracts on various foreign currencies are used to manage foreign currency risk associated with forecasted foreign currency transactions and certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The Company s primary foreign currency cash flows are in India, Mexico and China. 
 
 The Company had the following outstanding foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures: 
 Number of contracts Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges: Notional amount (in thousands) Number of contracts 
 
 The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures generally result from (1) forecasted non-functional currency sales and (2) forecasted non-functional currency materials, labor, overhead and other expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are generally one to two months in duration but, by policy, may be up to in duration. The amount of gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income on derivative instruments and the amount of gain or loss reclassified from AOCI into income were not material for any period presented herein and is included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.

 and are not designated as accounting hedges. Accordingly, these contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each period with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other expense, in the consolidated statements of income. The amount of gains or losses associated with these forward contracts was not material for any period presented herein. From an economic perspective, the objective of the Company s hedging program is for gains and losses on forward contracts to substantially offset gains and losses on the underlying hedged items. In addition to the contracts disclosed in the table above, the Company has numerous contracts that have been closed from an economic and financial accounting perspective and will settle early in the first month of the following quarter. Since these offsetting contracts do not expose the Company to risk of fluctuations in exchange rates, these contracts have been excluded from the above table. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Company enters into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in Secured Overnight Financing Rate benchmark interest rate SOFR associated with anticipated variable rate borrowings. These interest rate swaps have a maturity date of and effectively convert a portion of the Company s variable interest rate obligations to fixed interest rate obligations. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . Interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million and million were outstanding as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The aggregate effective interest rate of these swaps as of September 28, 2024 was approximately . 
 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with recognized financial institutions, both domestic and foreign. Cash and cash equivalents may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits, but may generally be redeemed upon demand. Periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions are performed and the Company attempts to limit its exposure with any one institution. One of the Company s most significant credit risks is the ultimate realization of accounts receivable. This risk is mitigated by ongoing credit evaluations of, and frequent contact with, the Company s customers, especially its most significant customers, thus enabling it to monitor changes in business operations and respond accordingly. The Company generally does not require collateral for sales on credit. The Company considers these concentrations of credit risks when estimating its allowance for doubtful accounts. Foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps are maintained with high quality counterparties to reduce the Company s credit risk and are recorded on the Company s balance sheets at fair value.

 On (the Closing Date ), the Company entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement that provides for a million revolving credit facility and a million secured term loan Term Loan Due 2027 ). Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders, the Company may increase the revolving commitment up to an additional million. Costs incurred in connection with Credit Agreement of million are classified as long-term debt and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Term Loan Due 2027 using the effective interest method.

Upon repayment, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million consisting of a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs under such prior agreement. 
 
 Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company s option, at either the SOFR or a base rate, in each case plus a spread determined based on the Company s credit rating. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to base rate loans and at the end of an interest period (and at three month intervals if the interest period exceeds three months) in the case of SOFR loans. The outstanding principal amount of all loans under the Credit Agreement, including the Term Loan Due 2027, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is due on . The Company is required to repay a portion of the principal amount of the Term Loan Due 2027 equal to of the principal in quarterly installments.

 Environmental Matters 
 
 The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and administrative orders concerning environmental protection, including those addressing the discharge of pollutants into the environment, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the materials used in products, and the recycling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. 
 
 In June 2008, the Company was named by the Orange County Water District in a suit alleging that a predecessor company s actions at a plant the Company sold in 1998 contributed to polluted groundwater managed by the plaintiff. The complaint seeks recovery of compensatory and other damages, as well as declaratory relief, for the payment of costs necessary to investigate, monitor, remediate, abate and contain contamination of groundwater. In April 2013, all claims against the Company were dismissed. The plaintiff appealed this dismissal and the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment in August 2017, remanding the case back to the Superior Court of California for trial. The trial against the Company and several other defendants commenced in April 2021 and the submission of evidence concluded in May 2022. On April 3, 2023, the court published a statement of decision finding the Company and other remaining defendants liable for certain past investigation costs incurred by the plaintiff. Subsequent proceedings to assess the Company s and other defendants liability for the plaintiff s future remediation and other costs, including attorneys fees, were expected. However, without admitting any liability, in August 2024, the Company and plaintiff agreed to settle this matter and all pending litigation in exchange for the Company s payment to the plaintiff of million.

The Company will continue to prosecute vigorously its claims against Dialight and, ultimately, to defend on appeal and enforce any resulting judgment. 
 
 In May 2023, Sanmina Corporation and its SCI Technology, Inc. subsidiary SCI received Civil Investigative Demands CIDs from the United States Department of Justice DOJ pursuant to the civil False Claims Act FCA ). The stated purpose of the CIDs a form of subpoena requiring responses to written interrogatories and the production of documents relating to certain contracts, projects, proposals and business activities of SCI going back to 2010 is to determine whether there is or has been a violation of the FCA with respect to the provision of products and services to the government. These CIDs supplement several CIDs relating to the same subject matter served upon SCI and certain current and former SCI and Sanmina Corporation employees beginning in August 2020, pursuant to which SCI produced documents and information and certain of the current and former employees provided oral testimony. Sanmina and SCI cooperated with the DOJ investigation. On May 13, 2024, the Company learned that United States of America ex rel. Carl R. Eckert v. SCI Technology, Inc. et al. (the Eckert Qui Tam Suit had been filed under seal in June 2020, and is now unsealed. On May 13, 2024, the Company also learned that the DOJ had filed a notice in the Eckert Qui Tam Suit stating that, while its investigation would continue, it was declining to intervene at the current time. The Eckert Qui Tam Suit, filed by a former SCI employee, alleges on behalf of the United States, 16 FCA counts that relate substantially to the same contracts and issues that the DOJ has investigated over the past four years, including making false certifications under the Truth in Negotiations Act and Cost Accounting Standards, submitting false cost and pricing data, fraudulently inducing the government to award contracts and violations of the Service Contract Act. The complaint alleges such claimed violations defrauded the government in an amount approximating million. The complaint seeks, on behalf of the government, treble damages, civil penalties and interest payable thereon. On October 7, 2024, Sanmina and SCI filed a motion to dismiss the Eckert Qui Tam Suit. A decision on the motion is expected in the first half of calendar 2025. Sanmina Corporation and SCI intend to defend vigorously against the claims made in the Eckert Qui Tam Suit. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the Eckert Qui Tam Suit, although a loss is currently not considered to be probable or estimable. 
 
 On November 14, 2023, employee Gerardo Ramirez, filed two lawsuits against the Company in the Alameda County Superior Court (together, the Ramirez Cases ). The first, a putative class action, alleges violations of various California Labor Code and Wage Order requirements, including provisions governing overtime, meal and rest periods, minimum wage requirements, payment of wages during employment, wage statements, payroll records, and reimbursement of business expenses. The class action complaint seeks certification of a class of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company within the State of California at any time between March 1, 2021 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys fees, pre-judgment interest, and costs of suit. The second action, a complaint under California s Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 PAGA ), alleges substantially similar violations and a violation of the provision governing payment of final wages and seeks penalties individually and on behalf of the State of California and other aggrieved employees, along with attorneys fees and costs. On May 16, 2024 and June 14, 2024, former employee Carlos Lobatos filed class and PAGA actions in the Santa Clara County Superior Court (the Lobatos Cases alleging violations substantially similar to the violations in the Ramirez Cases, and, in the case of the Lobatos PAGA action, additional violations related to sick leave, suitable rest facilities, seating, failure to retain and provide employment and payroll records, reporting time pay, day of rest rules, payroll deductions, paid time off, and various unlawful employment practices. The Lobatos class action complaint seeks certification of a class of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company (directly or via a staffing agency) within the State of California at any time between May 16, 2020 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys fees, pre-judgment interest, and costs of suit. On August 12, 2024, former employee Mando Gomez filed a class and PAGA action in the Alameda County Superior Court (the Gomez Case alleging violations substantially similar to the violations in the Ramirez Cases. The Gomez Case seeks certification of a class of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company (directly or via a staffing agency) within the State of California at any time between August 12, 2020 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution,

 The Company's provision for income taxes for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was million of income before taxes), million of income before taxes) and million of income before taxes), respectively. 
 
 The effective tax rate for 2024 was higher than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at rates higher than the U.S. statutory rate, state taxes, and unfavorable permanent differences. The effective tax rates for 2023 and 2022 were lower than the expected U.S. statutory rate of primarily due to a million and million tax benefit, respectively, resulting from the release of certain foreign tax reserves due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations.

 The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

 A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information and other factors, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company regularly assesses its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial results. Significant judgment is required in assessing the Company s ability to generate revenue, gross profit, operating income and jurisdictional taxable income in future periods. The Company s valuation allowance as of September 28, 2024 relates primarily to foreign net operating losses, except for million related to U.S. state net operating losses. 
 
 The Company provides deferred tax liabilities for the tax consequences associated with the undistributed earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the subsidiaries' parent unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. As of September 28, 2024, income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for approximately million of cumulative undistributed earnings of several non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of the U.S. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

 million and million, respectively, and for federal tax. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring in fiscal year 2025 and expire at various dates through . Certain foreign net operating losses will begin expiring in 2025. However, the majority of foreign net operating losses carryforward indefinitely. As of September 28, 2024, the Company has federal tax credits of million that expire between 2031 and 2044. There are certain restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. The utilization of certain net operating losses may be restricted due to changes in ownership and business operations. 
 
 Following is a reconciliation of the statutory federal tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate: 
 Effect of foreign operations Permanent items Federal credits ) ) ) Other ) State income taxes, net of federal benefit Release of foreign tax reserves ) ) ) Effective tax rate 
 
 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued penalties and interest, is as follows: 
 Increase (decrease) related to prior year tax positions ) ) Increase related to current year tax positions Settlements ) ) Decrease related to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations ) ) ) Balance, end of year 
 
 The Company had reserves of million as of each of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 for the payment of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. During 2024, the Company recognized an income tax benefit for interest and penalties of million due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations compared to an income tax benefit of million in 2023. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Should the Company be able to ultimately recognize all of these uncertain tax positions, it would result in a benefit to net income of million in 2024. 
 
 The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. 
 
 As a result of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service IRS for fiscal 2008 through 2010, the Company received a Revenue Agent s Report RAR on November 17, 2023 asserting an underpayment of tax of approximately million for fiscal 2009. The asserted underpayment results from the IRS s proposed disallowance of a million worthless stock deduction in fiscal 2009. Such disallowance, if upheld, would reduce the Company s available net operating loss carryforwards and result in additional tax and interest attributable to fiscal 2021 and later years, which could be material. The Company disagrees with the IRS s position as asserted in the RAR and is vigorously contesting this matter through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. The Company does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with any certainty the timing of such resolution. Although the final resolution of this matter remains

 million related to payments, the resolution of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations. In addition, there could be a corresponding decrease in accrued interest and penalties of approximately million. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD ), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 . Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax and where enacted, the rules begin to be effective for the Company in fiscal 2025. The Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of the future minimum tax. The adoption and effective dates of these rules may vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect the Company s provision for income taxes. The Company does not expect any material impact from these tax law changes in fiscal 2025.

 Stock Repurchase Program 
 
 During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased million shares, million shares and million shares of its common stock for million, million and million (including commissions), respectively, under stock repurchase programs authorized by the Company s Board of Directors. These programs have no expiration dates and the timing of repurchases will depend upon capital needs to support the growth of the Company s business, market conditions and other factors. Although stock repurchases are intended to increase stockholder value, they also reduce the Company s liquidity. As of September 28, 2024, an aggregate of million remains available under these programs. 
 
 In addition to the repurchases discussed above, the Company withheld million, million and million shares of its common stock during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. The Company paid million, million and million, respectively, to applicable tax authorities in connection with these repurchases.

 Defined benefit plans covering certain employees in the United States and Canada were frozen in 2001. During 2022, the Board of Directors approved the termination of the Company's frozen U.S. defined benefit plan, effective July 3, 2022. In connection with this termination, the Company purchased a group annuity contract for million during 2022 that provides for the administration of future payments to eligible plan participants.

The Company determined the voting interest model was applicable under ASC 810 and concluded that, despite not having a majority ownership interest, the Company has a controlling financial interest in SIPL through the management services contract. Therefore, the Company has, by contract, the unilateral ability to control the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL s business. Because the Company has a controlling financial interest in SIPL, it consolidates SIPL.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 
 None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that their objectives are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of disclosure controls and procedures must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all disclosure control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024. Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 28, 2024 because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below. 
 
 (b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the material weaknesses described herein existed as of September 28, 2024. As a result, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 28, 2024 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis. 
 
 We identified the following material weaknesses as of September 28, 2024: 
 
 As previously reported, we identified material weaknesses in the control environment at one of our divisions due to this division maintaining an inappropriate tone at the top. Specifically, division management did not sufficiently promote, monitor or enforce appropriate accounting policies and procedures, thereby resulting in inappropriate and unsupported adjustments to the quarterly contract cost estimate process. Additionally, we did not maintain a sufficient complement of finance personnel at the division with an appropriate level of expertise, knowledge and training in internal control over financial reporting commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. These material weaknesses contributed to an additional material weakness that the division did not design and maintain effective controls over the quarterly contract estimate review process, which lead to the failure to timely and appropriately record adjustments to quarterly estimates. 
 
 These material weaknesses resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended October 3, 2020, October 2, 2021 and October 1, 2022 and for the quarterly fiscal periods included in such fiscal years and for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022. These material weaknesses also resulted in immaterial misstatements of our consolidated financial statements for the quarterly fiscal periods as of and for the periods ended April 1, 2023, July 1, 2023, September 30, 2023, June 29, 2024 and September 28, 2024. Additionally, each of these material weaknesses could result in misstatements of the accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 
 In connection with our financial reporting process for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2024, we identified an additional material weakness as the Company did not design and maintain effective controls to properly support and account for the transfer of control to its customers of certain raw materials inventory. This material weakness resulted in adjustments and immaterial misstatements to inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 
 75 

Table of Contents 

 2023, respectively. Additionally, this material weakness could result in misstatements of the aforementioned accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Item 8. 
 
 (c) Status of Remediation of Material Weaknesses 
 
 Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weaknesses 
 
 Management plans to remediate the material weaknesses described above primarily by ensuring that relevant program management and finance personnel possess sufficient knowledge and experience and are sufficiently engaged to identify, escalate and drive closure of matters that could impact estimated long-term customer program costs and/or require the recording of additional expenses in the Company s financial statements. 
 
 To date, management undertook the following remedial actions in conjunction with the above plan: 
 
 Removed internal control over financial reporting responsibilities and representation from designated individuals and added new individuals for these responsibilities and representations. 
 Conducted training sessions for all employees involved in the estimate at completion EAC process on ethics, reporting and fraud, as well as the importance of EACs to financial reporting. 
 Implemented a certification process whereby a select group of employees with key roles in the EAC and financial reporting processes are required to make certain representations about the completeness and accuracy of EACs, as well as a representation that they are not aware of any improprieties in the accounting or control functions. 
 Realigned reporting lines whereby program financial analysts report directly to the finance organization. 
 Hired a President to lead the division and added several new employees to the finance department of the division. 
 Engaged third-party consultants with extensive Aerospace and Defense experience and expertise to perform a comprehensive review of the division s accounting and reporting functions, including performing an evaluation of the division s policies and procedures. 
 
 These actions represent significant progress in addressing the material weaknesses. We plan to fully implement and operate the redesigned processes and procedures in the upcoming fiscal year and to begin testing the enhanced controls starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The material weaknesses will not be considered formally remediated until these controls have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Remediation Plan for the Material Weakness Identified in Fiscal 2024 
 
 Management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, intends to remediate the material weakness described above primarily by (i) updating the relevant accounting policy and procedures to be more prescriptive, (ii) enhancing the review processes applicable to evaluating whether the transfer of control of inventories has occurred or whether payments received from customers should be reported as a liability, (iii) establishing controls over the preparation and review of customer level inventory reconciliations, and (iv) training of sales, operations and finance personnel responsible for administering and accounting for customer-purchased inventory arrangements. 
 
 (d) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 The Company has determined that all executive officers and Directors of the Company and certain other persons identified by the Company from time to time who meet the requirements set forth in Exhibit II and who have been notified that they have been so identified must refrain from trading in the Company s Securities, even during Trading Windows, without first complying with the Company s pre-clearance process. Each such person should contact the General Counsel at least 24 hours prior to commencing any trade in the Company s Securities. The General Counsel will consult as necessary with senior management of and or counsel to the Company before clearing any proposed trade. The General Counsel shall make a decision promptly, generally within 24 hours, whether to approve a transaction. Although an Insider who has adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan need not seek pre-clearance from the General Counsel before each trade under the plan takes place, all Insiders must obtain Company approval prior to adopting a proposed Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. See Requirements of Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans, below. 
 INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY 
 Every officer, director and other employee, consultant and contractor has the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy against insider trading. An Insider may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in the Company s Securities even if he or she planned to make the transaction before learning of the Material Non-public Information and even though the Insider believes he or she may suffer an economic loss or forego anticipated profit by waiting. 
 DUTIES OF GENERAL COUNSEL 
 The General Counsel is responsible for administering this Policy and shall have the following duties

The withholding of restricted stock units by the Company to pay taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. 
 Bona fide gifts of Company securities. 
 Transactions effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by an Insider listed on Exhibit I or II meeting the requirements set forth below under Requirements of Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans. 
 REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 10B5-1 TRADING PLANS 
 Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides a defense against claims that an Insider traded while in possession of Material Non-public Information as long as such trade was made pursuant to a plan adopted before the time the Insider became aware of such information (a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan ). Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans do not provide an absolute defense from all claims of insider trading. In addition, any trades by Directors and executive officers pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan must be reported on Form 4 s and remain subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, which generally prohibits purchases and sales of Company Securities within a six month period. See Additional Information Directors and Officers, below. 
 The Company permits Insiders who are subject to restrictions on trading during Black-out Periods or subject to the pre-clearance requirements contained herein to enter into Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans must be in writing and must be specific as to the number of or dollar amount of Company Securities to be sold during the term of the plan or the way such number will be determined. For example, a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan can specify a limit price above which shares will be sold. All Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans must be approved in advance by the General Counsel. 
 The safest time to adopt a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is immediately after the Trading Window opens each quarter or immediately following the Company s filing of its quarterly or annual financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That is because, generally speaking, all material information concerning the Company would be publicly available at such times. Insiders may not adopt a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan during a Black-out Period. 
 Trades under a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan made shortly after such plan is adopted are sometimes challenged as having been made while in possession of material non-public information. For that reason, and in order to ensure compliance with recently adopted SEC rules, the Company requires that the first trade taking place under a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan occur no earlier than the later of (a) 91 days after the date the plan is adopted and (b) the third business day after disclosure of financial results for the fiscal quarter in which the plan is adopted on either a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K filed with the SEC (but in no case later than 120 days after the date the plant was adopted). Because short-term plans generally provide less protection than longer-term plans, the Company recommends that Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans have a term of at least one year. 
 Furthermore, Insiders may not adopt overlapping Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans, in which trades may be made under one plan before the trades are completed under the previously adopted plan. Insiders who adopt a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan to provide only for a single trade may adopt only one such plan in a rolling 12-month period. These restrictions are intended to comply with recently adopted SEC rules. 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans may be terminated by the Insider, but any trades made subsequent to such termination will not have the benefit of the plan s protection and any such termination could affect the protection afforded to prior sales made pursuant to the plan as well.

 Last Updated March 1, 2023 
 Approval 

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans may be amended, for example to reduce or increase the number of shares subject to the plan. However, any such amendment is considered to be the adoption of a new plan and, as such, no trades may take place under an amended plan earlier than the later of (a) 91 days after the date of the amendment and (b) the third business day after disclosure of financial results for the fiscal quarter in which the plan was amended on either a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K filed with the SEC (but in no case later than 120 days after the date the plant was amended), unless the amendment is administrative in nature. 
 
 Insiders wishing to adopt a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan with respect to employee stock plan securities must use the form provided by the Company s employee stock plan broker, E Trade Securities LLC. This form is available from the Company s Stock Administrator or General Counsel Please note that in addition to the requirements described above, E Trade may require additional terms. E Trade also charges a commission for trades made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. Such additional commissions are borne by the Insider and not the Company. 
 HEDGING AND PLEDGING OF COMPANY SECURITIES 
 The Company believes that hedging, a term used to describe certain practices taken to reduce the economic risk of Company stock ownership (e.g., to prevent losses if the Company s stock price were to fall) is inappropriate when undertaken by employees, officers or directors as such techniques reduce alignment with the interests of our public stockholders. Similarly, the Company believes that pledging of Company stock by employees, officers or directors (i.e., using Company stock as collateral for a loan, such as in a margin account) can be inappropriate when such practice could cause shares to be sold when the trading window is closed or the individual is in possession of material non-public information and would otherwise be prohibited from selling under this policy. Therefore, the Company prohibits employees, officers and directors from (i) purchasing any financial instrument or engaging in any transaction intended to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company s common stock or (ii) engaging in short sales related to the Company s common stock. In addition, the Company prohibits officers and directors from (i) depositing any Company common stock in a margin account or (ii) pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan. The restrictions on pledging hereunder may be waived by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board in its sole discretion. 
 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 
 Directors and certain officers of the Company must comply with the reporting obligations and limitations on short-swing transactions set forth in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The practical effect of these provisions is that officers, Directors and such other persons who purchase and sell the Company s Securities within a six-month period must disgorge all profits to the Company whether or not they had knowledge of any Material Non-public Information. Under these provisions, and so long as certain other criteria are met, neither the grant of an equity award under the Company s equity incentive plans nor the vesting of that award is deemed a purchase under Section 16 however, the sale of any vested shares is considered a sale under Section 16. The Company has provided, or will provide, separate memoranda and other appropriate materials to its executive officers and directors and those identified employees regarding compliance with Section 16 and its related rules. 
 INQUIRIES 
 All questions regarding this Policy, requests for pre-clearance of trades (in the case of Insiders included on the Pre-clearance List) and requests for approval of proposed Rule 10b5-1 plans shall be made to the company s General Counsel (see Company website).
