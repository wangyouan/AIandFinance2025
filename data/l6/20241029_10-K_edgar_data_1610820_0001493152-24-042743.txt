BUSINESS 

Overview
of the Company 

BriaCell
Therapeutics Corp. Briacell or the Company is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that is developing
novel immunotherapies to transform cancer care. Immunotherapies have come to the forefront in the fight against cancer as they harness
the body s own immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. The Company is currently advancing its Bria-IMT targeted
immunotherapy in combination with an immune check point inhibitor (Retifanlimab) in a pivotal 1 Phase 3 study in metastatic
breast cancer. Bria-IMT is currently under Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA intended to accelerate the review process of novel treatments that address unmet medical needs. Positive completion of the pivotal study,
following review by FDA, could lead to full approval of the Bria-IMT immune checkpoint inhibitor combination in metastatic breast
cancer. BriaCell reported benchmark-beating patient survival and clinical benefit in metastatic breast cancer with median overall survival
of 13.4 months in BriaCell s metastatic breast cancer patients vs. 6.7-9.8 months 2 for similar patients reported in
the literature in its Phase 2 study of Bria-IMT combination study with retifanlimab at the 2023 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.
Additionally, BriaCell reported median overall survival of 15.6 months in Phase 2 Bria-IMT study patients treated in
combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients treated with the Phase 3 formulation since 2022 (post-COVID). A completed
Bria-IMT Phase 1 combination study with retifanlimab (an anti-PD1 antibody manufactured by Incyte) confirmed tolerability and
early-stage efficacy. BriaCell is also developing personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapies, Bria-OTS and Bria-OTS+ , which
provides a platform technology to develop personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapies for numerous types of cancer. In September 2024,
the Company announced BriaCell has received positive feedback from its Pre-Investigational New Drug Application (Pre-IND) meeting
with FDA for Bria-PROS+ for prostate cancer. 

Market 

It
is estimated by the National Cancer Institute Cancer Facts and Figures that in 2024, approximately 310,720 women will be diagnosed with
breast cancer in the United States. That means that every two minutes an American woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and more than
42,250 are projected to die in 2024. Although about 100 times less common than in women, breast cancer also affects men. It is estimated
that the lifetime risk of men getting breast cancer is about 1 in 1,000, and the American Cancer Society estimates that approximately
2,790 new cases of invasive male breast cancer will be diagnosed and approximately 530 men will die from breast cancer in 2024. 

According
to the May 2023 Global Oncology Trends 2023 report by the IQVIA Institute, the global market for cancer drugs (including
immunotherapy drugs) is expected to reach nearly 375 billion by the end of 2027, growing at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 17 between 2023 and 2027, of which about 20 is expected to be immuno-oncology drugs.

 Pivotal is an industry term referring to a Phase 3 clinical study intended to show and confirm the safety and efficacy
of a treatment.

About
13 percent of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point during their lifetime. In 2024, over 4 million women were living
with female breast cancer in the United States. Approximately 83 of cases present as invasive breast cancer. Approximately 6 of new
breast cancer diagnoses are Stage IV (metastatic breast cancer MBC ), which has already spread to other organs). Twenty
to thirty percent of all women diagnosed with breast cancer will develop MBC. Breast cancer can be subdivided based on receptor status
- the hormone receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR), collectively referred to as hormone receptors (HR), and the Her2/neu
growth factor receptor (HER2). Based on the latest SEER statistics, 68 were found to be HR+/HER2 , 10 were triple-negative (HR /HER2 ),
10 were HR+/HER2+, and 4 were HR /HER2+. 1 

It
is estimated that over 150,000 women in the US were living with MBC in 2015 2 and this is projected to increase to over 240,000
by 2030. For those with metastatic disease at diagnosis, their 5-year survival rate is 30 . 1 For patients who develop MBC
after initially having localized disease, if they had a good response to treatment (i.e. a disease-free interval of more than 24 months),
their survival rate is similar to that of patients with MBC at initial diagnosis, but if their disease-free interval is less than 24
months, their prognosis is worse. 4 We currently propose that Bria-IMT s indication will be for the treatment
of patients with MBC who have no approved alternative therapies available. Similarly, another study showed that the median overall survival
among patients with de novo stage IV MBC was 39.2 months, while for patients with relapsed disease it was 27.2 months. 5 Median
progression free survival after first-line therapy is only 9 months and the survival benefit decreases with subsequent lines of therapy. 6
 One study showed that of 386 patients with MBC, 374 (97 received first-line therapy, 254 (66 received second-line therapy,
175 (45 received third-line therapy, and 105 (27 received therapy beyond third-line. 7 More recent data indicates that
for patients with MBC who have received 2 or more prior lines of therapy, median survival is 5.9-9.8 months.

Competition 

Currently
available therapeutic options for breast cancer offer some hope for patients, but there is much room for improvement. Comparable studies
looking primarily at second line or later treatment are shown in Table A , below. Evaluating response rates (partial and
complete responses = ORR), progression free survival PFS and overall survival OS from clinical trials
in similar subjects with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer indicate that response rates range from 2.7 up to 59 , depending on the
population studied and the intervention (median 24 ). PFS ranges from 8 weeks to 12 months (median 5 months) and OS from 6 months to
31 months (median 13 months). 

Table
A: Studies evaluating second-line or later treatment options. Data depict an unpredictable response rate to treatment ranging from
6.9-59 , therefore establishing and confirming the opportunity for Bria-IMT .

MBC
treated with second or higher lines of therapy has a very poor prognosis and few effective therapies that consistently induce long-term
remission, 15 which indicates the market demand and clinical need for new and improved therapeutic drugs and treatment options
in order to improve these response outcomes and patient survival rates. Thus, Bria-IMT has the potential to induce long-term remission,
especially in combination with immunotherapies. Current treatment of MBC is outlined in Figure B , below, which illustrates
different therapeutic treatment options and drugs used upon diagnoses from biopsy and identification of breast cancer biomarkers. 16

Figure
B: Current treatment paradigm for metastatic breast cancer including between different treatment strategies and combination therapies
dependent upon biomarker identification and activity within the breast cancer signaling pathway. 

Of
patients treated with trastuzumab for MBC, one study showed that 241/331 (72 progressed within 27 months (32 per year) with median
survival of 13-14 months (CI 10-15 months). 1 This indicates the high unmet need in this patient population which should facilitate
regulatory review of novel therapies such as Bria-IMT . 

There are a number of cancer vaccines
in development for breast cancer, including but not limited to TPIV200 (Marker Therapeutics, Inc.), AE-37 (Antigen Express), and Stimuvax
(Merck KgA). While these development candidates are aimed at a number of different targets, and AE-37 has published data in the HER2 breast
cancer patient population, there is no guarantee that any of these compounds will not in the future be indicated for treatment of low-to-intermediate
HER2 breast cancer patients and become directly competitive with Bria-IMT. 

While
there are many biotech companies working to create an effective breast cancer vaccine, a significant gap remains in the effectiveness
and safety of second or higher lines of therapy. The most studied targeted immunotherapy, Neuvax (Galena), a HER2 peptide vaccine, failed
a Phase III trial, but there is encouraging data to support at least three ongoing clinical trials combining trastuzumab with HER2 epitope
immunogens. 2 The National Cancer Institute NCI randomized trial adding PANVAC (a poxviral-based immunogen)
to docetaxel increased the median PFS from 3.9 months to 7.9 months and is to be used as a basis for larger, more sophisticated clinical
trials. 3 An immunogen targeting a carbohydrate antigen, globo-H, was associated with improved PFS, but only in the subset
able to mount antibody responses. 4 A Johns Hopkins breast cancer trial using a breast cancer cell line transfected with the
gene for GM-CSF has not been positive but, using the same cell line with trastuzumab, 40 of patients enjoyed clinical benefit (CR+PR+stable)
at one year. 5 Finally, the study of targeted cancer immunotherapies in combination with other therapies is receiving much
attention, particularly combination with checkpoint inhibitors. 6

There
are several other approaches to developing targeted breast cancer immunotherapies. These include using peptide cocktails, a triple peptide
regimen, recombinant HER2, antigen-pulsed dendritic cells, DNA immunogens, whole cell allogeneic GM-CSF secreting SKBR3 or T47D cells,
an (HLA)-A2/A3-restricted immunogenic peptide derived from the HER2 protein, oxidized mannan-MUC1, and personalized peptide immunogens. 

Among
the most promising results in patients with advanced disease have been using whole-cell preparations, particularly if the cells are engineered
to express GM-CSF. We are taking this approach and capitalizing on positive initial results with Bria-IMT monotherapy in difficult
to treat patients using a regimen that both limits regulatory T cell activity (using low dose cyclophosphamide pre-treatment) and boosts
the immune response (using post-dose alpha interferon in the inoculation sites). The combination with PD-1 inhibitors is a logical extension
of our findings where 21 of 23 MBC patients had demonstrable PD-L1 expression on the circulating tumor cells CTCs and/or
circulating cancer-associated macrophage-like cells CAMLs ). The overall strategy, once the initial milestones have been
met, to enroll additional patients for product registration, will allow rapid progression of the best therapeutic option to a Biologics
License Application BLA ). 

Cancer
immunotherapy has become a significant growth area for the biopharmaceutical industry, attracting large pharmaceutical companies as well
as small niche players. Generally, our principal competitors in the cancer immunotherapy market comprise both companies with currently
approved products for various indications, such as manufacturers of approved bispecific antibodies, CAR-T cells, and checkpoint inhibitors,
as well as companies currently engaged in cancer immunotherapy clinical development. The large and medium-size players who have successfully
obtained approval for cancer immunotherapy products include Bristol-Myers Squib Company, Merck Co., Inc., Genentech, Inc. (a subsidiary
of Roche Holding AG), AstraZeneca PLC, Celgene Corporation, Johnson Johnson/Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Amgen, Novartis, Acerta Pharmaceuticals
(a subsidiary of AstraZeneca), Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Celgene), Kite Pharma, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead
Sciences, Inc. and Pfizer, Inc./EMD Serono, Inc. Most of these companies, either alone or together with their collaborative partners,
have substantially greater financial resources than does BriaCell. 

Companies
developing novel products with similar indications to those we are pursuing are expected to influence our ability to penetrate and maintain
market share. For patients with early stage breast cancer, adjuvant therapy is often given to prevent recurrence and increase the chance
of long-term disease-free survival. Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer can include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy,
or combinations thereof. In addition, the HER2 targeted drug trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN), alone or in combination with pertuzumab (PERJETA),
both manufactured and marketed by Roche/Genentech, may be given to patients with tumors with high expression of HER2 (IHC 3+), as well
as other novel targets such as MUC1, which may be useful in treating breast cancer. In addition, the FDA approved the first ever immunotherapy
regimen for breast cancer to the Roche/Genentech PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ), combined with Celgene s nab-paclitaxel
(ABRAXANE) for TNBC that cannot be removed with surgery and is locally advanced or metastatic. 

Many
of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources
than we do, and also have greater experience in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those
treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for cancer immunotherapy products and achieving
widespread market acceptance. Our competitors treatments may be more effectively marketed and sold than any products we may commercialize,
thus causing limited market share before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing of our cancer immunotherapy product
candidate. 

Mergers
and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller
number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative
arrangements with large and established companies. These activities may lead to consolidated efforts that allow for more rapid development
of cancer immunotherapy product candidates. 

These
competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, the ability to work with
specific clinical contract organizations due to conflicts of interest, and the conduct of trials in the ability to recruit clinical trial
sites and subjects for our clinical trials. 

We
expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, price and the
availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated
if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are viewed as safer, more convenient or less expensive than any products that
we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval
for our current product candidates or any other future product candidate, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong
market position before we are able to enter the market.

Bria-IMT 

About Bria-IMT 

Bria-IMT ,
BriaCell s lead candidate, is a whole-cell immunotherapy. Bria-IMT in combination with an immune check point inhibitor is
undergoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical testing in patients with advanced MBC patients who have failed prior lines of therapy. The pivotal
Phase 3 combination study is listed on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06072612. 

Developed
and characterized by a team of dedicated scientists and clinicians, Bria-IMT (SV-BR-1-GM) is a targeted immunotherapy being developed
for the treatment of breast cancer. Bria-IMT is a genetically engineered human breast cancer cell line with features of immune
cells and clinically applied as a targeted immunotherapy. 

In
short, Bria-IMT immunotherapy is a genetically engineered human breast cancer cell line derived from a grade II tumor which activates
the immune system to attack and destroy breast cancer tumors. 

Mechanism
of Action of Bria-IMT 

The
mechanism of action of Bria-IMT is currently under investigation. It is likely that the expression of certain breast cancer antigens
(proteins expressed in breast cancer cells) in Bria-IMT generates strong T cell and potentially antibody responses - resulting
in recognition and destruction of cancerous cells. 37 

Bria-IMT 
is designed to secrete GM-CSF, a factor that stimulates components of the immune system. Specifically, GM-CSF activates dendritic cells,
the cells that start immune responses. These activated dendritic cells then activate T cells, a key component of the immune system, to
recognize the tumor cells as foreign, and eliminate them. To amplify this action, we have combined Bria-IMT with other immune
system activators including cyclophosphamide (used in low doses to reduce immune suppression), and interferon- , a cytokine that
further activates the immune system. We believe this approach of simultaneous activation of the immune system via different pathways
will improve the immune system response to attack and destroy cancer cells. 

Pivotal
Phase 3 Clinical Study of Bria-IMT in Combination with an Immune Check Point Inhibitor in Metastatic Breast Cancer 

Bria-IMT 
is currently under Fast Track Designation by the FDA intended to accelerate the
review process of novel treatments that address unmet medical needs. Positive completion of the pivotal study, following review by the
FDA, could lead to full approval of the Bria-IMT immune checkpoint inhibitor combination in advanced metastatic breast cancer. 

The
FDA has agreed that improvement in overall survival in the Bria-IMT combination arm as compared to the physician s choice
of treatment arm will be the primary endpoint of the study. The study is expected to enroll 177 patients in the Bria-IMT combination
therapy arm and 177 patients in the treatment of physician s choice arm. To gather additional information on the Bria-IMT 
regimen alone, 50 patients are expected to be enrolled in this regimen and will be eligible for combination therapy following their initial
post treatment evaluation. The study will have an interim evaluation for efficacy which could result in early completion of the study.
We expect frequent and responsive FDA communication under our Fast Track status during our pivotal Phase 3 study. 

The
successful completion of the pivotal study would allow BriaCell to subsequently submit a Biologics License Application and accelerate
the path to commercialization. 

BriaCell s
partnership with New York Cancer Blood Specialists NYCBS as clinical site with more than 30 locations and 35 hospital
affiliations throughout Nassau and Suffolk counties, in the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, and Brooklyn to conduct its pivotal

Phase
1/2 Clinical Trial of Bria-IMT in Combination with Immune Check Point Inhibitors in Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer 

BriaCell
has been conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of Bria-IMT , in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab
(KEYTRUDA manufactured by Merck Co., Inc.) and retifanlimab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor manufactured by Incyte. The
combination study is listed in ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03328026 under FDA-approved BB-IND 10312 under protocol BRI-ROL-001 at ten clinical
sites throughout the United States. 

BriaCell
announced benchmark-beating patient survival and clinical benefit in advanced metastatic breast cancer with median overall survival of
13.5 months in BriaCell s advanced metastatic breast cancer patients vs. 6.7-9.8 months 1 for similar patients reported
in the literature. 

The
ongoing study of BRI-ROL-001 combination therapy studies of the Bria-IMT regimen with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI). In
the ongoing study of BRI-ROL-001, in phase I the Bria-IMT regimen was dosed in combination with Keytruda in 11 patients
and in 12 patients with retifanlimab, with one patient starting on the combination with
Keytruda and crossing-over to the combination with retifanlimab (22 patients total). In phase II of the study, the
Bria-IMT regimen is being dosed in combination with retifanlimab with patients randomized to either receive the
Bria-IMT regimen first (16 patients) or retifanlimab first (16 patients). For the 11 patients treated in combination with
Keytruda in phase I, the disease control data is shown below: 

11

For
the 12 patients treated in combination with retifanlimab in phase I, the disease control data is shown below: 

12
 patients were treated with Bria-IMT plus retifanlimab 

All
 patients were very heavily pre-treated with a median of 5 prior systemic therapy regimens (i.e. chemotherapy), further underscoring
 BriaCell s positive patient outcomes 

Tolerability

Efficacy:
 70 (7/10) of evaluable patients showed disease control (5/10 evaluable patients including 1 PR and 4 SD) and/or progression-free
 survival (PFS) benefits compared with their last therapy regimen. 

The
overall survival of the patients for all patients on this study has been evaluated in an ongoing fashion. Since the study was largely
on hold during COVID (2020 and 2021), patients dosed in 2019 and 2020 have been followed for a longer time. Therefore survival data has
been evaluated for patients dosed before 2022 and since 2022. This should be considered in the context of clinical studies in patients
with advanced breast cancer who have failed at least 2 prior regimens. Several recent publications are noted here:

Development
of Additional Immunotherapy Cell Lines 

Based on these
 observations, BriaCell is extending this technology to other types of cancer by developing additional immunotherapy cell lines. 

Cell lines
 currently being genetically engineered include a breast cancer cell line, a prostate cancer cell line, a non-small cell lung cancer
 cell line and a melanoma cell line. 

The
 genetic engineering has been completed for the breast cancer cell line and GMP manufacturing completed. BriaCell
 is currently evaluating its personalized immunotherapy, Bria-BRES , as monotherapy and in combination with
 PD-1 inhibitor tislelizumab, in a phase 1/2a study in metastatic breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06471673 ).
 The Phase 1/2 study is a bucket trial with initial study in breast cancer with extensions to prostate cancer, lung
 cancer and melanoma. . 

On May 28, 2024, BriaCell announced
 a clinical supply agreement with BeiGene for Bria-OTS First in Human Study. Study is to evaluate the effects of Bria-OTS 
 in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab, in advanced, late stage, heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer. 

In September
 2024, BriaCell announced positive pre-IND meeting with FDA for Bria-PROS+ for prostate cancer 

Enhanced
 version (Bria-OTS+ is scheduled to enter the clinic 1H2025 starting with Bria-Pros (prostate cancer) 

BriaCell is currently developing
 the proprietary Bria-OTS+ platform as the company pursues the development of Bria-BRES+ , Bria-LUNG+ and Bria-MEL+ ,
 for breast cancer, lung cancer and melanoma, respectively. 

IND filings for these immunotherapy cell
 lines are anticipated starting in 2025. 

Early
Phase Programs 

On
August 4, 2022, BriaCell announced that it has secured an exclusive license from University of Maryland, Baltimore County UMBC to develop
and commercialize Soluble CD80 sCD80 as a biologic agent for the treatment of cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, BriaCell has
the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize sCD80, while UMBC maintains ownership of the patents. BriaCell will pay royalties to
UMBC upon the commercialization of the product plus patent management costs. The licensing agreement was coordinated by UMBC s
Office of Technology Development. 

The
patents are listed as the following: USPN 8,956,619 B2; USPN 9,650,429 B2; USPN 10,377,810 B2 

CD80
is an important co-stimulatory molecule present on antigen-presenting cells and key for activating T cells. CD80 also acts as an immune
checkpoint inhibitor. As noted in the patents, significant data has been generated showing that in animal models sCD80 is capable of
enhancing anti-cancer immune responses and shrinking tumors in model systems. The sCD80 appears to act both as an immune stimulator and
checkpoint inhibitor. This makes it an ideal candidate to combine with BriaCells s cellular immunotherapy platform. 

sCD80 project is temporarily on hold as the Company focused on its pivotal Phase 3 study. 

Marketing
and Sales Strategy 

The
product will initially be marketed to oncologists who are well-versed in the use of immunotherapy for cancer. Partnering with other pharmaceutical
companies in order to market combinations with a number of drugs is also an option that we intend to pursue. This study will utilize
a frozen formulation which consists of irradiated SV-BR-1-GM cells in viable freezing media. This formulation will permit stockpiling
of immunotherapy so that it can be sent on demand to clinical sites. The eventual goal is to reach all oncologists who treat late-stage
breast cancer, either by direct outreach or by partnering with another company that has an established presence in the oncology space. 

Our future commercial strategy
may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sale force, or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty
sales force, as well as similar strategies for regions and territories outside the United States. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives
as we approach approval for the use of our product candidates for one or more indications. 

Other
Commercial Considerations 

There
is a high unmet medical need in late-stage breast cancer, providing potential for accelerated approval of Bria-IMT . The FDA is
interested in facilitating the availability of novel therapies of patients with unmet medical needs, especially those that can target
the population most likely to respond. In addition, the FDA has granted Fast Track status to BriaCell s lead candidate,
Bria-IMT , for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. These two facts may help facilitate the accelerated approval of Bria-IMT . 

Production
and Marketing Plan 

Bria-IMT 
cells grow in simple tissue culture media and are irradiated prior to inoculation. Bria-IMT manufacturing will be performed by
Contract Manufacturing Organizations. We have been working with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies Fuji and the University
of California, Davis Health System UC Davis GMP facility, who have developed a frozen formulation where the cells are
grown, harvested and irradiated, followed by cryopreservation in a viable state. The cells are stockpiled and shipped directly to clinical
sites for inoculation. Each lot of Bria-IMT is tested for potency (i.e. GM-CSF production), identity (i.e. HER2+ and ER/PR-) and
adventitious agents to rule out contamination with infectious agents. To date, there have been no issues with these tests. Additional
manufacturing facilities have been evaluated and may be enlisted as demand grows. 

15 

Marketing
will target oncologists who are well-versed in the use of immunotherapy and especially breast cancer treatment centers. The initial target
will be patients with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer who have failed at least two prior treatment regimens. We plan to develop
the clinical data for Bria-IMT and to use this information to reach out to oncologists seeking additional therapeutic options
for their patients. We will include in this effort a physician education campaign targeting the oncologists most likely to treat metastatic
breast cancer. As these physicians become more aware of the data regarding Bria-IMT in breast cancer, we will make sure they also
understand how best to use Bria-IMT in combination with other therapies that have complementary synergistic mechanisms of action.
This will also come from the clinical studies described above focusing on combination therapy. Partnering with other pharmaceutical companies
in order to market a number of drugs is also an option that we intend to pursue. Our eventual goal is to reach all oncologists who treat
late stage breast cancer, either by direct outreach or by partnering with another company that has an established presence in the oncology
space.

Intellectual
Property 

The
proprietary nature of, and protection for, the Company s current and/or any future product candidates, processes and know-how are
important to its business, as is its ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others
from infringing its proprietary rights. The Company seeks patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for its current and future
product candidates it may develop through other technology. In order to protect its proprietary technologies, the Company relies on combinations
of applications for patent and trade secret protection, as well as confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, and third
parties.

The
Company has filed and owns or have licensed all rights in the following pending patent applications and issued patents: 

Filed
with the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO on June 14, 2004, U.S. Patent No. 7,674,456 B2, includes claims
to the following: 

1. 
 Compositions
 comprising SV-BR-1 and SV-BR-1-GM cells 

2. 
 Therapeutic
 methods of using said compositions 

On
February 27, 2017, BriaCell filed an international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) to further expand
its intellectual property portfolio underlying the Company s current and anticipated pipeline of whole-cell cancer immunotherapeutics
including Bria-IMT and Bria-OTS . The PCT application (PCT/US2017/019757) claims priority to two provisional patent applications
filed by the Company with the USPTO in 2016. It, in essence, provides the framework for additional whole-cell cancer immunotherapeutics
beyond Bria-IMT and strategies for patient-specific selection of the most likely effective whole-cell immunotherapeutic (BriaDx ).
The PCT application entered the National Phase in the second half of 2018 and was granted in Japan on June 21, 2021. 

BriaCell
was awarded an Australian patent (Patent No. 2017224232, extends to February 27, 2037) covering composition of matter and method
of use for its whole-cell cancer immunotherapy technology in Australia.). 

BriaCell
has also received an Issue Notification from the USPTO for the composition of matter and method of use of its personalized off-the-shelf
cell-based immunotherapy for cancer. The patent was issued on January 24, 2023 as US Patent No. 11,559,574 B2 with the term extending
to May 25, 2040. 

On
July 24, 2017, BriaCell obtained the exclusive license to certain patents related to PKC inhibitor technology, including patents
to specific compounds, methods of using the compounds, and methods of assessing patients regarding the compounds. These patents include
U.S. Patent No. 9,364,460, which was issued on June 14, 2016; U.S. Patent No. 9,572,793, which issued on February 21, 2017; U.S. Patent
No. 9,844,534, which was issued December 19, 2017; and EP Patent No. 2897610, which was issued on January 10, 2018. 

To
the knowledge of the Company s management, there are no contested proceedings or third-party claims over any of our patent applications.
Our success depends upon our ability to protect our technologies through intellectual property agreements including patents, trademarks,
know-how, and confidentiality agreements. However, there can be no assurance that the above-mentioned patent applications will be approved
by the appropriate agencies. 

All
of the technology for which patents are currently sought is owned by the Company. Our patents are entirely owned or exclusively licensed
by the Company.

the conduct of our business. 

During the year ended July 31, 2024, we purchased certain laboratory equipment in the gross amount of 456,801. 

Government
Regulation 

The
FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among
other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging,
storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting
of biologics such as those we are developing. Along with third-party contractors, we will be required to navigate the various preclinical,
clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies
or seek approval or licensure of our current or future product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent
compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and
financial resources. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the
FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. 

The
process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

completion
 of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies 1 performed in accordance with the FDA s current Good Laboratory
 Practices GLP regulations; 

submission
 to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application IND ), which must become effective before clinical trials may
 begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 

approval
 by an independent Institutional Review Board IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is begun; 

performance
 of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product
 candidate for its intended purpose; 

preparation
 of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application BLA ), after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 

satisfactory
 completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 

a
 determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 

satisfactory
 completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced
 to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product s
 continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigations to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices
 GCP and 

FDA
 review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States,
 which must be updated annually when significant changes are made. 

The
testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for
our current or future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with
a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational
new drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies.
The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic
characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support
the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes
effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about
the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any
outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization
to begin a clinical trial. 

1
 Note that the FDA has waived the requirement for animal studies as Bria-IMT , Bria-BRES and Bria-PROS+ are
human cellular vaccines and data from animal studies would be uninterpretable. 

18 

Clinical
trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in
accordance with GCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation
in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial,
the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing
IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments.
Furthermore, an IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and
its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory
authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects
are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include
oversight by a Data Safety Monitoring Board DSMB organized by the clinical trial sponsor, which provides authorization
for whether or not a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the clinical trial,
and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects, or based on other grounds, such
as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical trial results
to public registries. 

For
purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 

Phase
 1 -The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition.
 These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product
 in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 

Phase
 2 -The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate
 the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
 Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3
 clinical trials. In some cases, the FDA will grant preliminary marketing authorization for drugs treating areas of high unmet
 medical need based on Phase 2 clinical trials. If granted, they will also require confirmatory Phase 3 evaluation post-marketing.
 BriaCell is evaluating Bria-IMT in patients with breast cancer who have failed at least two prior lines of therapy. In this
 population there is no approved therapy. Therefore, the development plan for Bria-IMT is an area of high unmet medical need. It is
 anticipated that BriaCell will not need to complete Phase 3 clinical trials prior to submitting the marketing application for
 Bria-IMT in patients with advanced breast cancer who have failed at least two prior lines of therapy. In this case, a confirmatory
 Phase 3 evaluation post-marketing will be required. It is anticipated that this would consist of a randomized, controlled clinical
 trial of Bria-IMT in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with best available therapy. However, this design is
 subject to negotiation with the FDA. 

Phase
 3 -The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically
 significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical
 trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to
 provide an adequate basis for product approval. 

Phase
 4 -In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved
 to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. 

Phase
1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance
that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete
additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize
a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must
be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing
the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate
packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo
unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

19 

BLA
Submission and Review by the FDA 

Assuming
successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development,
nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or
more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative
or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product s chemistry, manufacturing,
controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety
and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The
submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee to FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product
and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited
circumstances. 

Once
a BLA has been submitted, the FDA s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing,
or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts
the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility in which
it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product s continued safety, purity and potency.
The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA
will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it
determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent
production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or
more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing
facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.
Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy
the regulatory criteria for approval. 

The
testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete.
The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts
to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates a BLA
and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or drug substance will be produced, the FDA
may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific
prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete
and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA
may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information
and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 

If
regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be
marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy plan to mitigate risks, which could
include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient
registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling
or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with
pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA
may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product s safety and effectiveness
after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition,
new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA s policies may change,
which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 

20 

A
sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA s review and approval of new drugs
and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation
if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for
the condition. For a product candidate with Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling
basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A Fast Track designated product candidate may also qualify
for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application
for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety
or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the
application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation
does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 

Under
the Accelerated Approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to
predict clinical benefit, or a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably
likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity,
or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing
studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate
endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. 

In
addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a Breakthrough Therapy, if the product candidate is intended,
alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary
clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically
significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough
therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application. Breakthrough designation also allows
the sponsor to file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis. 

Fast
Track, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development
or approval process. 

Other
Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

Our
sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory
and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services,
and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute,
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the False Claims Act FCA ), the Veterans Health Care Act, physician payment transparency
laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional state laws similar to the foregoing. 

The
federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce
the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal
health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free
or reduced price items and services. The government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare
companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not
need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government
may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false
or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as
private payors. 

21 

The
FCA imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by
a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent,
that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought
by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result
in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. For example, the federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat
of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country,
in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained
multi-million and multibillion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal
statutes. In addition, companies have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent
decrees or corporate integrity agreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. The federal Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things,
knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly
and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement
in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Given the significant size of actual and potential
settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers 
and manufacturers compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 

In
addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare
providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively,
the Affordable Care Act ), among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments or
other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians
and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties . Certain states
also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require
the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals. 

We
may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act HITECH and their respective implementing
regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, 
defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information
in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increases the civil and criminal penalties that
may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gives state attorneys general new authority
to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney s fees and
costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in
certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect. 

If
our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, we may be subject
to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations,
exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability
to operate our business and our financial results. Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws
generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining
or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent
acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of
such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and
reputation. 

Coverage
and Reimbursement 

Sales
of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include
government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently
believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, these third-party payors
are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant
uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies
to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. Seeking coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors
can be time consuming and expensive. Moreover, a payor s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an
adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a
competitive and profitable basis. 

22 

Foreign
Regulation 

In
addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a
variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of
our products, if approved. 

Whether
or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries
prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United
States have processes that require the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human
clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application CTA must be submitted to the competent national
health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company plans to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA
is approved in accordance with a country s requirements, clinical trials may proceed in that country. 

The
requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to
country, even though there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the European Union (the E.U. member states
resulting from the national implementation of underlying E.U. legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance
with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements. 

To
obtain regulatory approval of a new drug or medicinal product in the E.U., a sponsor must obtain approval of a marketing authorization
application. The way in which a medicinal product can be approved in the E.U. depends on the nature of the medicinal product. 

The
centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the E.U., as
well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology
processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as
HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially
designated as orphan drugs and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered
medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used for human drugs which do not fall within the above
mentioned categories if the human drug (a) contains a new active substance which was not authorized in the European Community; or (b)
the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the
granting of authorization in the centralized procedure is in the interests of patients or animal health at the European Community level. 

Under
the centralized procedure in the E.U., the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is
210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions
asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use CHMP )), with adoption of the actual marketing authorization
by the European Commission thereafter. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product
is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria:
(i) the seriousness of the disease to be treated, (ii) the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and (iii) anticipation
of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed
within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter. 

The
Mutual Recognition Procedure MRP for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual
national marketing authorizations within the E.U. The MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not
obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products, and is based on the principle of recognition of
an already existing national marketing authorization by one or more member states. 

23 

The
characteristic of the MRP is that the procedure builds on an already existing marketing authorization in a member state of the E.U. that
is used as reference in order to obtain marketing authorizations in other E.U. member states. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for
a drug already exists in one or more member states of the E.U. and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other
E.U. member states by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The member state in which the marketing authorization was first
granted will then act as the reference member state. The member states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for
act as concerned member states. 

The
MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by E.U. member states of their respective national marketing authorizations.
Based on a marketing authorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member
states. In such case, the reference member state shall update its existing assessment report about the drug in 90 days. After the assessment
is completed, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling
and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary
of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement
of the agreement. 

Should
any E.U. member state refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious
risk to public health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a timeframe of 60 days, member states shall, within
the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee
for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the Commission, for the start of the decision-making process.
As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee
on Human Medicinal Products or Veterinary Medicinal Products, as appropriate. 

For
other countries outside of the E.U., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct
of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials
are conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements. 

If
we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical
trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

Plan
of Arrangement 

On
August 31, 2023, the Company closed a plan of arrangement spinout transaction (the Arrangement ). Pursuant to the Arrangement,
certain pipeline assets of the Company were spun-out to BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. BriaPro or SpinCo ), including
Bria-TILsRx and protein kinase C delta (PKC inhibitors for multiple indications including cancer (the BriaPro Assets ),
resulting in a two-third (2/3) owned subsidiary of the Company with the remaining one-third (1/3) held by the Company s shareholders.
BriaPro has acquired the entire right and interest in and to the BriaPro Assets in consideration for the issuance by BriaPro to the Company
of BriaPro s common shares. Under the terms of the Arrangement, for each common share of the Company held immediately prior to
closing, the shareholders of the Company received one common share of BriaPro, and one new common share of the Company (retiring their
old share) having the same terms and characteristics as the existing common shares of the Company. The Company s common shares
and public warrants remained listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the common shares remained listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange,
and SpinCo is an unlisted reporting issuer in Canada. As part of the Arrangement, the Company obtained a third-party independent valuation
for BriaPro which amounted to 1.75 million. Based on the number of issued shares of BriaPro, this amounts to 0.0365 per BriaPro share. 

BriaPro
is a pre-clinical stage immunotherapy company developing binding agents and proteins with the intention to boost the ability of the body s
own cancer-fighting cells to destroy cancerous tumors. Using artificial intelligence AI with ImmunoPrecise Antibodies
and Receptor AI, BriaPro will identify drug candidates. 

The
lead drug discovery candidates for BriaPro includes: 

Bria-TILsRx :
 Multi-Specific Binding Reagents - Immunotherapy for Cancer: being developed in collaboration with ImmunoPrecise Antibodies. 

Small
 Molecule Program: Protein Kinase C delta (PKC Inhibitors being developed with Receptor AI. 

24 

The
power of AI in drug candidate selection has been hailed by experts and investments in AI-driven drug discovery companies have tripled
over the past four years, reaching 24.6 billion in 2022. 2 Using AI technology to identify the next blockbuster therapies
can help eliminate some of the guesswork that typically requires hundreds of lab experiments-often spread over many years-to identify
promising molecules. 

Instead
of coming up with tens of thousands of compounds to figure out, computers suggest testing ten compounds in a lab, then getting feedback
from the lab results. The machines learn from those results to make a better prediction to provide the next hundred candidates for testing
and ultimately filter to one molecule. 

Over
the course of the next year, BriaPro expects to screen several different multi specific binding reagents for activity in vitro as well
as in mouse models of cancer. BriaPro also expects to select at least one candidate to advance into IND enabling studies. Human clinical
studies are expected to be initiated in the first half of 2025. In parallel, BriaPro will continue to optimize the structure of its proprietary
protein kinase C delta inhibitors and advance to the candidates election stage. Human clinical studies are expected to be initiated in
the second half of 2025. 

Recent
Developments 

On
January 4, 2024, BriaCell disclosed images confirming robust anti-tumor
activity in patient with Eye-Bulging metastatic breast cancer. Significant reduction of metastatic breast cancer tumor behind-the-eye
was reported after only 3 cycles. Powerful anti-tumor response associated with reduction in proptosis (eye-bulging) and reduced ocular
pain. Heavily pre-treated patient had failed 7 prior regimens including antibody-drug conjugate therapy and remains on BriaCell treatment.
MRI images showed the tumor in the right orbit behind the eye with the eye not being visible pre-treatment. After treatment with the Bria-IMT 
regimen, the eye becomes visible as it has regained its normal position. Reduction in tumor size was also seen. Images of this patient
are shown further below. 

On February 6, 2024, BriaCell
announced initiation of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) of its lead candidate for treating prostate cancer, Bria-Pros+ , part
of the Bria-OTS+ platform of cellular immunotherapies. GMP manufacturing of Bria-Pros+ will provide clinical supplies for planned clinical
trial use. As presented at the Society for the Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) meeting 2023, the pre-clinical proof-of-concept data demonstrated
both feasibility and efficacy of BriaCell s platform of cellular cancer vaccines overall, with specific emphasis on Bria-Pros+.
BriaCell genetically engineers cancer cell lines to produce cytokines and co-stimulatory factors that significantly increase immune stimulation
compared to the unmodified (parent) cancer cell lines. These cell lines also express patient-specific Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) alleles
and potentially provide personalized off the shelf treatment. 

On February
7, 2024, BriaCell announced strong clinical data in breast cancer patients, and reported another notable responder case. Disease control
rate of 61 was observed in evaluable Phase 2 patients treated with the same formulation in BriaCell s pivotal Phase 3 study. Disease
control rate of 50 in evaluable patients treated with the Phase 3 formulation who failed prior antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy.
Notable responder had failed 4 prior therapies including ADC therapy with metastatic liver tumor no longer observed following
BriaCell treatment. 

On
March 7, 2024, BriaCell announced that it had received and executed a letter of intent with Paula Pohlmann, MD, MSc, PhD, Associate Professor,
Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics and Breast Medical Oncology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX to advance the clinical development of Bria-OTS+ and Bria-PROS+, BriaCell s personalized off-the-shelf
cellular cancer vaccines in advanced breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively. 

On
April 9, 2024, BriaCell presented positive clinical data demonstrating unmatched progression-free-survival (PFS) and clinical efficacy
in antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) resistant and central nervous system (CNS) metastatic breast cancer at two posters at the 2024 American
Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. Progression fee survival of 4.2 months reported in Phase 2 ADC resistant patients
who received Bria-IMT pivotal Phase 3 formulation was twice that of controls in similar studies 1 . Progression-free-survival
results were reinforced by larger number of prior treatments in Bria-IMT population than in comparable studies. Bria-IMT 
PFS compared favorably to patients most recent treatment PFS in 48 of patients. Additionally, Clinical benefit rate of 56 was
reported in evaluable patients. Finally, 71 intracranial objective response rate (iORR) was reported in heavily pretreated patients.
Findings supported clinical efficacy of Bria-IMT and highlighted its significant potential in managing CNS metastatic disease
in advanced breast cancer.

On
April 10, 2024, BriaCell reported preclinical data showing strong anti-cancer activity of its next generation, personalized, off-the-shelf,
cell-based breast and prostate cancer clinical candidates, Bria-OTS+ and Bria-PROS+ , in a poster session during the 2024
AACR Annual Meeting. 

Preclinical data showed that BriaCell s Bria-OTS+ and Bria-PROS+ effectively induced an anti-cancer
immune response via multiple mechanisms including na ve helper and killer T cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.
BriaCell hypothesizes that the novel mechanisms of action may lead to strong anti-cancer activity in breast and prostate cancer patients. 

On
April 24, 2024, BriaCell announced an oral presentation on the clinical data of the randomized Phase 2 study evaluating Bria-IMT 
in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting taking place May 31
 June 4 at McCormick Place, Chicago, IL. Principal Investigator and Professor of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Saranya Chumsri, MD, provided
the presentation. 

Copies
of the poster presentations and abstracts are posted on https://briacell.com/scientific- publications/. 

On May 24, 2024, BriaCell announced
doubling of progression-free-survival (PFS) and reported clinical benefit data at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).
83 intracranial objective response rate (iORR) with Bria-IMT was reported in heavily pretreated advanced breast cancer patients
with CNS metastases. Median progression free survival (PFS) of 4.1 months in ADC resistant patients - doubled the PFS of patients in similar
studies 1,2, 3 . 

Clinical benefit rate of 55 in
evaluable patients includes HR+, HER2+ and TNBC disease - much higher than comparable studies 1,2, 3 . 

On
May 28, 2024, BriaCell announced a clinical supply agreement with BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ: BGNE) BeiGene to evaluate the
safety and efficacy of Bria-OTS , BriaCell s next generation immunotherapy, in combination with BeiGene s anti-PD-1
antibody, tislelizumab, for the treatment of advanced heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer. 

On
May 30, 2024, BriaCell announced the initiation of a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 study evaluating safety and efficacy of Bria-OTS ,
BriaCell s personalized off-the-shelf next generation immunotherapy, as monotherapy and in combination with PD-1 inhibitor tislelizumab,
in metastatic breast cancer. 

On June 3, 2024, BriaCell presented clinical efficacy data at the 2024
ASCO annual meeting. BriaCell doubled progression-free-survival (PFS) and clinical benefit rate vs historical results in the literature.
Bria-IMT PFS compared favorably to PFS of most recent treatment in 48 of Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) resistant patients. Therapy
was well-tolerated with no Bria-IMT related discontinuations. Clinical data highlighted significant potential of Bria-IMT 
in advanced metastatic breast cancer. Superiority of selected Phase 3 regimen and formulation was confirmed. Oral presentation by Mayo
Clinic Professor and Principal Investigator, Saranya Chumsri, MD, was performed. 

Oral
Presentation Summary 

Abstract

Title:
Outcomes of advanced/metastatic breast cancer (aMBC) treated with Bria-IMT , an allogeneic whole cell
immunotherapy. 

Session Type and Title: Rapid Oral Abstract Breast Cancer Metastatic 
Session Date and Time: 6/3/2024; 11:30 AM-1:00 PM CDT 

This
presentation details the results of BriaCell s randomized Phase 2 study of Bria-IMT in combination with retifanlimab, an
immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI). The goal of randomization was to compare whether administration of the CPI early, in the first cycle
of therapy, or later, late in the second cycle of therapy, offered any advantage. Two different formulations of Bria-IMT were
also evaluated; one treated with interferon gamma and one untreated. 

The
patients entering the study were very heavily pretreated and had failed multiple prior therapies as shown in the Table 1 below.

A total of 54 patients were included in the Phase 1/2 study. Nearly half of these had been treated previously with an antibody drug conjugate
and had progressed in their disease following this treatment. Another 20 had failed a prior immune checkpoint inhibitor. Nearly 2/3
of the patients had failed therapy with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. On average they had failed six prior therapy attempts. 

26 

In
the Phase 2 portion of the study, there were 32 patients with 16 treated with CPI early and 16 treated with CPI late. There was no statistically
significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) two groups. However, a slight advantage in the CPI early group has led this
to be the selected regimen for the Phase 3 study. In the entire Phase 1/2 experience, with 54 patients, the formulation not incubated
with interferon gamma showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS. Therefore, this formulation was selected for the Phase 3
study. The data are shown in Figure 1.

Clinical
benefit was seen in 55 of evaluable patients across all subtypes of breast cancer as shown in Figure 2 below. 

Figure
2: Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) in the Bria-IMT Phase 1/2 Study 

The
progression free survival rate and the clinical benefit rate as well as the objective response rate were markedly higher than those of
similar patients treated with the treatment of their physician s choice in other studies. Notably, Treatment of Physician s
Choice (TPC) will be the comparator in the Phase 3 study of Bria-IMT . This is noted in Table 2 below.

On
July 18, 2024, BriaCell reported significantly higher PFS for its top responder patient in the Phase 2 study of BriaCell s Bria-IMT 
regimen in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in metastatic breast cancer. The patient remains alive and she continues to
receive BriaCell s treatment regimen. 

On
September 10, 2024, BriaCell announced that it received positive feedback from its Pre-Investigational New Drug Application Pre-IND meeting with the FDA for Bria-PROS+ in prostate cancer. As a result of the Pre-IND meeting, the FDA waived the animal toxicology
and animal pharmacokinetic (PK) studies requirement for opening the IND, greatly simplifying the development pathway for Bria-PROS+ .
Other areas of discussion included BriaCell s plan to initiate the Phase 1/2 study pending completion of standard manufacturing
and testing requirements. 

On
September 11, 2024, BriaCell reported positive updated overall survival data in its Phase 2 clinical study of Bria-IMT in combination
with a CPI in late stage metastatic breast cancer. Median overall survival of 15.6 months in Phase 2 Bria-IMT study patients treated
in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor was reported. Overall survival of 15.6 months compares favorably with 6.7-9.3 months
reported for similar patients in the literature. The Company s ongoing Phase 3 study is investigating Bria-IMT in
similar metastatic breast cancer population. No drug related discontinuations have been reported to date. 

On
September 12, 2024, the Company closed a registered direct offering for the purchase and sale of 12,325,000 common shares of the Company
for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 8.5 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. In addition,
the Company issued 616,250 placement agent warrants. The placement agent warrants have a term of five years commencing September 11,
2024, are exercisable commencing March 11, 2025, and have an exercise price of 0.8625 per common share. 

On
September 18, 2024, BriaCell announced FDA-Authorized expanded access policy for metastatic breast cancer patients. The FDA has
authorized the Expanded Access Policy (EAP) to help metastatic breast cancer patients in need for novel treatments. Expanded access policy
is expected to provide potential lifesaving Bria-IMT to those cancer patients in need beyond the scope of BriaCell s
pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. 

28 

On
October 1, 2024, BriaCell reported 100 resolution of brain metastasis in breast cancer patient with Eye-Bulging tumor. Dramatic
anti-tumor response included complete resolution of right temporal lobe brain metastasis in patient with Eye-Bulging metastatic
breast cancer. Heavily pre-treated patient had failed 8 prior regimens including antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy and continued
to receive BriaCell treatment. 

Figure
1: Bria-IMT regimen resulted in 100 resolution of tumor in the right temporal lobe region of the brain 

As
shown in Figure 1, the right temporal lobe lesion is no longer detectable on the images taken at 8 months and 11 months on the Bria-IMT 
combination regimen. The orbital lesion has continued to shrink markedly (Figure 2). In addition, her tumor markers (blood tests that
correlate with the amount of tumor in the body) remain markedly decreased from her pre-treatment levels. 

Figure
2: Bria-IMT regimen resulted in near complete resolution of breast cancer tumor in the right orbit (behind the eye) 

On
October 2, 2024, the Company closed a registered direct offering for the purchase and sale of 5,128,500 common shares of the Company and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate
of 5,128,000 common shares of the Company for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 5.0 million before deducting placement agent
fees and other offering expenses (the October 2024 Offering ). Each common share was sold together with one warrant to purchase
one common share at a combined purchase price of 0.975. The warrants have an exercise price of 0.85 per share, and are immediately
exercisable for a period of five years from grant date. In addition, the Company issued 256,425 placement agent warrants. The placement
agent warrants are immediately exercisable for a period of five years from grant date at an exercise price of 1.21875.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

An
investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. An investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well
as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not
presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks
actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our securities
could decline, and investors in our company may lose all or part of their investment. 

Risks
Related to Our Business 

We
have a history of losses, may incur future losses and may not achieve profitability 

BriaCell
is a development stage immune-oncology biotechnology corporation that to date has not recorded any revenues from the sale of diagnostic
or therapeutic products. Since incorporation, BriaCell has accumulated net losses and expects such losses to continue as it commences
product and pre-clinical development and eventually enters into license agreements for its technology. We incurred net losses of 4,791,466
and 20,302,394 in the fiscal years ended 2024 and 2023, respectively. Management expects to continue to incur substantial operating
losses unless and until such time as product sales generate sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations. BriaCell has neither a
history of earnings nor has it paid any dividends, and it is unlikely to pay dividends or enjoy earnings in the immediate or foreseeable
future. 

There
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 

The
Company has incurred significant losses since its inception, including net losses of 4,791,466 and 20,302,394 in the fiscal years ended
2024 and 2023, respectively, and an accumulated deficit of 85,443,697 and 80,652,231 as of July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, respectively.
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate positive cash flows from operations and to secure additional
sources of equity and/or debt financing. Despite the Company s intent to fund operations through equity and debt financing arrangements,
there is no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. 

This going concern risk may materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of new debt
or equity or may adversely affect the terms upon which such capital may be available. The inability to obtain sufficient financing on
acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and business
prospects. 

The
Company is actively pursuing strategies to mitigate these risks, focusing on transitioning towards revenue generation from its existing
product offerings and expanding its customer base. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prove successful or that
the Company will achieve its intended financial stability. The failure to successfully address these going concern risks may materially
and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Investors should consider the substantial
risks and uncertainties inherent in the Company s business before investing in the Company s securities. 

We
are a pre-revenue clinical stage company 

The
Company is developing novel technologies that may not be efficacious or safe. The Company expects to spend a significant amount of capital
to fund research and development. As a result, the Company expects that its operating expenses will increase significantly and, consequently,
it will need to generate significant revenues to become profitable. Even if the Company does become profitable, it may not be able to
sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The Company cannot predict when, if ever, it will be profitable. There
can be no assurances that the intellectual property of BriaCell, or other technologies it may acquire, will meet applicable regulatory
standards, obtain required regulatory approvals, be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs, or be successfully
marketed. The Company will be undertaking additional laboratory studies or trials with respect to the intellectual property of BriaCell,
and there can be no assurance that the results from such studies or trials will result in a commercially viable product or will not identify
unwanted side effects. 

30 

We
have an unproven market for our product candidates 

The
Company believes that the anticipated market for its potential products and technologies if successfully developed will continue to exist
and expand. These assumptions may prove to be incorrect for a variety of reasons, including competition from other products and the degree
of commercial viability of the potential product. 

We
may not succeed in adapting to and meeting the business needs associated with our anticipated growth 

Anticipated
growth in all areas of BriaCell s business is expected to continue to place a significant strain on its managerial, operational
and technical resources. The Company expects operating expenses and staffing levels to increase in the future. To manage such growth,
the Company must expand its operational and technical capabilities and manage its employee base while effectively administering multiple
relationships with various third parties. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to manage its expanding operations
effectively. Any failure to implement cohesive management and operating systems, to add resources on a cost-effective basis or to properly
manage the Company s expansion could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. 

BriaPro
may not generate revenue as expected 

We
are a majority shareholder of BriaPro. BriaPro may not generate financial returns or may not yield the desired business outcome. The
success of our investment in a company is sometimes dependent on the availability of additional funding on favorable terms or a liquidity
event such as an initial public offering. We may record impairment charges in relation to our strategic investments which will have a
negative impact on our financial position. 

This
may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. This could impact our return on our investment.
In the event BriaPro fails to generate revenue, this may erode or dilute its value to our shareholders. 

We
are heavily reliant on third-parties to carry out a large portion of our business 

The
Company does not expect to have any in-house manufacturing, pharmaceutical development or marketing capability. To be successful, a product
must be manufactured and packaged in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and in reasonable time frames and
at accepted costs. The Company intends to contract with third parties to develop its products. No assurance can be given that the Company
or its suppliers will be able to meet the supply requirements in respect of the product development or commercial sales. 

Production
of therapeutic products may require raw materials for which the sources and amount of supply are limited, or may be hindered by quality
or scheduling issues in respect of the third party suppliers over which the Company has limited control. An inability to obtain adequate
supplies of raw materials could significantly delay the development, regulatory approval and marketing of a product. The Company has
limited in-house personnel to internally manage all aspects of product development, including the management of multi-center clinical
trials. The Company is significantly reliant on third-party consultants and contractors to provide the requisite advice and management.
There can be no assurance that the clinical trials and product development will not encounter delays which could adversely affect prospects
for the Company s success. 

To
be successful, an approved product must also be successfully marketed. The market for the Company s product being developed by
the Company may be large and will require substantial sales and marketing capability. At the present time, the Company does not have
any internal capability to market pharmaceutical products. The Company intends to enter into one or more strategic partnerships or collaborative
arrangements with pharmaceutical companies or other companies with marketing and distribution expertise to address this need. If necessary,
the Company will establish arrangements with various partners for geographical areas. There can be no assurance that the Company can
market, or can enter into a satisfactory arrangement with a third party to market a product in a manner that would assure its acceptance
in the marketplace. However, if a satisfactory arrangement with a third party to market and/or distribute a product is obtained; the
Company will be dependent on the corporate collaborator(s) who may not devote sufficient time, resources and attention to the Company s
programs, which may hinder efforts to market the products. 

31 

Should
the Company not establish marketing and distribution strategic partnerships and collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms, and undertake
some or all of those functions, the Company will require significant additional human and financial resources and expertise to undertake
these activities, the availability of which is not guaranteed. The Company will rely on third parties for the timely supply of raw materials,
equipment, contract manufacturing, and formulation or packaging services. Although the Company intends to manage these third-party relationships
to ensure continuity and quality, some events beyond the Company s control could result in complete or partial failure of these
goods and services. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on the financial conditions and result of operation of the
Company. 

Due
to the complexity of the process of developing pharmaceutical products, the Company s business may depend on arrangements with
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, corporate and academic collaborators, licensors, licensees and others for the research, development,
clinical testing, technology rights, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of its products. Such agreements could obligate the
Company to diligently bring potential products to market, make milestone payments and royalties that, in some instances, could be substantial,
and incur the costs of filing and prosecuting patent applications. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to establish
or maintain collaborations that are important to its business on favorable terms, or at all. 

A
number of risks arise from the Company s potential dependence on collaborative agreements with third parties. Product development
and commercialization efforts could be adversely affected if any collaborative partner terminates or suspends its agreement with the
Company, causes delays, fails to on a timely basis develop or manufacture in adequate quantities a substance needed in order to conduct
clinical trials, fails to adequately perform clinical trials, determines not to develop, manufacture or commercialize a product to which
it has rights, or otherwise fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company s collaborative partners could pursue other
technologies or develop alternative products that could compete with the products the Company is developing. 

The
Company has signed Non-Disclosure Agreements NDA with many different third parties. As is customary in the industry.
There is no guarantee that, despite the terms of the NDA which bind third parties, the Company will ultimately be able to prevent from
such third parties from breaching their obligations under the NDA. Use of the Company s confidential information in an unauthorized
manner is likely to negatively affect the Company. 

Pre-clinical
studies and initial clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results 

Pre-clinical
tests and Phase 1/2 clinical trials are primarily designed to test safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and to understand
the side effects of product candidates at various doses and schedules. Success in pre-clinical and early clinical trials does not ensure
that later large-scale efficacy trials will be successful, nor does it predict final results. Favorable results in early trials may not
be repeated in later trials. 

A
number of companies in the life sciences industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after positive
results in earlier trials. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory
approvals. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be delayed,
repeated or terminated. Any pre-clinical data and the clinical results obtained for BriaCell s technology may not predict results
from studies in larger numbers of subjects drawn from more diverse populations or in the commercial setting, and also may not predict
the ability of our products to achieve their intended goals, or to do so safely. 

An
inability to obtain raw materials or product supply could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition
and results of operations 

Raw
materials and supplies are generally available in quantities to meet the needs of the Company s business. The Company will be dependent
on third-party manufacturers for the pharmaceutical products that it markets An inability to obtain raw materials or product supply could
have a material adverse impact on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

32 

We
must obtain additional capital to continue our operations 

The
Company anticipates that additional capital will be required to complete its current research and development programs. It is anticipated
that future research, additional pre-clinical and toxicology studies and manufacturing initiatives, including to prepare for market approval
and successful product market launch, will require additional funds. Further financing may dilute the current holdings of shareholders
and may thereby result in a loss for the shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financing,
or financing on terms that are reasonable or acceptable for these or other purposes, or to fulfill the Company s obligations under
various license agreements. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further research
and development of the Company s technologies with the possible loss of license rights to these technologies. 

We
are highly dependent on our key personnel 

Although
the Company is expected to have experienced senior management and personnel, the Company will be substantially dependent upon the services
of a few key personnel, particularly Dr. William V. Williams, Dr. Giuseppe Del Priore, Dr. Miguel Lopez-Lago and other professionals
for the successful operation of its business. Pivotal Phase 3 of Bria-IMT regimen with an immune check point inhibitor, and Phase
1/2 study of Bria-OTS , and the Company s research and product development is planned to be completed by qualified professionals
and is expected to concentrate on treatment of advanced breast cancer and prostate cancer. The loss of the services of any of these personnel
could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. The Company may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable
terms given the intense competition for such personnel among high technology enterprises, including biotechnology and healthcare companies,
universities and non-profit research institutions. If we lose any of these persons, or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel,
our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

BriaCell
in the future may acquire businesses, products or technologies that it believes complement or expand its existing business. 

Acquisitions
of this type involve a number of risks, including the possibility that the operations of the acquired business will not be profitable
or that the attention of the Company s management will be diverted from the day-to-day operation of its business. An unsuccessful
acquisition could reduce the Company s margins or otherwise harm its financial condition. 

If
the Company experiences a data security breach and confidential information is disclosed, the Company may be subject to penalties and
experience negative publicity 

The
Company and its customers could suffer harm if personal and health information were accessed by third parties due to a system security
failure. The collection of data requires the Company to receive and store a large amount of personally de-identifiable data. Recently, data
security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention, prompting
legislative proposals addressing data privacy and security. The Company may become exposed to potential liabilities with respect to the
data that it collects, manages and processes, and may incur legal costs if information security policies and procedures are not effective
or if the Company is required to defend its methods of collection, processing and storage of personal data. Future investigations, lawsuits
or adverse publicity relating to its methods of handling such information could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, financial condition and results of operations due to the costs and negative market reaction relating to such developments. 

33 

We
may not succeed in completing the development of our products, commercializing our products or generating significant revenues 

Since
commencing our operations, we have focused on the research and development and limited clinical trials of our product candidates. Our
ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability depends on our ability to successfully complete the development of our products,
obtain market approval and generate significant revenues. The future success of our business cannot be determined at this time, and we
do not anticipate generating revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. In addition, we face a number of challenges with
respect to our future commercialization efforts, including, among others, that: 

we may not have adequate
 financial or other resources to complete the development of our product, including two stages of clinical development that are necessary
 in order to commercialize our products; 

we
 may not be able to manufacture our products in commercial quantities, at an adequate quality or at an acceptable cost; 

we
 may not be able to maintain our CE mark due to regulatory changes; 

we
 may never receive FDA or Health Canada approval for our intended development plans; 

we
 may not be able to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution channels; 

healthcare
 professionals and patients may not accept our product candidates; 

technological
 breakthroughs in cancer detection, treatment and prevention may reduce the demand for our product candidates; 

changes
 in the market for cancer treatment, new alliances between existing market participants and the entrance of new market participants
 may interfere with our market penetration efforts; 

third-party
 payors may not agree to reimburse patients for any or all of the purchase price of our products, which may adversely affect patients 
 willingness to purchase our product candidates; 

uncertainty
 as to market demand may result in inefficient pricing of our product candidates; 

we
 may face third-party claims of intellectual property infringement; 

we
 may fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products candidates in our target markets or may face adverse regulatory
 or legal actions relating to our product candidates even if regulatory approval is obtained; and 

we
 are dependent upon the results of ongoing clinical studies relating to our product candidates and the products of our competitors.
 We may fail in obtaining positive results. 

If
we are unable to meet any one or more of these challenges successfully, our ability to effectively commercialize our product candidates
could be limited, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

34 

If
product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and the commercialization of our drug candidates
may be affected 

As
our drug candidates are currently in clinical trials, we face an inherent risk of product liability suits and will face an even greater
risk if we obtain approval to commercialize any drugs. For example, we may be sued if our drug candidates cause or are perceived to cause
injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability
claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the drug, negligence,
strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully
defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of
our drug candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or
eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: 

decreased demand for our
 drugs; 

injury to our reputation; 

withdrawal of clinical
 trial participants and inability to continue clinical trials; 

initiation of investigations
 by regulators; 

costs to defend the related
 litigation; 

diversion of management s
 time and our resources; 

substantial monetary awards
 to trial participants or patients; 

product recalls, withdrawals
 or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; 

loss of revenue; 

exhaustion of any available
 insurance and our capital resources; 

the inability to commercialize
 any drug candidate; and 

a decline in the price
 of our common shares. 

We
believe that we currently have appropriate insurance covering clinical trials. However, it may transpire that the amount of such insurance
coverage may not be adequate, we may be unable to maintain such insurance, or we may not be able to obtain additional or replacement
insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. Any inability to maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to
protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of drugs we develop, alone or with
collaborators. Our insurance policies may also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which
we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations
or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Even if
our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against losses, such indemnification may not be
available or adequate should any claim arise. 

35 

Additionally,
we may be sued if the products that we commercialize, market or sell cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise
unsuitable, and may result in: 

decreased demand for those
 products; 

damage to our reputation; 

costs incurred related
 to product recalls; 

limiting our opportunities
 to enter into future commercial partnerships; and 

a decline in the price
 of our common shares. 

Global
economic uncertainty and financial market volatility caused by political instability, changes in international trade relationships and
conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and rising tensions in the Middle East, could make it more difficult for us
to access financing and could adversely affect our business and operations. 

Our
ability to raise capital is subject to the risk of adverse changes in the market value of our stock. Periods of macroeconomic weakness
or recession and heightened market volatility caused by adverse geopolitical developments could increase these risks, potentially resulting
in adverse impacts on our ability to raise further capital on favorable terms. The impact of geopolitical tension, such as the war in
the Middle East, a deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the US and China or an escalation in conflict between Russia and
Ukraine, including any resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be imposed by the US and/or other countries
against governmental or other entities in, for example, Russia, also could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in global trade
patterns, which may in turn impact our ability to source necessary reagents, raw materials and other inputs for our research and development
operations. 

We
may be adversely affected by the effects of inflation. 

Inflation
has the potential to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity by increasing our overall
cost structure, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence
of inflation in the economy has the potential to result in higher interest rates and capital costs, supply shortages, increased costs
of labor and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we may experience increases in the costs of labor, materials, and other
inputs, such as engineering consultants. Although we may take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation, if these measures are
not effective our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Even if such
measures are effective, there could be a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations
and when the cost inflation is incurred. 

36 

A
material breach in security relating to the Company s information systems and regulation related to such breaches, cyber-attacks,
or other disruptions could adversely affect the Company, expose us to liability and affect our business and reputation. 

Information
security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the
Internet, and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, cybercriminals and other
external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming
more sophisticated and include malicious software, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security
breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information
and corruption of data, substantially damaging the Company s reputation. Any person who circumvents the security measures could
steal proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in the Company s operations. 

We
are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We, our collaborators and our service
providers collect, store, and transmit sensitive information including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal
information in connection with our business operations. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and
business strategy. Some of this information could be an attractive target of criminal attack by third parties with a wide range of motives
and expertise, including organized criminal groups, hacktivists, disgruntled current or former employees, nation-state
and nation-state supported actors, and others. Cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, and despite our security
measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to such attacks or may be breached, including due to employee
error or malfeasance. 

We
have implemented information security measures to protect our systems, proprietary information, and sensitive data against the risk of
inappropriate and unauthorized external use and disclosure and other types of compromise. However, despite these measures, and due to
the ever-changing information cyber-threat landscape, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be adequate to detect, prevent or
mitigate security breaches and other incidents and we may be subject to data breaches through cyber-attacks, malicious code (such as
viruses and worms), phishing attacks, social engineering schemes, and insider theft or misuse. Any such breach could compromise our networks
and the information stored there could be accessed, modified, destroyed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. If our systems become compromised,
we may not promptly discover the intrusion. 

Any
security breach or other incident, whether real or perceived, could cause us to suffer reputational damage. Such incidents could result
in costs to respond to, investigate and remedy such incidents, notification obligations to affected individuals, government agencies,
credit reporting agencies and other third parties, legal claims or proceedings, and liability under our contracts with other parties
and federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information. The Company s failure to prevent security
breaches, or well-publicized security breaches affecting the Internet in general, could significantly harm the Company s reputation
and business and financial results. 

37 

Risks
Related to Our Intellectual Property 

We
may not successfully develop, maintain and protect our proprietary products and technologies 

BriaCell s
success depends to a significant degree upon its ability to develop, maintain and protect proprietary products and technologies. BriaCell
files patent applications in the United States and other countries as part of its global strategy to protect its intellectual property
and maintains certain U.S. and Non-U.S. patents in its intellectual property portfolio. However, patents provide only limited protection
of BriaCell s intellectual property. The assertion of patent protection involves complex legal and factual determinations and is
therefore uncertain and can be expensive. BriaCell cannot provide assurances that patents will be granted with respect to any of its
pending patent applications, or that the scope of any of its granted patents, or any patents granted in the future, will be sufficiently
broad to offer meaningful protection, or that it will develop and file patent applications on additional proprietary technologies that
are patentable, or, if patentable, that any patents will be granted from such patent applications. BriaCell s current or future
patents could be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented. This could result in BriaCell s patent rights failing to
create an effective competitive barrier. Losing a significant patent or failing to get a patent to issue from a pending patent application
that BriaCell considers significant could have a material adverse effect on BriaCell s business. The laws governing the scope of
patent coverage in various countries continue to evolve. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect BriaCell s intellectual
property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. BriaCell has applied for patent protection only in selected countries.
Therefore, third parties may be able to replicate BriaCell technologies covered by BriaCell s patent portfolio in countries in
which it does not have patent protection. 

BriaCell s
future success and competitive position depends in part upon its ability to maintain its intellectual property portfolio. There can be
no assurance that any patents will be issued on any existing or future patent applications. 

We
are susceptible to intellectual property suits that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit
us from selling our product candidates 

There
is a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology industry. Whether or not
a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual considerations, the determination of which is often uncertain. Our management
is presently unaware of any other parties patents and proprietary rights which our products under development would infringe.
Searches typically performed to identify potentially infringed patents of third parties are often not conclusive and, because patent
applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending, which may later result in issued patents which our
current or future products may infringe or be alleged to infringe. In addition, our competitors or other parties may assert that our
product candidates and the methods employed may be covered by patents held by them. If any of our products infringes a valid patent,
we could be prevented from manufacturing or selling such product unless we are able to obtain a license or able to redesign the product
in such a manner as to avoid infringement. A license may not always be available or may require us to pay substantial royalties. We also
may not be successful in any attempt to redesign our product to avoid infringement, nor does a later redesign protect BriaCell from prior
infringement. Infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate
and can divert our management s attention from operating our business. 

38 

The
steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability
to compete in the market 

BriaCell s
ability to establish and maintain a competitive position may be achieved in part by prosecuting claims against others who it believes
to be infringing its rights. In addition, enforcement of BriaCell s patents in foreign jurisdictions will depend on the legal procedures
in those jurisdictions. In addition to filing patent applications, we rely on confidentiality, non-compete, non-disclosure and assignment
of inventions provisions, as appropriate, in our agreements with our employees, consultants, and service providers, to protect and otherwise
seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. These measures may not be adequate to protect our intellectual
property from unauthorized disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation, for the following reasons: 

the agreements may be breached,
 may not provide the scope of protection we believe they provide or may be determined to be unenforceable; 

we may have inadequate
 remedies for any breach; 

proprietary information
 could be disclosed to our competitors; or 

others may independently
 develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets
 or disclose such technologies. 

Specifically,
with respect to non-compete agreements, both state law and precedent varies greatly from state to state and we may be unable to enforce
these agreements, in whole or in part, and it may be difficult for us to restrict our competitors from gaining the expertise that our
former employees gained while working for us. If our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated, it could harm our ability
to protect our rights and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive and,
if we lose, could cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights, which would harm our ability to compete in the market 

We
rely on patents, confidentiality and trade secrets to protect a portion of our intellectual property and our competitive position. Patent
law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, patent positions
in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry can be uncertain. In order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent
and related litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or requests for injunctive relief. BriaCell s ability
to establish and maintain a competitive position may be achieved in part by prosecuting claims against others who it believes to be infringing
its rights. In addition, enforcement of BriaCell s patents in foreign jurisdictions will depend on the legal procedures in those
jurisdictions. Any lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert our management s attention from
other business concerns and the outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets
or trademarks is highly unpredictable. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our
patent applications at risk of not issuing, or adversely affect its ability to distribute any products that are subject to such litigation.
In addition, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages
or other remedies awarded, including attorney fees, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees or contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade
secrets of their former employers 

Many
of our employees and contractors were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including
our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that we or
any employee or contractor have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of his or
her former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to
paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work
product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain therapeutic candidates, which could severely harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in
substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

39 

If
the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities approve generic versions of any of our products that receive marketing approval,
or such authorities do not grant our products appropriate periods of exclusivity before approving generic versions of our products, the
sales of our products could be adversely affected. 

Once
a new drug application is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a reference listed drug in the FDA s publication,
 Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Manufacturers may seek
approval of generic versions of reference listed drugs through submission of abbreviated new drug applications in the United States.
In support of an abbreviated new drug applications, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical trials. Rather, the applicant generally
must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use or
labeling as the reference listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug, meaning it is absorbed
in the body at the same rate and to the same extent. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the reference
listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower prices. Thus, following the introduction
of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product or reference listed drug is typically lost to the generic
product. 

The
FDA may not approve abbreviated new drug applications for a generic product until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for
the reference listed drug has expired. The United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provides a period of five years of non-patent
exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity NCE ). Specifically, in cases where such exclusivity has been
granted, abbreviated new drug applications may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five years, unless the submission
is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification that a patent covering the reference listed drug is either invalid or will not be infringed
by the generic product, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following approval of the reference listed
drug. 

While
we believe that our products contain active ingredients that would be treated as NCEs by the FDA and, therefore, if approved, should
be afforded five years of data exclusivity, the FDA may disagree with that conclusion and may approve generic products after a period
that is less than five years. If the FDA were to award NCE exclusivity to someone other than us, we believe that we would still be awarded
three year Other exclusivity protection from generic competition, which is awarded when an application or supplement contains
reports of new clinical investigations (not bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by an applicant and essential for approval.
Manufacturers may seek to launch these generic products following the expiration of the applicable marketing exclusivity period, even
if we still have patent protection for our product. If we do not maintain patent protection and data exclusivity for our product candidates,
our business may be materially harmed. 

Competition
that our products may face from generic versions of our products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability
and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those product candidates. 

Patent
terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time. 

Patents
have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally
20 years from its earliest United States non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent,
and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired,
we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the
development, testing, and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly
after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights
to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. 

40 

Risks
Related to Regulations 

Changes
in legislation and regulations may affect our revenue and profitability 

Existing
and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies may cause the Company to incur increased costs as the Company
evaluates the implications of new rules and responds to new requirements. Failure to comply with new rules and regulations could result
in enforcement actions or the assessment of other penalties. New laws and regulations could make it more difficult to obtain certain
types of insurance, including director s and officer s liability insurance, and the Company may be forced to accept reduced
policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage, to the extent that such coverage
remains available. 

The
impact of these events could also make it more difficult for the Company to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the Board,
or as executive officers. The Company may be required to hire additional personnel and utilize additional outside legal, accounting and
advisory services, all of which could cause the Company s general and administrative costs to increase beyond what the Company
currently has planned. Although the Company evaluates and monitors developments with respect to new rules and laws, the Company cannot
predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs the Company may incur or the timing of such costs with respect to such evaluations
and/or compliance and cannot provide assurances that such additional costs will render the Company compliant with such new rules and
laws. 

If
we or our licensees are unable to obtain U.S., Canadian and/or foreign regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable
to commercialize our therapeutic candidates 

To
date, we have not marketed, distributed or sold an approved product. Our therapeutic candidates are subject to extensive governmental
regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization of drugs. We may not obtain marketing approval
for any of our therapeutic candidates in a timely manner or at all. In connection with the clinical trials for our product candidates
and other therapeutic candidates that we may seek to develop in the future, either on our own or throughout licensing arrangements, we
face the risk that: 

a product candidate may
 not prove safe or efficacious; 

the results with respect
 to any product candidate may not confirm the positive results from earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

the results may not meet
 the level of statistical significance required by the FDA, Health Canada or other regulatory authorities; and 

the results will justify
 only limited and/or restrictive uses, including the inclusion of warnings and contraindications, which could significantly limit
 the marketability and profitability of the therapeutic candidate. 

Any
delay or failure in obtaining the required regulatory approvals will materially and adversely affect our ability to generate future revenues
from a particular product candidate. Any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses
for which we may market the product or may impose restrictive conditions of use, including cautionary information, thereby limiting the
size of the market for the product. We and our licensees, as applicable, also are, and will be, subject to numerous foreign regulatory
requirements that govern the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement.
The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process that we describe above, as
well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities
outside the United States. Foreign jurisdictions may have different approval processes than those required by the FDA and may impose
additional testing requirements for our therapeutic candidates. 

41 

If
the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and clinical development do not perform as contractually required or
expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, or commercialize, our product candidates 

We
do not have the ability to independently conduct our clinical trials for our product candidates and we must rely on third parties, such
as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct such trials. If
these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these
third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere
to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials
may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance for, or successfully commercialize,
our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected. Furthermore,
our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control. 

Modifications
to our product candidates, or to any other product candidates that we may develop in the future, may require new regulatory clearances
or approvals or may require us or our licensees, as applicable, to recall or cease marketing these therapeutic candidates until clearances
are obtained 

Modifications
to our product candidates, after they have been approved for marketing, if at all, or to any other pharmaceutical product that we may
develop in the future, may require new regulatory clearance, or approvals, and, if necessitated by a problem with a marketed product,
may result in the recall or suspension of marketing of the previously approved and marketed product until clearances or approvals of
the modified product are obtained. The FDA requires pharmaceutical products manufacturers to initially make and document a determination
of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance. A manufacturer may determine in conformity with applicable
regulations and guidelines that a modification may be implemented without pre-clearance by the FDA; however, the FDA can review a manufacturer s
decision and may disagree. The FDA may also on its own initiative determine that a new clearance or approval is required. If the FDA
requires new clearances or approvals of any pharmaceutical product or medical device for which we or our licensees receive marketing
approval, if any, we or our licensees may be required to recall such product and to stop marketing the product as modified, which could
require us or our licensees to redesign the product and will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions. 

The
results of our clinical trials may not support our product claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects 

Even
if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product claims or that any
regulatory authority whose approval we will require in order to market and sell our products in any territory will agree with our conclusions
regarding them. Success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful,
and we cannot be sure that clinical trials will replicate the results of prior trials and pre-clinical studies. The clinical trial process
may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon
a product and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our regulatory
submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues. It is also possible that patients
enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate s profile. 

Clinical
trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive
of future trial results 

We
have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including FDA approval.
Clinical trials are expensive and complex, can take many years and have uncertain outcomes. We cannot predict whether we or our licensees
will encounter problems with any of the completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us, our licensees or regulatory
authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials. We estimate
that clinical trials of our most advanced therapeutic candidates will continue for several years, but they may take significantly longer
to complete. Failure can occur at any stage of the testing and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of,
the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future therapeutic candidates, including but
not limited to: 

delays in securing clinical
 investigators or trial sites for the clinical trials; 

42 

delays in obtaining institutional
 review board and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial; 

slower than anticipated
 patient recruitment and enrollment; 

negative or inconclusive
 results from clinical trials; 

unforeseen safety issues; 

uncertain dosing issues; 

an inability to monitor
 patients adequately during or after treatment; and 

problems with investigator
 or patient compliance with the trial protocols. 

A
number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience than us,
have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials. Despite
the results reported in earlier clinical trials for our therapeutic candidates, we do not know whether any Phase 3 or other clinical
trials we or our licensees may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our therapeutic
candidates. If later-stage clinical trials of any therapeutic candidate do not produce favorable results, our ability to obtain regulatory
approval for the therapeutic candidate may be adversely impacted, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

The
pharmaceutical business is subject to increasing government price controls and other restrictions on pricing, reimbursement and access
to drugs, which could adversely affect our future revenues and profitability 

To
the extent our products are developed, commercialized, and successfully introduced to market, they may not be considered cost-effective
and third-party or government reimbursement might not be available or sufficient. Globally, governmental and other third-party payors
are becoming increasingly aggressive in attempting to contain health care costs by strictly controlling, directly or indirectly, pricing
and reimbursement and, in some cases, limiting or denying coverage altogether on the basis of a variety of justifications, and we expect
pressures on pricing and reimbursement from both governments and private payors inside and outside the U.S. to continue. 

In
the U.S., we are subject to substantial pricing, reimbursement, and access pressures from state Medicaid programs, private insurance
programs and pharmacy benefit managers, and implementation of U.S. health care reform legislation is increasing these pricing pressures.
The Affordable Care Act instituted comprehensive health care reform, and includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or
limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions), and impose new and/or increased
taxes. The future of the Affordable Care Act and its constituent parts are uncertain at this time. 

In
almost all markets, pricing and choice of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to governmental control. Therefore, the price of our
products and their reimbursement in Europe and in other countries is and will be determined by national regulatory authorities. Reimbursement
decisions from one or more of the European markets may impact reimbursement decisions in other European markets. A variety of factors
are considered in making reimbursement decisions, including whether there is sufficient evidence to show that treatment with the product
is more effective than current treatments, that the product represents good value for money for the health service it provides, and that
treatment with the product works at least as well as currently available treatments. 

The
continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, and other payors of health care costs to
contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability or those of our potential customers, suppliers,
and collaborative partners, as well as the availability of capital. 

43 

United
States federal and state privacy laws, and equivalent laws of other nations, may increase our costs of operation and expose us to civil
and criminal sanctions 

HIPPA,
and the regulations that have been issued under it, and similar laws outside the United States, contains substantial restrictions and
requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information. The HIPAA privacy rules prohibit
 covered entities, such as healthcare providers and health plans, from using or disclosing an individual s protected
health information, unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the privacy
rules. Under the HIPAA security rules, covered entities must establish administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others
on their behalf. While we do not believe that we will be a covered entity under HIPAA, we believe many of our customers will be covered
entities subject to HIPAA. Such customers may require us to enter into business associate agreements, which will obligate us to safeguard
certain health information we obtain in the course of our relationship with them, restrict the manner in which we use and disclose such
information and impose liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations. 

In
addition, under HITECH, which was signed into law as part of the U.S. stimulus package in February 2009, certain of HIPAA s privacy
and security requirements are now also directly applicable to business associates of covered entities and subject them
to direct governmental enforcement for failure to comply with these requirements. We may be deemed as a business associate 
of some of our customers. As a result, we may be subject as a business associate to civil and criminal penalties for failure
to comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements. Moreover, HITECH created a new requirement obligating business
associates to report any breach of unsecured, individually identifiable health information to their covered entity customers and
imposes penalties for failing to do so. 

In
addition to HIPAA, most U.S. states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical
information, and many U.S. states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards,
security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. These U.S. state laws, which may be even more stringent than
the HIPAA requirements, are not supplanted by the federal requirements, and we are therefore required to comply with them to the extent
they are applicable to our operations. 

These
and other possible changes to HIPAA or other U.S. federal or state laws or regulations, or comparable laws and regulations in countries
where we conduct business, could affect our business and the costs of compliance could be significant. Failure by us to comply with any
of the standards regarding patient privacy, identity theft prevention and detection, and data security may subject us to penalties, including
civil monetary penalties and in some circumstances, criminal penalties. In addition, such failure may damage our reputation and adversely
affect our ability to retain customers and attract new customers. 

The
protection of personal data, particularly patient data, is subject to strict laws and regulations in many countries. The collection and
use of personal health data in the E.U. is governed by the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data
(the Data Protection Directive ). The Data Protection Directive imposes a number of requirements, including an obligation
to seek the consent of individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information that must be provided to the individuals, notification
of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities of individual E.U. member states and the security
and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out
of the E.U. to the U.S.. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive and the related national data protection
laws of the E.U. member states may result in fines and other administrative penalties and harm our business. We may incur extensive costs
in ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations, particularly if we are considered to be a data controller within the meaning
of the Data Protection Directive. 

44 

If
we fail to comply with the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state and foreign country laws, we could be subject to criminal
and civil penalties and exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs including the Medicare and Medicaid programs and equivalent
third country programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

A
provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits the knowing and willful offer,
payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the referring,
ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for, or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services payable, in
whole or in part, by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal healthcare program. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions
and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from
prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within
an exemption or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is very broad in scope and many of its provisions
have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by existing case law or regulations. In addition, most of the states have adopted
laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these laws are even broader than the federal Anti-Kickback Statute in
that their prohibitions may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, apply
regardless of the source of payment. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in substantial criminal, civil or administrative
penalties, damages, fines and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 

All
of our future financial relationships with U.S. healthcare providers, purchasers, formulary managers, and others who provide products
or services to federal healthcare program beneficiaries will potentially be governed by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar
state laws. We believe our operations will be in compliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. However, we
cannot be certain that we will not be subject to investigations or litigation alleging violations of these laws, which could be time-consuming
and costly to us and could divert management s attention from operating our business, which in turn could have a material adverse
effect on our business. In addition, if our arrangements were found to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state laws,
the consequences of such violations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. 

There
are other federal and state laws that may affect our ability to operate, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits,
among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment
of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to
pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to
pay money to the federal government. Moreover, we may be subject to other federal false claim laws, including, among others, federal
criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs. Moreover, there are analogous
state laws. Violations of these laws can result in substantial criminal, civil or administrative penalties, damages, fines and exclusion
from participation in federal healthcare programs. 

Moreover,
the provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit
companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties,
or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a
substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more aggressive and frequent investigations and
enforcement by both the SEC and the Department of Justice. A determination that our operations or activities violated U.S. or foreign
laws or regulations could result in imposition of substantial fines, interruption of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party
relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. In addition, lawsuits brought by
private litigants may also follow as a consequence. 

45 

In
both domestic and foreign markets, the development, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, handling, distribution, import,
export, licensing, sale and storage of pharmaceuticals and medical devices are affected by a body of laws, governmental regulations,
administrative determinations, including those by Health Canada and the FDA, court decisions and similar constraints. 

Such
laws, regulations and other constraints can exist at the federal, provincial or local levels in Canada and at all levels of government
in foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the Company and the Company s partners are in compliance with all of these
laws, regulations and other constraints. The Company and its partners may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such
laws and regulations in the future, and such laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on the business. The failure of the Company
or its partners to comply with current or future regulatory requirements could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims
and may have a material adverse effect on the business. In addition, the adoption of new laws, regulations or other constraints or changes
in the interpretations of such requirements might result in significant compliance costs or lead the Company and its partners to discontinue
product development and could have an adverse effect on the business. 

The
Company s international operations expose it and its representatives, agents and distributors to risks inherent to operating in
foreign jurisdictions that could materially adversely affect its operations and financial position. 

These
risks include: 

country specific taxation policies; 

imposition of additional foreign governmental controls
 or regulations; 

export license requirements; 

changes in tariffs and other trade restrictions; and 

complexity of collecting receivables in a foreign jurisdiction. 

Moreover,
applicable agreements relating to business in foreign jurisdictions are governed by foreign laws and are subject to dispute resolution
in the courts of, or through arbitration proceedings in, the country or region in which the parties are located or another jurisdiction
agreed upon by the parties. The Company cannot accurately predict whether such jurisdictions will provide an effective and efficient
means of resolving disputes that may arise in the future. Even if it obtains a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding,
the Company could have difficulty in enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis or at all. 

Risks
Related to Our Securities 

If
we are not able to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of the TSX Exchange or Nasdaq, TSX Exchange
or Nasdaq could delist our common shares 

In
order to maintain the listing of our common shares on the TSX Exchange and the Nasdaq Capital Market, we must satisfy minimum financial
and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements,
minimum stockholders equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that
we will be able to comply with such applicable listing standards. 

On
July 3, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that, based upon the Company s
Market Value of Listed Securities MVLS for the 33 consecutive business days from May 15, 2024, to July 2, 2024, the Company
did not meet the minimum MVLS of 35,000,000 required for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). The
letter also indicated that the Company will be provided with the Compliance Period of 180 calendar days, or until December 30, 2024,
in which to regain compliance pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C). If we regain compliance with the MVLS, Nasdaq will provide
written confirmation to us and close the matter. 

46 

In
the event that we do not regain compliance prior to the end of the compliance period, we will receive written notification that our securities
are subject to delisting, at which point we may appeal the delisting determination. 

In
addition, on August 22, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department notifying the Company that,
for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for the Company s common shares have been below the minimum 1.00
per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum
Bid Price Requirement ). 

In
accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been given 180 calendar days, or until February 18, 2025, to regain
compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 

If
the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by February 18, 2025, the Company may be afforded a second
180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for
market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market (which
the Company currently does not meet) with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and will need to provide written
notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during such additional compliance period, by effecting a reverse split of its common shares,
if necessary. If it appears to the Staff that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not
eligible for the additional compliance period, and the Company does not regain compliance by February 18, 2025, Nasdaq will provide written
notification to the Company that its common shares are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination
to a hearings panel pursuant to the procedures set forth in the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. 

If
Nasdaq determines to delist our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another national securities
exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders: 

the
liquidity of our common shares; 

 the
market price of our common shares; 

 our
ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations; 

 the
number of investors that will consider investing in our common shares; 

 the
number of market makers in our common shares; 

 the
availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common shares; and 

 the
number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common shares. 

Future
issuance of our common shares could dilute the interests of existing shareholders 

We
may issue additional common shares in the future. The issuance of a substantial number of common shares could have the effect of substantially
diluting the interests of our shareholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common shares in the public market, in the
initial issuance, in a situation in which we acquire a company and the acquired company receives common shares as consideration and the
acquired company subsequently sells its common shares, or by investors who acquired such common shares in a private placement, could
have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares. 

Short
sellers may be manipulative and may drive down the market price of our common shares 

Short
selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own, but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third
party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from
a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the
short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. It is therefore in the short seller s interest
for the price of the stock to decline, and some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations
regarding the relevant issuer, often involving misrepresentations of the issuer s business prospects and similar matters calculated
to create negative market momentum, which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short. 

As
a public entity, we may be the subject of concerted efforts by short sellers to spread negative information in order to gain a market
advantage. In addition, the publication of misinformation may also result in lawsuits, the uncertainty and expense of which could adversely
impact our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results. There are no assurances that we will not face short sellers 
efforts or similar tactics in the future, and the market price of our common shares may decline as a result of their actions. 

47 

We
have a significant number of restricted share units, options and warrants outstanding, and while these options and warrants are outstanding,
it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital 

As
of October 28, 2024, we had outstanding restricted share units, options and warrants to purchase 18,428,012 common shares, respectively.
The holders of these restricted share units, options and warrants are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price
of our common shares. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while these options and warrants are outstanding.
At any time during which these securities are likely to be exercised, we may be unable to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable
terms from other sources. Additionally, the exercise of these options and warrants will cause an increase of our outstanding common shares,
which could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current shareholders. 

Sales
of a substantial number of our common shares in the public market by our existing shareholders could cause our share price to fall 

Sales
of a substantial number of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the
market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We
are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common shares. As of October 28, 2024, we
have 18,428,012 shares issuable upon exercise of restricted share units, options and warrants. Sales of shares by these shareholders
could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common shares. We intend to register the offering, issuance, and sale
of all common shares that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in
the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates and the lock-up agreements. 

We
are an Emerging Growth Company, which may reduce the amount of information available to investors 

The
Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act (the JOBS Act ), and our status as a foreign private issuer will allow us to postpone
the date by which we must comply with some of the laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information
we provide in our reports filed with the SEC, which could undermine investor confidence in our company and adversely affect the market
price of our Common shares. 

For
as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions
from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies including: 

the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
 Act requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal
 control over financial reporting; 

any rules that may be adopted
 by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report
 on the financial statements. 

We
intend to take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering in the
United States, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be
a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million
as of the prior June 30; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior
three-year period. 

We
cannot predict if investors will find our common shares or listed warrants Warrants less attractive because we may rely
on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares or Warrants less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading
market for our common shares or Warrants, and our common share or Warrant price may be more volatile and may decline. 

We
have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently,
any gains from an investment in our common shares will likely depend on whether the price of our Common shares increases, which may not
occur 

We
have not paid cash dividends on any capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the
development and growth of our business. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment
in our common shares if the price of our common shares increases beyond the price in which you originally acquired the common shares. 

48 

In
the event a market develops for our common shares or Warrants, the market price of our common shares or Warrants may be volatile 

In
the event a market develops for our common shares or Warrants, the market price of our common shares or Warrants may be highly volatile.
Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our common shares or Warrants are beyond our control, such as changes
in financial estimates by industry and securities analysts, conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our
common shares or Warrants. These factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common shares or Warrants, regardless
of our performance. In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility
has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance
of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Common shares. 

Our
executive officers, directors and principal shareholders will maintain the ability to exert significant control over matters submitted
to our shareholders for approval 

Our
executive officers, directors and principal shareholders who owned more than 5 of our outstanding common shares will, in the aggregate,
beneficially own shares representing approximately 21.16 of our share capital. As a result, if these shareholders were to act together,
they would be able to control all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example,
these persons, if they act together, would control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all
or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms
that other shareholders may desire or result in management of our company that our public shareholders disagree with. 

If
we are or become classified as a passive foreign investment company, our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result 

Generally,
for any taxable year, if at least 75 of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50 of the value of our assets is attributable
to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income, including cash, we would be characterized as
a passive foreign investment company PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of these tests, passive
income includes dividends, interest gains from commodities and securities transactions, the excess of gains over losses from the disposition
of assets which produce passive income (including amounts derived by reason of the temporary investment of funds raised in offerings
of our shares) and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the
active conduct of a trade or business. If we are characterized as a PFIC, our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences,
including having gains realized on the sale of our common shares treated as ordinary income, rather than capital gains, the loss of the
preferential rate applicable to dividends received on our common shares by individuals who are U.S. holders, and having interest charges
apply to distributions by us and gains from the sales of our shares. 

Our
status as a PFIC will depend on the nature and composition of our income and the nature, composition and value of our assets. Asset value
is based on which the fair market value of each asset, including goodwill and going concern value (which may be determined by reference
to the market value of our common shares, which may be volatile). Our status will also depend, in part, on when and how we utilize the
cash proceeds from any securities offerings our business. Based upon the value of our assets, including any goodwill, and the nature
and composition of our income and assets, we believe that we will be classified as a PFIC for the taxable year ending July 31, 2024,
and possibly for succeeding years. However, even if we are classified as a PFIC for the year ending July 31, 2024, under an exception
to the PFIC classification rules, we may be able to avoid such classification altogether if we can meet certain conditions set forth
in the exception. Because the determination
of whether we are a PFIC for any taxable year is a factual determination made annually after the end of each taxable year, there can
be no assurance as to our status as a PFIC in any taxable year. 

49 

The
tax consequences that would apply if we are classified as a PFIC would also be different from those described above if a U.S. shareholder
were able to make a valid qualified electing fund QEF election. If we are classified as a PFIC, then we expect to provide
U.S. shareholders with the information necessary for a U.S. shareholder to make a QEF election but there is no assurance that we will
do so. 

If
estimates of revenue, expenses, or capital or liquidity requirements change or are inaccurate, or if cash generated from operations is
insufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements, the Company may arrange additional financings 

BriaCell
expects that its current cash and cash equivalent reserves will be sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for working capital and capital
expenditures for the near future. In the future, the Company may also arrange financings to give it the financial flexibility to pursue
attractive acquisition or investment opportunities that may arise. The Company may pursue additional financing through various means,
including equity investments, issuances of debt, joint venture projects, licensing arrangements or through other means. The Company cannot
be certain that it will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company s ability
to obtain additional financing may be impaired by such factors as the status of capital markets, both generally and specifically in the
pharmaceutical and medical device industries, and by the fact that it is a new enterprise without a proven operating history. If the
amount of capital raised from additional financing activities, together with revenues from operations (if any), is not sufficient to
satisfy the Company s capital needs, it may not be able to develop or advance its products, execute its business and growth plans,
take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer or partner requirements. If any
of these events occur, the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Any
future equity financings undertaken are likely to be dilutive to existing shareholders. Finally, the terms of securities issued in future
capital transactions may include preferences that are more favorable to new investors. 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they
adversely change their recommendations or publish negative reports regarding our business or our shares, our share price and trading
volume could decline 

The
trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about
us, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that
analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding
our shares, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the market value of our securities would likely
decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose
visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price of our common shares and Warrants and our trading volume to
decline. 

Certain
Canadian legislation contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 

Canadian
legislation could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control and limit the price that certain investors
may be willing to pay for our subordinate voting shares. For instance, a non-Canadian must file an application for review with the Minister
responsible for the Investment Canada Act and obtain approval of the Minister prior to acquiring control of a Canadian business 
within the meaning of the Investment Canada Act, where prescribed financial thresholds are exceeded. Furthermore, limitations on the
ability to acquire and hold our subordinate voting shares and multiple voting shares may be imposed by the Competition Act (Canada).
This legislation permits the Commissioner of Competition to review any acquisition or establishment, directly or indirectly, including
through the acquisition of shares, of control over or of a significant interest in us. Otherwise, there are no limitations either under
the laws of Canada or British Columbia, or in our articles on the rights of non-Canadians to hold or vote our subordinate voting shares
and multiple voting shares. Any of these provisions may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that
may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders. 

50 

Because
we are a corporation incorporated in British Columbia and some of our directors and officers are resident in Canada or other countries,
it may be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce civil liabilities against us based solely upon the federal securities
laws of the United States. Similarly, it may be difficult for Canadian investors to enforce civil liabilities against our directors and
officers residing outside of Canada 

We
are a corporation incorporated under the laws of British Columbia with our registered office in West Vancouver. Some of our
directors and officers and the auditors or other experts named herein are residents of Canada and all or a substantial portion of our
assets and those of such persons are located outside the United States. Consequently, it may be difficult for U.S. investors to effect
service of process within the United States upon us or our directors or officers or such auditors who are not residents of the United
States, or to realize in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon civil liabilities under the
Securities Act. Investors should not assume that Canadian courts: (1) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against
us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or the securities or blue sky laws
of any state within the United States, or (2) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us or such persons predicated upon
the U.S. federal securities laws or any such state securities or blue sky laws. 

Similarly,
some of our directors and officers are residents of countries other than Canada and all or a substantial portion of the assets of such
persons are located outside Canada. As a result, it may be difficult for Canadian investors to initiate a lawsuit within Canada against
these non-Canadian residents. In addition, it may not be possible for Canadian investors to collect from these non-Canadian residents
judgments obtained in courts in Canada predicated on the civil liability provisions of securities legislation of certain of the provinces
and territories of Canada. It may also be difficult for Canadian investors to succeed in a lawsuit in the United States, based solely
on violations of Canadian securities laws.

1C. CYBERSECURITY 

Cybersecurity
Risk Management and Strategy 

The
Company depends on the proper functioning, availability and security of its information systems, including financial, data processing,
communications and operating systems. Several information systems are software applications provided by third parties. Although risks
from cybersecurity threats have to date not materially affected, and we do not believe they are reasonably likely to materially affect,
us, our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, like other companies in our industry, we could, from time to
time, experience threats and security incidents related to our and our third-party vendors information systems, including attempts
to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data, and other electronic security breaches. Such cybersecurity attacks can range from
individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. While we
employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing
a cybersecurity attack. A cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants and vendors. A
successful cybersecurity attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations. 

Assessment,
identification and management of cybersecurity related risks are integrated into our overall risk management process. To the extent our
processes identify a heightened cybersecurity related risk, risk owners are assigned to develop risk mitigation plans, which are then
tracked to completion. 

51 

Cybersecurity
Governance 

Our
Board of Directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated oversight of cybersecurity risk
strategy and governance and of other information technology risks to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit
Committee ). The Audit Committee reports to the full Board of Directors regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity.
Senior management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for assessing and
managing cybersecurity risk, and providing briefings regarding the assessment and management of such risk to the Audit Committee, which
then reports, as necessary, to the Board of Directors. Although members of our senior management do not have direct cybersecurity expertise
obtained through certifications, their experience managing the Company, which includes consulting and coordinating as necessary with
a third party information technology expert referred to below, enables them to effectively assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity
threats. 

The
Company retained an information technology expert third party company to assist in managing relevant risks. In particular, the Company
outsources its information technology function and monitoring to a third party provider whereby it benefits from a professionally managed
network monitoring, management, maintenance, detection and response system and a 24/7 security operations center with both onsite and
remote support services. Any cybersecurity incident would be reported to the Company promptly by our third party consultant and material
and potentially material incidents would be assessed by management and the Audit Committee for remediation and future prevention and
detection. 

The
Company, at least annually, updates its policies or procedures that could help mitigate cybersecurity risks. Notwithstanding the extensive
approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material
adverse effect on us. The Company has incorporated cybersecurity coverage in its insurance policies; however, there is no assurance that
the insurance the Company maintains will cover all cybersecurity breaches or that policy limits will be sufficient to cover all related
losses.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes
included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements
based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could
differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set
forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the financial
statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we review our
estimates and assumptions. The estimates were based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates or other forward-looking statements under
different assumptions or conditions, but we do not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results
of operations. Our actual results may differ materially as a result of many factors, including those set forth under the headings
entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors . 

Overview 

BriaCell
is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that is developing novel immunotherapies to transform cancer care. Immunotherapies have come
to the forefront in the fight against cancer as they harness the body s own immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.
The Company is currently advancing its Bria-IMT targeted immunotherapy in combination with an immune check point inhibitor (Retifanlimab)
in a pivotal Phase 3 study in metastatic breast cancer. Bria-IMT is currently under Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration(the FDA intended to accelerate the review process of novel treatments that address unmet medical needs.
Positive completion of the pivotal study, following review by FDA, could lead to full approval of the Bria-IMT immune checkpoint
inhibitor combination in metastatic breast cancer. BriaCell reported benchmark-beating patient survival and clinical benefit in metastatic
breast cancer with median overall survival of 13.4 months in BriaCell s metastatic breast cancer patients vs. 6.7-9.8 months for
similar patients reported in the literature in its Phase 2 study of Bria-IMT combination study with retifanlimab at the 2023 San
Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. A completed Bria-IMT Phase 1 combination study with retifanlimab (an anti-PD1 antibody manufactured
by Incyte) confirmed tolerability and early-stage efficacy. BriaCell is also developing personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapies, Bria-OTS 
and Bria-OTS+ , which provides a platform technology to develop personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapies for numerous types of
cancer, and a soluble CD80 protein therapeutic which acts both as a stimulator of the immune system as well as an immune checkpoint inhibitor. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

1.
Critical Estimates and Judgements 

The
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of expenses
during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates. The financial statements include estimates which, by
their nature, are uncertain. The impacts of such estimates are pervasive throughout the financial statements, and may require
accounting adjustments based on future occurrences. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the
estimate is revised and also in future periods when the revision affects both current and future periods. 

53 

The
critical judgments and significant estimates in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized
in the consolidated financial statements are: 

Going
Concern 

Preparation
of the consolidated financial statement on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and payments of liabilities
in the ordinary course of business. Should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, it may be unable to realize the carrying
value of its assets, including its intangible assets and to meet its liabilities as they become due. 

Warrants
and options 

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options at the grant date, and the warrant liability
at the grant date and each reporting period date. The key assumptions used in the model are the expected future volatility in the price
of the Company s shares and the expected life of the warrants. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 740, Income Taxes FASB ASC 740 ),
on a tax jurisdictional basis. The Company files income tax returns in the United States. 

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and the consolidated financial statements reported amounts using enacted tax rates and laws in effect in the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is determined
to be more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

Provision
for Income Taxes. Management accounts for income taxes by estimating future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax and
book basis of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws. The application of income tax law is inherently
complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, management is required to make many subjective
assumptions and judgments regarding the Corporation s income tax exposures, including judgments in determining the amount and timing
of recognition of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities, including projections of future taxable income. Interpretations
of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As such, changes in management s subjective assumptions
and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the Consolidated balance sheet and Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss 

Intangible
assets 

Intangible
assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment. The carrying value of intangibles
with definite lives is reviewed each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If there are indications
of impairment, the impairment analysis is completed and if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset
is impaired and impairment loss is recognized. 

Prepaid
expenses 

The
Company has prepaid certain expenses in respect of its pivotal phase III trial and estimates the period over which such expenses will
be incurred. As of July 31, 2024, the Company revised its estimate of the time to completion in respect of this trial. Amounts estimated
to be expenses in more than 12 months have been classified to long-term prepaid expenses. 

The
useful life of property and equipment 

Property
and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the
assets will be used which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in significant variations
in the amounts charged to the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in specific periods. 

Investment
equity method 

Investments
in entities over which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence are accounted for using
the equity method, with the Company s share of losses reported in the loss from equity method investments on the statements of
operation and comprehensive loss. The Company has a 51.2 interest in BC Therapeutics. Management evaluates whether it has control over
the investee in accordance with the guidance of ASC 810, which requires judgment to assess factors such as power over significant activities
of the investee, exposure to variable returns, and the ability to affect those returns. Based on this evaluation, management determines
whether control or significant influence is present for accounting purposes.

Research
Costs 

Research
costs are comprised primarily of (i) salaries and wages to Company employees at our laboratory; and (ii) clinical trials and investigational
drug costs, which include the testing and manufacture of our investigational drugs and costs of our clinical trials. 

The
following is a breakdown of our research and development costs by project: 

Year ended July 31, 

2024

 Other 
 1,931,646 
 1,903,918 

27,177,807 
 15,336,638 

Our
clinical trial expenses include our immunotherapy program, Bria-IMT , a 46-subject Phase 1/2a clinical trial. Clinical trial
expenses increased in 2024 as we recruited more patients into the Bria-IMT trial and began setting up the Bria-OTS trial.
Clinical trial expenses increased in 2024 as patients stayed in the trial for a longer period of time (i.e. a longer than expected overall
survival). Additionally, our costs increased significantly compared with the same period in 2023 for much higher set up costs for the
pivotal Phase 3 study of Bria-IMT combination regimen with Retifanlimab in advanced breast cancer, and additional expenses in
preparation for the upcoming clinical studies of Bria-OTS . 

Our
clinical trial expenses are broken down as follows: 

Year ended July 31, 

2024 
 2023 
 
 Bria-IMT Pivotal Phase 3 study 
 10,518,593 
 2,801,978

 Indirect research and development expenses allocated to trials 
 1,469,253 
 464,325 

15,833,879 
 7,843,760 

During
the year ended July 31, 2024 we pivoted from our Bria-IMT Phase 1/2a study to the Bria-IMT Pivotal Phase 3 Study. 

Pre-clinical
projects include expenses incurred in our off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapies, including Bria-OTS+ , and Bria-PROS .
Our pre-clinical costs have increased in 2024 as we hired more staff to accelerate our existing pre-clinical program and added an additional
pre-clinical program (sCD80). Towards the end of 2024 the financial year end, we have slowed these programs in order to direct more attention
and resources to our clinical trials. 

CMC
costs include the manufacturing of Bria-IMT and Bria-OTS and all quality control and quality assurance testing on the investigational
product. CMC costs decreased in 2024; this reduction can be attributed to efficiencies gained in the manufacturing process and
a streamlined approach to quality control. 

Other
costs are ancillary expenses we incur such as costs to maintain our patents, investigation of early-stage projects, scientific advisory
board expenses, contracts with vendors for pre-clinical work, and administration costs associated with all our research and development
expenditure. Other costs increased in 2024 as we investigated additional potential pre-clinical projects. 

The
following is a breakdown of our research and development costs by nature of expenses: 

Year ended July 31, 

2024

 Share-based compensation 
 734,986 
 1,072,592 

27,177,807 
 15,336,638 

For
the year ended July 31, 2024, research costs totaled 27,177,807, compared to 15,336,638 for the same period in 2023. The increase primarily
resulted from the expansion of the Company s Bria-IMT trial and higher clinical trials and investigational drug costs, which
rose from 9,611,630 in 2023 to 20,890,266 in 2024. Wages and salaries increased from 3,878,367 to 4,567,307, reflecting the hiring
of additional employees. Additionally, non-cash share-based compensation expenses decreased from 1,072,592 in 2023 to 734,986 in 2024,
offsetting some of the overall increase in research and development expenses. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

For
the year ended July 31, 2024, general and administrative expenses amounted to 6,152,269 as compared to 7,935,626 for the year ended
July 31, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily stems from lower insurance premiums, professional fees and
share-based compensation expenses. The Company has reduced general and administrative expenses in order to devote more resources to its
clinical program. 

Financial
income (expenses), net 

For
the year ended July 31, 2024, financial income, net amounted to 262,566, compared to 850,340 for the year ended July 31, 2023. Financial
income for 2024 primarily consists of interest income of 288,018, offset by a foreign exchange loss of 25,450. In comparison, for the
year ended July 31, 2023, interest income was 891,213, while foreign exchange losses totaled 40,873. The decrease in financial income
from 2023 to 2024 reflects lower interest income due to reduced cash and cash equivalents available for investment in interest-bearing
funds. 

Loss
for the period 

The
Company reported a loss for the year ended July 31, 2024, of 4,791,466, compared to 20,302,394 for the year ended July 31, 2023. The
loss in 2024 primarily stems from increased operational spending, particularly in research and development. However, the decrease in
the fair value of the warrant liability substantially offset the increase in research and development expenses, leading to a significantly
lower reported loss for the year. In contrast, the larger loss in 2023 is attributed to lower operational costs but a smaller decrease
in the warrant liability, which did not offset expenses to the same extent as in 2024. This highlights the significant role the warrant
liability valuation plays in influencing the Company s overall financial performance. 

55 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of July 31, 2024, the Company has a negative working capital of 3,807,303) (July 31, 2023- 25,147,050) and an accumulated deficit of
 85,443,697 (July 31, 2023 - 80,652,231). 

As
of July 31, 2024, the Company s capital resources consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, comprised mostly of cash on deposit
with banks, investments in money market funds, investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment
grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity
requirements. 

Historically,
the Company has financed its operation through private and public placement of equity securities, as well as debt financing. The Company s
ability to fund its longer-term cash requirements is subject to multiple risks, many of which are beyond its control. The Company intends
to raise additional capital, either through debt or equity financings in order to achieve its business plan objectives. Management believes
that it can be successful in obtaining additional capital; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so.
There is no assurance that any funds raised will be sufficient to enable the Company to attain profitable operations or continue as a
going concern. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful, the Company may need to curtail or cease its operations and implement
a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be
no assurance that such a plan will be successful. To this end, for several months during calendar year 2024, certain directors
and officers agreed to defer payment of their directors fees/compensation until we completed a financing, after which, these
fees were paid in full. Further, certain officers have indicated their willingness to receive a portion of their compensation
in shares of the Company, subject to applicable Nasdaq rules. In addition, we continue to reduce expenditure on certain non-core
activities whilst maintaining our focus on our Phase 3 Bria-IMT pivotal study in advanced metastatic breast cancer. 

During
the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company s overall position of cash and cash equivalents decreased by 20,389,003 from the year
ended July 31, 2023 (including effects of foreign exchange). This decrease in cash can be attributed to the following: 

The
Company s net cash used in operating activities during the year ended July 31, 2024, was 24,126,128 as compared to 23,744,860
for the year ended July 31, 2023. Although the operating loss was higher during the period ended July 31, 2024, this was offset by an
increase in accounts payable, such that the cash flows from operating activities during both periods were similar. 

Cash
generated from financing activities for the year ended July 31, 2024, was 4,418,926, as compared to 3,954,300 for the year ended July
31, 2023. In both periods, this relates to proceeds for the issuance of shares.

of 1934 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal accounting
and financial officer have concluded that as of July 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable
assurance level. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. 

As
of July 31, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

Based
on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of July 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective at
the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended July 31, 2024. No change in our
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter
ended July 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting,
except for our remediation efforts described above.

60 

Family
Relationships and Other Arrangements 

There
are no family relationships among our directors and executive officers. There are no arrangements or understandings between or among
our executive officers and directors pursuant to which any director or executive officer was or is to be selected as a director or executive
officer. 

Composition
of our Board 

Under
our amended articles of incorporation, our Board consists of a minimum of three directors and up to that number which was last set by
ordinary resolution of the shareholders. Our Board is currently comprised of seven directors, and under the Business Corporations Act
(British Columbia) BCBCA ), as a reporting issuer, we must have no fewer than three directors. Under the BCBCA, a director
may be removed with or without cause by a resolution passed by at least two-thirds of the votes cast by shareholders present in person
or by proxy at a meeting and who are entitled to vote. The directors are appointed at the annual general meeting of shareholders and
the term of office for each of the directors will expire at the time of our next annual shareholders meeting. Our amended articles of
incorporation provide that, between annual general meetings of our shareholders, the directors may appoint one or more additional directors,
but the number of additional directors may not at any time exceed one-third of the number of directors who held office at the expiration
of the last meeting of our shareholders. Under the BCBCA, there is no minimum number of directors required to be resident Canadians as
defined in the BCBCA. 

Director
Term Limits and Other Mechanisms of Board Renewal 

Our
Board has not adopted director term limits or other automatic mechanisms of Board renewal. Rather than adopting formal term limits, mandatory
age-related retirement policies and other mechanisms of Board renewal, the nominating and corporate governance committee of our Board
will develop a skills and competencies matrix for our Board as a whole and for individual directors. The nominating and corporate governance
committee conducts a process for the assessment of our board of directors, each committee and each director regarding his or her effectiveness
and contribution, and reports evaluation results to our Board on a regular basis. 

Director
Independence 

Under
the Nasdaq Rules, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company s board of directors. For purposes of the
Nasdaq Rules, an independent director means a person other than an executive officer or employee of the company who, in the opinion of
the board of directors, has no relationship with the company that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying
out the responsibilities of a director. Under NI 58-101, a director is considered to be independent if he or she is independent within
the meaning of Section 1.4 of National Instrument 52-110- Audit Committees . Section 1.4 of NI 52-110 generally provides that a
director is independent if he or she has no direct or indirect relationship with the issuer which could, in the view of the issuer s
board of directors, be reasonably expected to interfere with the exercise of the director s independent judgment. 

Our
Board has undertaken a review of the independence of each director. Based on information provided by each director concerning his or
her background, employment and affiliations, our Board has determined that Dr. Gross, Dr. Taub, Mr. Embro-Pantalony, Mr. Schmieg, and
Mr. Bondarenko, representing five of the seven members of our Board, are independent as that term is defined under the
Nasdaq Rules. In making this determination, our Board considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director
has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the
beneficial ownership of our shares by each non-employee director. Dr. Williams is not independent by virtue of being the Company s
Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Lustig is not independent by virtue of being a significant securityholder of the Company. 

Certain
members of our Board are also members of the boards of other public companies. Our Board has not adopted a director interlock policy,
but is kept informed of other public directorships held by its members. 

61 

Mandate
of the Board of Directors 

Our
Board is responsible for supervising the management of our business and affairs, including providing guidance and strategic oversight
to management. Our Board s mandate includes, among other things, the following matters:

developing
 the corporate goals and objectives that management is responsible for meeting and reviewing the performance of our senior officers
 against such corporate goals and objectives;

 processes; 

reviewing
 and approving management s strategic and business plans and our financial objectives, plans and actions, including significant
 capital allocations and expenditures; and 

reviewing
 and approving material transactions not in the ordinary course of business. 

Meetings
of Independent Directors 

Our
Board holds regularly-scheduled quarterly meetings as well as ad hoc meetings from time to time. The independent members of our
Board also meet, as required, without the non-independent directors and members of management after each regularly scheduled board meeting. 

A
director who has a material interest in a matter before our Board or any committee on which he or she serves is required to disclose
such interest as soon as the director becomes aware of it. In situations where a director has a material interest in a matter to be considered
by our Board or any committee on which he or she serves, such director may be required to absent himself or herself from the meeting
while discussions and voting with respect to the matter are taking place. Directors are also required to comply with the relevant provisions
of the BCBCA regarding conflicts of interest. 

Position
Descriptions 

Our
Board has adopted written terms of reference for the chairman which set out his or her key responsibilities, including duties relating
to determining the frequency, dates and locations of meetings and setting Board meeting agendas, chairing Board and shareholder meetings
and carrying out any other or special assignments or any functions as may be requested by our Board or management, as appropriate. 

Our
Board has also adopted written terms of reference for each of the committee chairs which set out each of the committee chair s
key responsibilities, including duties relating to determining the frequency, dates and locations of meetings and setting committee meeting
agendas, chairing committee meetings, reporting to our Board and carrying out any other special assignments or any functions as may be
requested by our Board. 

In
addition, our Board, in conjunction with our Chief Executive Officer, will develop and implement a written position description for the
role of our Chief Executive Officer. 

62 

Orientation
and Continuing Education 

We
have implemented an orientation program for new directors under which a new director meets separately with the chairman of our Board,
members of the senior executive team and the secretary. 

The
nominating and corporate governance committee will be responsible for coordinating orientation and continuing director development programs
relating to the committee s mandate. The chairman of our Board will be responsible for overseeing director continuing education
designed to maintain or enhance the skills and abilities of our directors and to ensure that their knowledge and understanding of our
business remains current. 

Code
of Conduct 

Our
board of directors has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees. We have made the Code of
Ethics available on our website https://briacell.com/corporate/corporate-governance/. We intend to disclose future amendments to, or
waivers of, our Code of Ethics, as and to the extent required by SEC regulations, at the same location on our website identified above
or in public filings. 

Monitoring
Compliance with the Code of Conduct 

Our
nominating and corporate governance committee will be responsible for reviewing and evaluating the code of conduct at least annually
and will recommend any necessary or appropriate changes to our Board for consideration. The nominating and corporate governance committee
will assist our Board with the monitoring of compliance with the code of conduct, and will be responsible for considering any waivers
therefrom (other than waivers applicable to members of the nominating and corporate governance committee, which shall be considered by
the audit committee, or waivers applicable to our directors or executive officers, which shall be subject to review by our Board as a
whole). 

Requirement
for Directors and Officers to Disclose Interest in a Contract or Transaction 

In
accordance with the BCBCA, each director and officer must disclose the nature and extent of any interest that he or she has in a material
contract or material transaction whether made or proposed with us, if the director or officer is a party to the contract or transaction,
is a director or an officer or an individual acting in a similar capacity of a party to the contract or transaction, or has a material
interest in a party to the contract or transaction. Subject to certain limited exceptions under the BCBCA, no director may vote on a
resolution to approve a material contract or material transaction which is subject to such disclosure requirement. 

As
of the date hereof, except as otherwise disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, to the knowledge of the Board or the management
of the Company, there are no material interests, whether direct or indirect, of any informed person of the Company, any proposed director
of the Company, or any associate or affiliate of any informed person or proposed director, in any transaction since the commencement
of the Company s most recently completed financial year or in any proposed transaction which has materially affected or would materially
affect the Company of any of its subsidiaries. 

Benefits
upon Termination of Employment 

The
service contracts with our directors do not provide for any benefits upon termination of employment, other than a tail 
directors and officers insurance policy. 

Complaint
Reporting 

In
order to foster a climate of openness and honesty in which any concern or complaint pertaining to a suspected violation of the law, our
code of conduct or any of our policies, or any unethical or questionable act or behavior, our code of conduct will require that our employees
promptly report the violation or suspected violation. In order to ensure that violations or suspected violations can be reported without
fear of retaliation, harassment or an adverse employment consequence, we will adopt a whistleblowing policy which will contain procedures
that are aimed to facilitate confidential, anonymous submissions of complaints by our directors, officers, employees and others. 

Committees
of the Board 

We
currently have an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, with each committee
having a written charter. 

63 

Audit
Committee 

Our
Audit Committee is currently comprised of Vaughn C. Embro-Pantalony, Martin Schmieg and Jane A. Gross, and chaired by Mr. Embro-Pantalony.
Our Board has determined that each of Mr. Schmieg and Mr. Embro-Pantalony is financially literate and meets the independence requirements
for directors, including the heightened independence standards for members of the audit committee under Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange

the Nasdaq Rules, financially literate within the meaning of NI 52-110, and a financial expert as defined

compensation committee is comprised of Mr. Embro-Pantalony, Mr. Marc Lustig and Mr. Schmieg and is chaired by Mr. Schmieg. The Compensation Committee
is appointed by the Board to assist in promoting a culture of integrity throughout the Company, to assist the Board in setting director
and senior executive compensation, and to develop and submit to the Board recommendations with respect to other employee benefits as
the Compensation Committee sees fit. In the performance of its duties, the Compensation Committee is guided by the following principles: 

offering
 competitive compensation to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified executives in order for the Company to meet its goals;
 and 

acting
 in the interests of the Company and the shareholders by being fiscally responsible. 

The
Board relies on the knowledge and experience of the members of the Compensation Committee to set appropriate levels of compensation for
senior officers. Neither the Company nor the Compensation Committee currently has, or has had at any time since incorporation, any contractual
arrangement with any executive compensation consultant who has a role in determining or recommending the amount or form of senior officer
compensation. 

65 

When
determining compensation payable, the Compensation Committee considers both external and internal data. External data includes
general market conditions and well as information regarding compensation paid to directors, CEOs and CFOs of companies of similar
size and at a similar stage of development in the industry. Internal data includes annual reviews of the performance of the
directors, CEO and CFO in light of the Company s corporate objectives and considers other factors that may have impacted the
Company s success in achieving its objectives. During the year ended July 31, 2024, the Compensation Committee held two
meetings in person or through conference calls. 

Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee 

The
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is appointed by the Board to assist in fulfilling its corporate governance responsibilities
under applicable laws. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, developing the Company s
approach to governance issues and establishing sound corporate governance practices that are in the interests of shareholders and that
contribute to effective and efficient decision-making. 

Our
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is currently comprised of Mr. Marc Lustig and Dr. Taub and is chaired by Mr. Lustig. During
the year ended July 31, 2024, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held one meeting. 

Exculpation,
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Officers 

Under
the BCBCA, a company may indemnify: (i) a current or former director or officer of that company; (ii) a current or former director or
officer of another corporation if, at the time such individual held such office, the corporation was an affiliate of the company, or
if such individual held such office at the company s request; or (iii) an individual who, at the request of the company, held,
or holds, an equivalent position in another entity (an indemnifiable person against all costs, charges and expenses, including
an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment, reasonably incurred by him or her in respect of any civil, criminal, administrative
or other legal proceeding or investigative action (whether current, threatened, pending or completed) in which he or she is involved
because of that person s position as an indemnifiable person, unless: (i) the individual did not act honestly and in good faith
with a view to the best interests of such company or the other entity, as the case may be; or (ii) in the case of a proceeding other
than a civil proceeding, the individual did not have reasonable grounds for believing that the individual s conduct was lawful.
A company cannot indemnify an indemnifiable person if it is prohibited from doing so under its articles or by applicable law. A company
may pay, as they are incurred in advance of the final disposition of an eligible proceeding, the expenses actually and reasonably incurred
by an indemnifiable person in respect of that proceeding only if the indemnifiable person has provided an undertaking that, if it is
ultimately determined that the payment of expenses was prohibited, the indemnifiable person will repay any amounts advanced. Subject
to the aforementioned prohibitions on indemnification, a company must, after the final disposition of an eligible proceeding, pay the
expenses actually and reasonably incurred by an indemnifiable person in respect of such eligible proceeding if such indemnifiable person
has not been reimbursed for such expenses, and was wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the outcome of such eligible proceeding
or was substantially successful on the merits in the outcome of such eligible proceeding. On application from an indemnifiable person,
a court may make any order the court considers appropriate in respect of an eligible proceeding, including the indemnification of penalties
imposed or expenses incurred in any such proceedings and the enforcement of an indemnification agreement. As permitted by the BCBCA,
under Article 21.1, we are required to indemnify our directors and former directors (and such individual s respective heirs and
legal representatives) and we will indemnify any such person to the extent permitted by the BCBCA . 

The
BCBCA provides certain protections under Part 5 - Management, Division 5 - Indemnification of Directors and Officers and Payment
of Expenses, to our current and former directors and officers, as well as other eligible parties defined in Section 159 of the BCBCA
(the Eligible Parties , each an Eligible Party ). The Company will indemnify the Eligible Parties, to the fullest
extent permitted by law and subject to certain limitations listed in Section 163 of the BCBCA, against any proceeding in which an Eligible
Party or any of the heirs and personal or other legal representatives of the Eligible Party, by reason of the Eligible Party being or
having been a director or officer of, or holding or having held a position equivalent to that of a director or officer of, the Company
or an associated corporation (a) is or may be joined as a party, or (b) is or may be liable for or in respect of a judgment, penalty
or fine in, or expenses related tom, the proceeding. 

66 

We
maintain insurance policies relating to certain liabilities that our directors and officers may incur in such capacity.

 Based
solely on a Schedule 13G filed with the SEC on September 16, 2024. The Schedule 13G was filed by CVI Investments, Inc. and
Heights Capital Management, Inc. According to the Schedule 13G, as of September 16, 2024, CVI Investments, Inc. and Heights Capital
Management, Inc. have shared voting power and shared dispositive power with regard to 2,608,695 common shares, representing approximately
7.28 of the outstanding common shares. 

Section
16(A) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10 of a registered class of our equity
securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10 shareholders
are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 

Based
on a review of the copies of such forms received, we believe that during the fiscal year ending July 31, 2024, all filing requirements
applicable to our officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners were complied with, except for one late Form 4 filing for
Marc Lustig with respect to his purchase of common shares and warrants in our May 2024 offering.

the last two completed fiscal years, and in which any of our directors, executive officers or, to our knowledge, beneficial owners of
more than 5 of our capital stock or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or
indirect material interest, other than equity and other compensation, termination, change in control and other arrangements, which are
described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other than as set forth below, we are not a party to a current related party
transaction, and no transaction is currently proposed, in which the amount of the transaction exceeds the lesser of 120,000 or 1 of
the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which a related person had or will have a
direct or indirect material interest. 

On
May 17, 2024 we issued and sold to a director 902,935 common shares together with warrants to purchase up to 902,935 common shares at
a combined purchase price of 2.215 per share and accompanying warrant. The warrants will be exercisable six months from the date of
issuance at an exercise price of 2.11 per share and will expire on the five year anniversary of the initial exercise date. 

Director
Independence 

Our
board of directors undertook a review of the independence of our directors and considered whether any director has a relationship with
us that could compromise that director s ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out that director s responsibilities.
Our board of directors has affirmatively determined that Dr. Gross, Dr. Taub. Mr. Bondarenko, Mr. Empro-Pantalony, Mr. Lustig, and Mr.
Schmieg are each an independent director, as defined under the Nasdaq rules.

F- 1 

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of BriaCell Therapeutics Corp. 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BriaCell Therapeutics Corp. (the Company) as at July 31, 2024 and 2023,
and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders equity (deficit), and cash
flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated
financial statements). 

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position at the
Company as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its consolidated operations and its consolidated cash flows for each of the
years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

Material
Uncertainty Related to Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has an
accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in
regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

 For
the Years Ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 

 (Expressed
in US Dollars, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated) 

(July
 31, 2023 - and negative cash flows from operating activities during the year ended July 31, 2024 was 
 (July 31, 2023 - ).
 The Company is planning to finance its operations by exploring additional sources of capital and financing, while
managing its existing working capital resources. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its
 ability to attain future profitable operations and to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations arising from normal
 business operations when they come due. The uncertainty of the Company s ability to raise such financial capital casts
 substantial doubt on the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not
 include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not
 be able to continue as a going concern. See note 15(c,d) for details of an 
 million and million offering that was completed in September 2024 and October 2024, respectively. 

d. 
 The
 Company has two wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries: (i) BriaCell Therapeutics Corp. BTC ),
 which was incorporated in April 3, 2014, under the laws of the state of Delaware, and (ii)
 BTC has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Sapientia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Sapientia ),
 which was incorporated in September 20, 2012, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The
 Company also has one Canadian subsidiary: BriaPro Therapeutics Corp, BriaPro which was incorporated on May 15, 2023, under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).
 See also note 1e. (Sapientia and BTC and BriaPro together, the Subsidiaries 
 
 The
 Company has one operating segment and reporting unit. 

e. 
 On
 August 31, 2023, the Company closed a plan of arrangement spinout transaction (the Arrangement pursuant to which certain
 pipeline assets of the Company, including Bria-TILsRx and protein kinase C delta (PKC inhibitors for multiple indications
 including cancer (the BriaPro Assets ), were spun-out to BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. BriaPro ), resulting
 in a 2/3rd owned subsidiary of the Company with the remaining 1/3rd held by BriaCell shareholders BriaCell Shareholders ). 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Arrangement, BriaPro has acquired the entire right and interest in and to the BriaPro Assets in consideration for
the issuance by BriaPro to the Company of BriaPro common shares. Under the terms of the Arrangement, for each BriaCell share held immediately
prior to closing, BriaCell Shareholders receive one (1) common share of BriaPro, and one (1) new common share of BriaCell (retiring their
old share) having the same terms and characteristics as the existing BriaCell common shares. The Company will remain listed on the NASDAQ
Stock Market and Toronto Stock Exchange, and BriaPro is an unlisted reporting issuer in Canada. 

Immediately
following the closing of the Arrangement, the Company controls 2/3rd of the BriaPro common shares representing approximately of
the issued and outstanding common shares of BriaPro. 

As
a result of the Arrangement, there are BriaPro common shares issued and outstanding. The Company now beneficially owns or
controls approximately BriaPro common shares, representing 2/3rd of the issued and outstanding BriaPro common shares. 

Pursuant
to the Arrangement, each BriaCell warrant in issuance at the time of the Arrangement shall, in accordance with its terms, entitle
the holder thereof to receive, upon the exercise thereof, one BriaCell Share and one BriaPro Share for the original exercise
price. Warrants issued by the Company, subsequent to the Arrangement are not subject to the terms above. 

Upon

POLICY 

 EFFECTIVE
DECEMBER 1, 2023 

1. 
 Purpose .
 The purpose of this Briacell Therapeutics, Corp. (the Company Clawback Policy (this Policy is to enable the Company to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation from Covered Executive Officers in the event that the Company
 is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement. This Policy is designed to comply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent
 with, Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as codified in Section 10D of the Securities
 Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act Rule
 10D-1 and Listing Rule 5608 of the corporate governance rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq (the Listing Standards ). Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, capitalized terms shall have the meaning ascribed
 to such terms in Section 2 . 

2. 
 Definitions .
 As used in this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below. 

a. 
 Accounting
 Restatement means an accounting restatement of the Company s financial statements due to the Company s material
 noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to
 correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (i.e.,
 a Big R restatement), or to correct an error that is not material to the previously issued financial statements, but
 that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current
 period (i.e., a little r restatement). 

b. 
 Accounting
 Restatement Date means the earlier to occur of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers
 of the Company authorized to take such action if the Board s action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded,
 that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement and (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized
 body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 

c. 
 Applicable
 Period means, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Accounting
 Restatement Date, as well as any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately
 following those three completed fiscal years (except that a transition period that comprises a period of at least nine months shall
 count as a completed fiscal year). 

d. 
 Board 
 means the board of directors of the Company. 

e. 
 Code 
 means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Any reference to a section of the Code or regulation thereunder includes
 such section or regulation, any valid regulation or other official guidance promulgated under such section, and any comparable provision
 of any future legislation or regulation amending, supplementing, or superseding such section or regulation. 

f. 
 Covered
 Executive Officer means an individual who is currently or previously served as the Company s principal executive
 officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or, if there is no such accounting officer, the controller),
 vice president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance),
 an officer who performs (or performed) a policy-making function, or any other person who performs (or performed) similar policy-making
 functions for the Company or is otherwise determined to be an executive officer of the Company pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation
 S-K. An executive officer of the Company s parent or subsidiary is deemed a Covered Executive Officer if the
 executive officer performs (or performed) such policy- making functions for the Company. 

g. 
 Erroneously
 Awarded Compensation means, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation previously
 received that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based
 on the restated amounts in such Accounting Restatement, and must be computed without regard to any taxes paid by the relevant Covered
 Executive Officer; provided, however, that for Incentive-Based Compensation based on share price or total shareholder return, where
 the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting
 Restatement: (i) the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting
 Restatement on the share price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received and (ii) the
 Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq. 

h. 
 Financial
 Reporting Measure means any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used
 in preparing the Company s financial statements and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure. A Financial
 Reporting Measure is not required to be presented within the Company s financial statements or included in a filing with the
 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to qualify as a Financial Reporting Measure. 

i. 
 Incentive-Based
 Compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of
 a Financial Reporting Measure. Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received for purposes of this Policy in the Company s
 fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even
 if the payment or grant of such Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. 

3. 
 Administration .
 This Policy shall be administered by the Board, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee ),
 the Audit Committee of the Board (the Audit Committee or a special committee comprised of members of the Compensation
 Committee and Audit Committee. For purposes of this Policy, the body charged with administering this Policy shall be referred to
 herein as the Administrator . The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make
 all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy, in each case, to the extent permitted
 under the Listing Standards and in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code.
 All determinations and decisions made by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of this Policy shall be final, conclusive and
 binding on all persons, including the Company, its affiliates, its shareholders and Covered Executive Officers, and need not be uniform
 with respect to each person covered by this Policy. 

In
the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committees
of the Board as may be necessary or appropriate as to matters within the scope of such other committee s responsibility and authority.
Subject to any limitation at applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take
any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery
under this Policy involving such officer or employee). Any action or inaction by the Administrator with respect to a Covered Executive
Officer under this Policy in no way limits the Administrator s decision to act or not to act with respect to any other Covered
Executive Officer under this Policy or under any similar policy, agreement or arrangement, nor shall any such action or inaction serve
as a waiver of any rights the Company may have against any Covered Executive Officer other than as set forth in this Policy. 

4. 
 Application
 of this Policy . This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation received by a person: (a) after beginning service as
 a Covered Executive Officer; (b) who served as a Covered Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based
 Compensation; (c) while the Company had a listed class of securities on a national securities exchange; and (d) during the Applicable
 Period. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to both a Financial Reporting Measure vesting condition
 and a service-based vesting condition shall be considered received when the relevant Financial Reporting Measure is achieved, even
 if the Incentive-Based Compensation continues to be subject to the service-based vesting condition. 

5. 
 Recovery
 Erroneously Awarded Compensation . In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company must recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation
 reasonably promptly, in amounts determined pursuant to this Policy. The Company s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded
 Compensation is not dependent on the filing of restated financial statements. Recovery under this Policy with respect to a Covered
 Executive Officer shall not require the finding of any misconduct by such Covered Executive Officer or such Covered Executive Officer
 being found responsible for the accounting error leading to an Accounting Restatement. In the event of an Accounting Restatement,
 the method for recouping Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be determined by the Administrator in its sole and absolute discretion,
 to the extent permitted under the Listing Standards and in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of)
 Section 409A of the Code. 

Recovery
may include, without limitation, (i) reimbursement of all or a portion of any incentive compensation award, (ii) cancellation of incentive
compensation awards and (iii) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. 

The
Company is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy
unless the Compensation Committee has determined that recovery would be impracticable solely for the following limited reasons, and subject
to the following procedural and disclosure requirements: 

a. 
 The
 direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before reaching
 such conclusion, the Administrator must make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such
 reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to Nasdaq; 

b. 
 Recovery
 would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before reaching such conclusion, the Administrator
 must obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide
 such opinion to Nasdaq; or 

c. 
 Recovery
 would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company,
 to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Code. 

6. 
 Prohibition
 on Indemnification and Insurance Reimbursement . The Company is prohibited from indemnifying any Covered Executive Officer against
 the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation. Further, the Company is prohibited from paying or reimbursing a Covered Executive
 Officer for the cost of purchasing insurance to cover any such loss. The Company is also prohibited from entering into any agreement
 or arrangement whereby this Policy would not apply or fail to be enforced against a Covered Executive Officer. 

7. 
 Required
 Policy-Related Disclosure and Filings . The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with
 the requirements of the federal securities laws, including disclosures required by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
 A copy of this Policy and any amendments hereto shall be posted on the Company s website and filed as an exhibit to the Company s
 annual report on Form 10-K. 

8. 
 Acknowledgement .
 Each Covered Executive Officer shall sign and return to the Company within thirty (30) calendar days following the later of (i) the
 effective date of this Policy set forth below or (ii) the date such individual becomes a Covered Executive Officer, the Acknowledgement
 Form attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which the Covered Executive Officer agrees to be bound by, and to comply with, the
 terms and conditions of this Policy. 

9. 
 Amendment ;
 Termination. The Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion and shall amend this Policy as
 it deems necessary to reflect the Listing Standards or to comply with (or maintain an exemption from the application of) Section
 409A of the Code. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time; provided , that the termination of this Policy would not
 cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, or rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or
 the Listing Standards. 

10. 
 Other
 Recovery Obligations; General Rights . The Board intends that this Policy shall be applied to the fullest extent of the law. To
 the extent that the application of this Policy would provide for recovery of Incentive- Based Compensation that the Company already
 recovered pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other recovery obligations, any such amount recovered from a Covered
 Executive Officer will be credited to any recovery required under this Policy in respect of such Covered Executive Officer. 

11. 
 Effective
 Date . This Policy shall be effective as of December 1, 2023. The terms of this Policy shall apply to any Incentive- Based Compensation
 that is received by Covered Executive Officers on or after October 2, 2023, even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved,
 awarded or granted to Covered Executive Officers prior to such date. 

This
Policy shall not limit the rights of the Company to take any other actions or pursue other remedies that the Company may deem appropriate
under the circumstances and under applicable law, in each case, to the extent permitted under the Listing Standards and in compliance
with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code. 

This
Policy is binding and enforceable against all Covered Executive Officers and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or
other legal representatives.
