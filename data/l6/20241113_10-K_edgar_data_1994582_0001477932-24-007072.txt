Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. RESULTS OF OPERATION As of August 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 24,588. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. Year Ended August 31, 2024 compared to the period from Inception (July 10, 2023) to August 31, 2023 Revenue During the year ended August 31, 2024, the Company had 46,959 in revenue, compared to 0 during the period from inception (July 10, 2023) to August 31, 2023. For the year ended August 31, 2024, the Company had in 39,939 in cost of goods sold and 7,020 in gross profit. 4 | Page Table of Contents Operating Expenses During the year ended August 31, 2024, we incurred total operating expenses of 30,620 compared to 988 during the period from inception (July 10, 2023) to August 31, 2023. General and administrative and professional fee expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting and developmental costs. Net Loss Our net loss for the year ended August 31, 2024 was 23,600 compared to 988 during the period from inception (July 10, 2023) to August 31, 2023. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As at August 31, 2024 our total assets were 90,850 compared to 4,000 in total assets at August 31, 2023. As at August 31, 2024, our total liabilities were 36,408 compared to 988 as of August 31, 2023. Stockholders equity was 54,442 as of August 31, 2024 compared to 3,012 as of August 31, 2023.

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 5 | Page Table of Contents MATERIAL COMMITMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Oyocar Group, Inc. (the "Company") as of August 31, 2024, and 2023, the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows, for the year then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended August 31, 2024, and 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern as disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statement, the Company has accumulated deficit of 24,588, the Company currently has limited revenue. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon improving profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide additional cash to meet the Company s obligations as they become due. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. Communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. As of August 31, 2024, there are no critical audit matters to communicate. /s/ BOLADALE LAWAL CO. (Chartered Accountants) PCAOB ID ) We have served as the Company's auditor since May 2024.

F-5 | Page Table of Contents OYOCAR GROUP INC. NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2024 . These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission of 2013 (COSO).
