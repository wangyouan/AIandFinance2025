PART I 
 ITEM 1. B USINESS 
 Our Company 
 Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. is a leading international specialty retailer and distributor of professional beauty supplies. As experts in hair color and care, we aim to empower our customers to express themselves through their hair and beyond. We operate two business segments that offer beauty products in key categories, including hair care, hair color, styling tools and nails. 
 Sally Beauty Supply SBS An omni-channel retailer that offers professional-quality beauty supplies at attractive prices and provides education to retail consumers and salon professionals throughout North America, South America and Europe. SBS operates primarily through retail stores (generally operating under the Sally Beauty banner) and digital platforms, including our www.sallybeauty.com website and a mobile commerce-based app. 
 Beauty Systems Group BSG A leading full-service omni-channel distributor that offers professional beauty supplies exclusively to salons and salon professionals throughout the U.S. and Canada. These salon professionals primarily rely on just-in-time inventory due to capital constraints and limited warehouse and shelf space. BSG operates through company-operated stores (generally operating under the Cosmo Prof banner), franchised stores, distributor sales consultants DSCs and digital platforms, including our www.cosmoprofbeauty.com website, a mobile commerce-based app and chain portals. 
 The breadth, depth and professional quality of our hair color and care assortment provides us with a differentiated core business in an industry which is otherwise fragmented. Due to our long history, brand heritage, product and process-specific knowledge and training of associates, we provide unmatched hair color and care expertise to consumers. We also have strong positioning with suppliers given our focus and economies of scale of purchasing. By operating in a variety of channels, we are able to reach broad, diversified geographies and customer segments using a variety of product assortments and tactics. 
 Operating and Growth Strategy 
 Our operating and growth strategy is guided by our vision to own professional hair color and care for both the do-it-yourself DIY enthusiast and the professional stylist. SBS s differentiation is to offer a vast array of hair color and care solutions for in-home use, supported by the content and education we provide our customers. At BSG, we are the largest North American distributor of professional hair color and care, offering stylists and salons the most extensive portfolio of third-party brands in the market. 
 We remain focused on driving top line growth and profitability by executing on our strategic initiatives: 
 Customer Centricity 
 Our DIY customers and professional stylists value the services, education and innovation we provide. We continue to build customer centricity through our value-added services and concepts, including Licensed Colorist on Demand LCOD ), Happy Beauty Co. and digital marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart.com, DoorDash, and Instacart. Looking ahead, we plan on using technology to expand our role in the stylists ecosystem to create value for stylists and our brands. As we gain insights and customer feedback from these concepts, we believe there are opportunities for us to expand on these concepts further and to provide growth beyond our core. 
 Owned Brands and Innovation 
 We believe our focus on growing our owned brands at SBS and innovating will help us attract new customers and keep long-term relationships with existing customers. During the fiscal year, we continued to expand our owned brand portfolio and brought to market many innovative products from new and key vendors. At BSG, we further expanded our distribution with brands like Amika, Color Wow, and Moroccanoil and we continue to test new brands. Additionally, at the end of the fiscal year, we expanded our distribution rights and significantly strengthened BSG s position in a strategically important market with the acquisition of Exclusive Beauty. Going into next fiscal year, we are focused on expanding our owned brand offerings to drive higher sales penetration in Sally, increasing our BSG distribution footprint through expanding high-profile brands, and bringing to market innovation across our key categories of hair care and hair color. 
 - 1 - 

Efficiency and Optimization 
 During the fiscal year, we were able to continue our Fuel for Growth FFG initiative that was initially launched in fiscal year 2023. FFG is a mandate to rethink the way we work, generating cost savings and modernizing key parts of our business. For example, our transition to pooled distribution and ongoing changes to our store shipping frequency have lowered our transportation costs. During fiscal 2024, we transitioned select information technology functions to a best cost location, which allowed for the consolidation of our vendor base, lower costs, and the creation of organizational efficiencies. 
 We believe focusing in these areas will position our company for future growth, further enhance our ability to meet our customers where they are and help us attract new customers. 
 Store Design and Locations 
 	Sally Beauty Supply 
 SBS has retail stores in the U.S. (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Chile. Stores are designed to highlight our extensive product offerings and differentiated position in hair color, hair care, styling tools and nails. We apply strong category management processes, including store specific planograms, to maintain consistent merchandise presentation across our store base. In the U.S. and Canada, our average store offers an average of 7,000 beauty products and is approximately 1,700 square feet in size. Stores are typically located in strip shopping centers, which are occupied by other high-traffic retailers such as grocery stores, mass merchants and home improvement centers. Store formats, including average size and product selection, vary by marketplace to meet the needs of the local customer. 
 We calibrate store renewals, remodels and expansions between new and existing geographies. In existing marketplaces, we add stores to provide additional coverage and strategically close or relocate underperforming stores as necessary. In new marketplaces, SBS selects geographic areas and store sites on the basis of demographic information, the quality and nature of neighboring tenants, store visibility and location accessibility. SBS generally seeks to expand in geographically contiguous areas to leverage its expertise and brand recognition. 
 During the fiscal year, we continued testing our new Happy Beauty Co. store concept. Happy Beauty Co. is a unique new retail store concept that brings to market an engaging beauty experience with thousands of quality products priced under 10 in an accessible, fun and expressive environment. Stores feature both third-party brands and our owned brands encompassing four key categories: cosmetics and facial care, bath and body, nails, and hair. The initial pilot stores were opened in the Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas and Phoenix, Arizona markets. We currently anticipate opening a small number of additional pilot stores within the same markets during fiscal year 2025. 
 Additionally, we have made the decision to move away from services in our Studio by Sally store concept given the solid traction we are seeing with our LCOD online consultation services. We are taking the knowledge from the Studio by Sally stores and applying the learnings to the rest of the SBS fleet, including piloting a store refresh that reflects modernized branding, an expanded assortment, as well as new floor plans and fixtures. 
 SBS s store count for the last three fiscal years is summarized in the following table:

 	Beauty Systems Group 
 BSG stores, including franchise-based Armstrong McCall stores, are designed to highlight our extensive product offerings to salons and salon professionals. Our stores, on average, offer approximately 8,000 professional beauty products tailored to the territory and are segmented into distinctive areas arranged by product type, with certain areas

dedicated to leading third-party brands. Our company-operated stores average approximately 2,700 square feet and are located primarily in secondary strip shopping centers, and are a destination exclusively for licensed cosmetologists.

 Merchandise 
 We believe our product offerings, led by our hair color and care categories, provide us a competitive advantage. During the last three fiscal years, our hair color and care products made up approximately 70 of our total consolidated sales. Key products included within our sales categories are as follows: 
 Hair Color Developer/lightener, semi-permanent/demi-permanent/permanent hair color, toner 

Hair Care Shampoo and conditioner, hair gels, creams, oils, and other styling products 

Styling Tools Hair dryers, irons, curling rods/rollers/pins, brushes/combs, clippers/trimmers/accessories, shears, razors, salon accessories, including chargers for tools appliances 

Nails Polish, gel, acrylics, dips, nail accessories, supplies tools 

Skin and Cosmetics Cosmetics, cosmetic accessories, lashes and accessories, hair removal, skincare, jewelry 

Other Beauty Products Salon chairs, dryers, shampoo bowls, basics 

Additionally, as a top destination to shop for professional color and care, our goal is to be in-stock in these core categories at every opportunity. 
 	Sally Beauty Supply 
 SBS carries an extensive selection of leading third-party, owned and exclusive-labeled brand professional beauty products across a variety of categories. As leaders in the beauty industry, we believe we are uniquely positioned to adapt and innovate within our brands, partnerships and product offerings to provide the looks customers want. We believe this focus helps us attract new customers and keep long-term relationships with existing customers. During the fiscal year, we continued to focus on our owned brands, driving significant growth in our newest brands; bondbar, Inspired by Nature and Strawberry Leopard. Furthermore, we expanded our selection of mindful products, by adding Xmondo, Better Natured and Sauce Beauty, that are vegan-free, cruelty free, consciously packaged and provide charitable contributions to communities. Lastly, we continue to grow our nail category with a large selection of dips, gels and press on nails. 
 We believe that many of our owned brands, available only at SBS, offer equal or better quality than leading third-party brands. During the fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, our SBS U.S.- and Canada-owned brand sales have been approximately 34 , 34 , and 32 , respectively, of total SBS U.S. and Canada sales. 
 	Beauty Systems Group 
 BSG carries an extensive, industry-leading selection of third-party branded products, many of which have exclusive distribution rights with us. We are a trusted partner to the licensed stylist community and therefore have competitive prices across a variety of product categories. Our assortment and distribution are unique in certain geographies, and we continue to pursue the acquisition of additional distribution rights as well as expand our channels of operations with our existing brand portfolio. As one of the largest North American distributors of professional hair color and care products, carrying an extensive selection of branded merchandise and educating on the latest technology and techniques are critical to maintaining relationships with our community of professional stylists and estheticians.

Marketing and Advertising 
 	Sally Beauty Supply 
 We target existing and potential customers through an integrated marketing approach designed to reach the customer through a variety of media channels, including digital advertising, e-mail, social media, text messaging, mobile app push notifications, direct mail, radio and experiential advertising. 
 SBS s marketing initiatives are designed to drive customer traffic through added education, content and community building. We leverage a combination of internal and external influencers/content experts to educate and make customers feel confident about DIY hair color, hair care, nails and other beauty trends. Our external influencers consist of content creators and/or professional stylists who are DIY experts in their areas of focus and aim to inspire, educate and empower beauty enthusiasts. Additionally, our internal Sally Beauty Associate Affiliate Program encourages our associates to share their unique expertise with customers on social media to curate a community of inspiring, diverse creators who are using SBS merchandise for their DIY beauty, nails, hair and self-expression. 
 	Beauty Systems Group 
 BSG s marketing programs are designed to promote its extensive selection of brand partners' products at competitive prices and to educate, motivate and empower existing and potential customers. We work closely with our vendors to provide promotional offers for certain products to target existing and potential customers. We distribute promotional material through multiple channels, including print mail, e-mail, SMS, mobile app push notifications, social media, trade shows, educational events, virtual education events, store personnel and DSCs. As of September 30, 2024, we had a network of 652 DSCs who personally consult, support and sell directly to salons and salon professionals. In addition, we believe that our digital platforms enhance other efforts intended to promote awareness of our products by salons and salon professionals. 
 Customer Loyalty 
 In the U.S. and Canada, we have approximately 16 million loyal customers, of which a majority are part of our Sally Beauty Rewards Program. Our Sally Beauty Rewards Program is designed to earn SBS customer loyalty and was recognized as one of America s Best Loyalty Programs by Newsweek and Statista in recent years. The program is free to join, and it provides our loyalty customers the ability to earn points on their SBS purchases and to convert those points to Sally Beauty Rewards when certain thresholds are attained. Through the program, these customers may also receive exclusive savings and personalized marketing offers. 
 The following table highlights the size of the Sally Beauty Rewards membership and the percentage of sales for which their membership accounts:

In the U.S., we also offer our SBS customers the opportunity to apply for the Sally Beauty Rewards Credit Card which provides additional benefits to Sally Beauty Rewards members. Additionally, we offer our SBS professional customers and BSG customers the opportunity to apply for the Cosmo Prof Rewards Credit Card, which provides (i) discounts on Cosmo Prof purchases or (ii) points through the Sally Beauty Rewards Program on SBS purchases. 
 Through these programs, we are able to collect valuable point-of-sale customer data in order to increase our understanding of customers and enhance our ability to personalize our marketing. We will continue to monitor and adjust our Sally Beauty Rewards Program in an effort to further enhance our customer experience and promote repeat sales from both retail customers and salon professionals. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, our customer loyalty and marketing programs vary by marketplace. 
 Digital Strategy 
 We continue to grow our digital footprint, not only through our marketing and customer relationship efforts, but also through our digital platforms in each segment. We believe we are uniquely positioned to continue expanding our digital sales penetration thanks to our omni-channel business model, which enables us to meet our customers where they are: in store or online, or through a hybrid approach such as our buy online, pick up in store ("BOPIS") option. Additionally, our digital strategy of enhancing our customer centricity aims to expand our services ecosystem to 
 - 4 - 

support professional stylists as well as increase education and expertise to inspire and support all of our customers. For the fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, our global e-commerce sales represented approximately 9.8 , 9.3 , and 8.7 , respectively, of our consolidated sales. 
 To that end, we are excited to continue our digital expansion through our recent initiatives, such as expanding online digital marketplaces and our LCOD featured on our website, www.sallybeauty.com . 
 In SBS, we offer LCOD to provide our customers with a more engaging shopping experience. Our LCOD is a digital-focused initiative where customers can live chat with a licensed colorist by text, voice or video to learn more about our hair color product offerings and how to use our products to achieve their desired results. This online option is available in all 50 states and appears as a chat box when customers are browsing our selection of hair color merchandise on our website. As mentioned above, we are seeing positive insights and customer feedback around our LCOD initiative. Furthermore, over the past few years, we launched digital marketplaces with Walmart.com and Amazon.com, and this year expanded to other online partners, like DoorDash and Instacart, to fuel digital sales growth and attract new customers to our Sally brands. 
 Distribution 
 We currently receive our merchandise through several distribution centers in the U.S. and various other countries. Our distribution centers service our stores, orders from our DSCs and ship-to-customer orders through various freight carriers. We procure our owned brand merchandise through domestic and foreign vendors and work closely with our overseas vendors to fulfill production orders and schedule ocean and freight carriers to deliver to our distribution centers. 
 Over the past several years, we have made significant investments in our end-to-end supply chain systems and processes to build a best-in-class merchandising and supply chain platform for the future. As a result, we were recently able to adjust to a new shipping frequency from our distribution centers to a majority of our SBS and BSG stores in the U.S. and Canada by leveraging investments within our supply chain systems. This change has resulted in improved labor productivity and reduced freight costs, while allowing us to maintain healthy in-stock levels. 
 Additionally, customers are looking for more convenient options for receiving merchandise, which is helping drive their purchasing decisions. As such, we have made significant investments to meet them where they are. When ordering through our digital platforms, our customers can select different fulfillment options, including the following: BOPIS; deliver by common carrier (from store or distribution centers); 2-hour delivery; and fulfilling from certain digital marketplaces. 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is generally not seasonal. 
 Our Competition 
 The primary competitive factors in our industry are: the price of branded and owned brand products; exclusive distribution contracts; the quality, perceived value, brand name recognition, packaging and variety of the products sold; customer service; efficiency of distribution networks; and the availability of desirable store locations. 
 SBS competes primarily with beauty product wholesale and retail outlets, including local and regional open-line beauty supply stores, professional-only beauty supply stores, mass merchandisers, online retailers, drug stores, department stores and supermarkets as well as salons that sell hair care products. BSG competes primarily with beauty product wholesale suppliers, including online retailers and manufacturers selling their products directly to salons and salon professionals. 
 We face competition from certain manufacturers that use their own sales forces to distribute their professional beauty products directly or that align themselves with our competitors. Some of these manufacturers are vertically integrated through the acquisition of distributors and stores. We also face competition from authorized and unauthorized retailers as well as internet sites offering professional salon-only products that are not brand-approved for distribution. 
 Our Suppliers 
 We purchase our branded merchandise directly from manufacturers through supply contracts and purchase orders. For fiscal year 2024, our five largest suppliers Henkel AG Co. KGaA; Wella Company; the Professional Products Division of L'Oreal USA S/D, Inc.; John Paul Mitchell Systems; and Kao Corporation accounted for approximately 
 - 5 - 

47 of our consolidated merchandise purchases. We have developed long-standing, relationships, some of which are exclusive, with these suppliers and many others, which we believe are core to our competitive advantage. We purchase products from these and many other manufacturers on an at-will basis or under contracts which can generally be terminated without cause upon 90 days or less notice or that expire without express rights of renewal. 
 Intellectual Property 
 In the U.S. and in other countries where we operate, we have registered or legally protected trademarks, copyrights, internet domain names, service marks and trade names that are used to promote and market our business, stores, digital platforms and products. We believe many of these are well recognized and have significant value, including but not limited to the following: Sally , Sally Beauty , Cosmo Prof , Armstrong McCall , ION and Beyond the Zone . 
 Our Company Purpose Values 
 Our Company Purpose Values are intended to establish our rallying cry and focus our teams on the impact we intend to have in the world. 
 	Our Purpose: TO INSPIRE A MORE COLORFUL, CONFIDENT AND WELCOMING WORLD 
 	Our Values: 
 BE YOURSELF. Come as you are everyone is welcome here. 

BE AN INSPIRATION. Share your passion and knowledge with your team, your customers, the world. 

BE BOLD. Dive in. Move fast. Say yes. 

BE AN OWNER. Drive growth. Create your future. 

BE PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER. Take care of each other, our community and our planet. 

More information on our Purpose Values can be found at: www.sallybeautyholdings.com/our-company/purpose-and-values . 
 Human Capital Management 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 27,000 global associates, including approximately 12,000 full-time associates. We believe they are our greatest asset, with their combined skills, knowledge, work/life experiences and capabilities. At the front line interacting with our customers or behind the scenes supporting our field teams, our associates play a major role in our business. While we often emphasize our technology-based transformations and our wide variety of professional beauty products as key attributes, nothing happens or succeeds without our people. 
 In return for what they do for us, we strive to, among other things: 
 Ensure our associates work in a safe, healthy environment; 

Provide competitive compensation and benefits packages that attract and retain talent in every facet of our business stores, direct sales, distribution centers and corporate headquarters. Our benefits range from medical, dental and vision care including options for our part-time associates to 401(k), short and long-term disability and a robust Employee Assistance Program. Starting fiscal year 2023, we began providing six weeks of paid parental leave for mothers, fathers or partners upon the birth or placement of a child; 

Provide meaningful, engaging learning and development that grows our associates knowledge of and capability with respect to our business and skills that will help them in business and life; and 

Create an environment and culture where everyone can bring their true self to work because our differences are what make us beautiful. At SBH, we believe our focus on Diversity, Inclusion Belonging are crucial to improving how we interact with and influence our associates, customer environments and broader communities. We are committed to being a force for change. 

Associate Health Safety 
 We strive to create a safe and healthy work environment for all associates. 
 We place a high value on the health and safety of our associates, customers, suppliers and vendors. This commitment is evidenced, in part, by our background check policy for new hires, training and policy implementations related to 
 - 6 - 

handling both associate and customer incidents, partnerships to maintain the stores and make necessary repairs, as well as ongoing support in the field and at the support center. 
 Additionally, we value our partnerships with suppliers and vendors and understand the impact they can have on our associates. Thus, SBH has included rules governing their conduct, both with respect to expectations while interacting with our associates and, for our foreign suppliers, assurances that they too are providing a safe and healthy working environment for their associates. 
 Labor Practices 
 We provide competitive wages and benefits in a positive work environment where we focus on doing what is right. 
 We are an Equal Opportunity Employer with up-to-date policies, procedures and practices with respect to important issues such as safety, discrimination, harassment and retaliation. We provide focused training on these issues to our associates and managers. 
 We clearly communicate that any concerns related to issues such as discrimination, harassment, retaliation and other issues such as wage law compliance and fraud should be reported immediately. We also communicate the avenues available to our associates to do so through our SBH CARES communications and posters. The reporting avenues include options to do so by phone or online through our Employee Concern Line and to do so anonymously if an associate prefers to take that approach. 
 We ensure compliance with other important labor and employment law issues through a variety of processes and procedures, using both internal and external expertise and resources. 
 We also emphasize the importance of taking care of our associates in our Company s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the standard of conduct that applies to all of our associates, executive officers and Board of Directors (the "Board"). The Code reflects the core principles of conducting our business as a good corporate citizen in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to us and with regard for the welfare of our associates and providing equal opportunity to all associates and job applicants.

 Associate Engagement, Development and Culture 
 We live our values, listen to our associates and take action. 
 We make significant efforts to ensure our associates are informed, engaged and excited about the work they are doing and contributions they are making to our Company and our customers. We are committed to providing associates with what they need to thrive and grow their career. We significantly invest in our talent processes and set clear expectations around leadership competencies and our cultural values at all levels in the organization. At SBH, we consider the whole end-to-end talent cycle of an associate to ensure we select exceptional people to represent our business and best serve our customer. This includes robust interviewing processes as well as comprehensive onboarding programs to ensure new hires are set up to succeed in their early stages of joining SBH. There is also a strong cadence of completing regular cycles of performance management, linked to our Company values and leadership competencies, as well as regular reviews of our talent and succession pipelines. 
 Importantly, we devote significant effort and resources to the development of our associates, including providing almost all of our associates access to state-of-the-art learning management systems. We use these platforms to provide specifically designed and interactive award-winning e-learning courses in sales and service, product and hair knowledge, compliance training, and health and safety. 
 We also place significant value and attention on responding to feedback and input from associates. This includes surveys regarding issues such as Diversity, Inclusion Belonging and our engagement survey. We review our team s input and comments, identify common themes and set out action plans to respond. We believe listening is crucial, but taking action and making commitments are even more important. 
 As discussed below, our efforts around Diversity, Inclusion Belonging are a core focus of our associate engagement and culture. 
 Diversity, Inclusion Belonging 
 At SBH we celebrate differences, inclusivity and self-expression. This fundamental aspect of SBH s culture is rooted in our belief that beauty is for everyone, and everyone should find their own path to beauty. Our associates and our customers care about celebrating diversity and self-expression. We want our Company and our stores to be places where all of our associates and customers feel valued for who they are and experience a sense of belonging. 
 We come together to create a culture for One All 
 - 7 - 

Diversity, Inclusion Belonging are at the heart of who we are as a company at the Board level, throughout our global workforce and in our shared commitment to serving a diverse customer base and their communities. 
 Our Diversity, Inclusion Belonging Mission Statement: 
 We find beauty in YOU! 
 Finding beauty in diversity is in our DNA because our differences are what make us beautiful. Our diversity, inclusivity and self-expression are what fuel our innovation and growth. 
 At SBH, we come together to create a culture for ONE ALL. 
 At the Board Level : Our Board s composition leads the Company s commitment to Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging. Having diverse voices on our Board enhances the Board s expertise, broadens its viewpoint and sets the tone to encourage leaders at all levels of the Company to listen to the concerns of our associates and customers alike. Our Compensation Talent Committee provides hands-on oversight and guidance of our Diversity, Inclusion Belonging initiatives. Our Board believes listening and responding to diverse voices is crucial to the Company s success and long-term sustainability. 
 In Our Workforce : Our SBH team in the U.S. Canada is approximately 90 women and approximately 50 people of color. In recent years, Newsweek has recognized SBH among America s Greatest Workplaces, America s Greatest Workplaces for Diversity and America s Greatest Workplaces for Women. We recognize and celebrate the bedrock values of workforce diversity, inclusion, belonging and engagement within our teams. For us, these are key drivers of the success of the business, as our associates should and do reflect the various qualities of our customers and what they desire and expect from SBH. 
 During the fiscal year, we furthered our work with our existing Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"). Our first four ERGs represent our Black, Hispanic, Women and LGBTQ+ associates, and this year, we added two additional ERGs focused on Veterans and Associates with Disabilities/Neurodivergent Thinking. These ERGS have made a meaningful impact on our team and business, and we will continue to connect and engage them on how we do business, how we best serve our customers, and how we enhance our team and culture. 
 In Our Customer Base : Our customers span the entire continuum of gender and ethnic diversity. We sell beauty products to treat and style every kind of hair; we deliver a tailored assortment of beauty products that serve the local communities where our over 3,500 U.S. and Canada stores are located. Serving the diverse demographics and needs of our customers drives a culture and workforce that embraces and reflects the communities we serve. 
 We will continue to develop and evolve how we enhance Diversity, Inclusion Belonging throughout SBH. We recognize the value these initiatives bring to our Company, our associates, our customers and the communities we serve.

 Regulation 
 We are subject to a number of U.S., federal, state and local laws and regulations as well as the laws and regulations applicable in each foreign country or jurisdiction in which we do business. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the composition, packaging, labeling and safety of the products we sell, the methods we use to sell these products and the methods we use to import these products. 
 For example, in the U.S., most of the products we sell and the content and methods of advertising and marketing that we utilize are subject to both federal and state regulations administered by a host of federal and state agencies, including, in each case, and among other agencies, one or more of the following: the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. The transportation and disposal of many of our products are also subject to federal and state regulation. State and local agencies regulate many aspects of our business. We also face comprehensive regulation outside the U.S., focused primarily on product labeling and safety issues, such as cosmetic regulations administered by the EU Commission, Health Canada, Mexico COFEPRIS, and Chile ISP. We believe we are in material compliance with the laws and regulations to which we are subject, although no assurance can be provided that this will remain true going forward or that we will not be required to incur meaningful expenses to comply with such laws and regulations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we supplied franchised stores primarily located in the U.S. As a result of these franchisor-franchisee relationships, we are subject to regulation when offering and selling franchises. The applicable laws and 
 - 8 - 

regulations affect our business practices, as franchisor, in a number of ways, including restrictions placed upon the offering, renewal, termination and disapproval of assignment of franchises. To date, these laws and regulations have not had a material effect upon our operations.

ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 Important risk factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods are described below. These factors are not intended to be an all-encompassing list of risks and uncertainties and are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. 
 Operational, Strategic and General Business Risks 
 The beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating. 
 We face significant competition from other beauty stores and outlets, salons, mass merchandisers, online retailers, drug stores and supermarkets. The primary competitive factors in the beauty products distribution industry are price, quality, perceived value, consumer brand name recognition, packaging and variety and availability, customer service, desirable store locations, in-stock inventory and, with respect to e-commerce, look and feel of website and delivery times and costs. Competitive conditions may limit our ability to maintain prices or may require us to reduce prices to retain business or channel share, particularly because customers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison-shop and can determine real-time product availability using digital tools. This behavior can lead to decisions driven solely by price, the functionality of the digital tools, or a combination of these and other factors. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and are less leveraged than our business and may therefore be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities and may respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. Furthermore, there are few significant barriers to entry into the marketplace for most of the products we sell, making it easy for new market entrants to compete with us. We expect existing competitors, business partners and new entrants to the beauty products distribution industry to constantly revise or improve their business models in response to challenges from competing businesses, including ours. If these competitors introduce changes or developments that we cannot address in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business may be adversely affected. 
 In addition, our industry is consolidating, which may give our suppliers and our competitors increased negotiating leverage and greater marketing resources. For instance, we may lose customers if those competitors which have broad geographic reach attract additional salons (individual and chain) that are currently BSG customers, or if professional beauty supply manufacturers align themselves with our competitors or begin selling directly to customers. Not only does consolidation in distribution pose risks from competing distributors, but it may also place more leverage in the hands of certain manufacturers, resulting in smaller margins on products sold through our network. 
 If we are unable to compete effectively in our marketplace or if competitors divert our customers away from our networks, it would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be unable to anticipate and effectively respond to changes in consumer preferences and buying trends in a timely manner. 
 Our success depends in part on our ability, and our distributed third-party brands' ability, to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for specific beauty products. If we or the brands we distribute do not timely identify and properly respond to evolving trends and changing consumer demands for beauty products in the geographies in which we compete, our sales may decline significantly. Furthermore, we may accumulate additional inventory and be required to mark down unsold inventory to prices that are significantly lower than normal prices, which would adversely impact our margins and could further adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, a large percentage of our SBS product sales come from our owned and exclusive-label brand products. The development and promotion of these owned and exclusive-label brand products often occur well before these products are sold in our stores. As a result, the success of these owned and exclusive-label brand products is largely dependent on our ability to develop products that meet future consumer preferences at prices that are acceptable to our customers. Furthermore, we may have to invest significant amounts on the advertising and marketing of our owned and exclusive-label brands to drive customer awareness of these brands. There can be no assurance that any new owned or exclusive-label brand will meet consumer preferences, gain acceptance among our customer base or generate sales to become profitable or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. 
 - 10 - 

We expect continuously changing fashion-related trends and consumer tastes to influence future demand for beauty products. Changes in consumer tastes, fashion trends and brand reputation can have an impact on our financial performance. If we or third-party brands we distribute are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the marketplace for beauty products and changing consumer demands and/or maintain a strong brand reputation, our business could suffer. 
 Our future success depends in part on our ability to successfully implement our strategic initiatives to improve the customer experience, attract new customers and improve the sales productivity of our stores. 
 We are continuing the implementation of a significant number of strategic initiatives designed to enhance our customer centricity, increase our owned brand sales penetration, improve operational efficiencies and optimize our capabilities, including through the closure of underperforming stores and the consolidation of distribution centers. There can be no assurance that these or future strategic initiatives will be successful. Furthermore, we are investing significant resources in these initiatives and the costs of the initiatives may outweigh their benefits. If these strategic initiatives are not successful, our comparative sales will suffer and our growth prospects, financial results, profitability and cash flows will also be adversely impacted. 
 We depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us. 
 We do not manufacture any products we sell and instead purchase our products from recognized brand manufacturers and private label fillers. We depend on a limited number of manufacturers for a significant percentage of the products we sell. 
 Because we purchase products from many manufacturers and fillers pursuant to at-will contracts and contracts which can be terminated without cause upon 90 days notice or less, or which expire without express rights of renewal, manufacturers and fillers could discontinue sales to us immediately or upon short notice. Some of our contracts with manufacturers may be terminated if we fail to meet specified minimum purchase requirements. If minimum purchase requirements are not met, we do not have contractual assurances of continued supply. In lieu of termination, a manufacturer may also change the terms upon which it sells for example, by raising prices or broadening distribution to third parties. For these and other reasons, we may not be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities or on acceptable terms in the future. 
 Changes in SBS s and BSG s relationships with suppliers occur often and could positively or negatively impact the net sales and operating earnings of both business segments. Some of our suppliers may seek to decrease their reliance on distribution intermediaries, including full-service/exclusive and open-line distributors like BSG and SBS, by promoting their own distribution channels. These suppliers may offer advantages, such as lower prices, when their products are purchased from distribution channels they control. If our access to supplier-provided products were to diminish relative to our competitors or if we were not able to purchase products at the same prices as our competitors, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Further, consolidation among suppliers may increase suppliers' negotiating leverage, thereby providing them with competitive advantages that may increase our costs and reduce our revenues, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the impact of these developments, if they were to occur, would not adversely impact revenue or margins or that our efforts to mitigate the impact of these developments would be successful. 
 Furthermore, from time to time, our suppliers ship products to us that fail to conform to our quality control standards. Suppliers' failure to comply with our quality control program may result in diminished inventory levels and product quality, which in turn may result in increased order cancellations and product returns, decreased consumer demand for our products, or product recalls, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 - 11 - 

Any unexpected significant interruption in manufacturers' and fillers' supply of products or disruptions in our supply chain infrastructure could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores and customers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Manufacturers and owned and exclusive-label brand fillers of beauty supply products are subject to certain risks that could adversely impact their ability to provide us with their products on a timely basis. Such risks include the following: inability to procure ingredients; industrial accidents; environmental events; strikes and other labor disputes; union organizing activity; disruptions in logistics or information systems; loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites; product quality control; safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues; and natural disasters, pandemics and other external factors over which neither they nor we have control. 
 In addition, we directly source many of our owned and exclusive-label brand products, including, but not limited to, styling tools, salon equipment, sundries and other promotional products, from foreign third-party manufacturers and many of our vendors also use overseas sourcing to manufacture some or all of their products. Any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries, including the imposition of additional or increased import restrictions, duties or tariffs, political instability, local business practices, legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers ability to produce and deliver products or acts of war or terrorism or pandemics, could materially harm our operations to the extent they affect the production, shipment or receipt of merchandise. Our operating results depend on the orderly operation of our receiving and distribution processes, which depend on manufacturers adherence to shipping schedules and our effective management of our distribution facilities and capacity. 
 The loss of exclusive distribution rights with key vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We have exclusive and non-exclusive distribution rights with several key vendors for well-known brands in certain geographies. If key vendors ceased granting us exclusive distribution rights, or decided to utilize other distribution channels for their products, therefore widening the availability of these products in other channels, the revenue we earn from the sale of such products could be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of inventory may result in higher cost of goods, which we may not be able to pass on to the customers. 
 Our suppliers frequently attempt to pass on higher production costs, which have generally increased as a result of inflation over the past few years, which may impact our ability to maintain or grow our margins. The price and availability of raw materials may be impacted by inflation, demand, regulation, weather and other factors. Additionally, manufacturers have and may continue to experience increases in other manufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor and benefit costs. These increases in production costs result in higher merchandise costs to us. We may not always be able to pass on those cost increases to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our e-commerce businesses may be unsuccessful or, if successful, may redirect sales from our stores. 
 We offer many of our beauty products for sale through our e-commerce businesses in the U.S. (such as www.sallybeauty.com , www.cosmoprofbeauty.com , www.cosmoprofequipment.com and mobile commerce-based apps) and abroad. We have undertaken a number of initiatives to significantly advance our digital commerce capabilities and grow our e-commerce businesses. As a result, we are more susceptible to risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internet-based businesses, including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a cost-effective basis and our ability to operate, support, expand and develop our e-commerce operations, websites and software and other related operational systems. Furthermore, our e-commerce businesses face significant competition from larger retailers with more established e-commerce platforms, as well as online retailers, including Amazon, and online store e-commerce platforms, such as Shopify. 
 Although we believe our participation in both e-commerce and physical store sales is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers, supporting product offerings through both of these channels could create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations. For example, growth in our e-commerce business relative to in-store sales may result in dilution of operating margin and profit due to higher delivery expenses incurred in our e-commerce sales. Furthermore, as our e-commerce businesses successfully grow, they may 
 - 12 - 

do so in part by attracting existing customers, rather than new customers, who choose to purchase products from us online rather than from our physical stores, thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores. In addition, offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products. In addition, offering products through our e-commerce channels (particularly directly to consumers through our professional business) could cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider utilizing competitive internet offerings of their products either directly or through competing distributors. As we continue to grow our e-commerce businesses, the impact of attracting existing rather than new customers, of experiencing conflicts between product offerings online and through our stores, and of opening up our channels to increased internet competition could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including operating margin, profit, future growth and comparative sales. Furthermore, our recent initiatives to upgrade our e-commerce platforms may not be successful in driving traffic to our websites and increasing our online sales in the long term, which could adversely impact our net sales. 
 Diversion of professional products sold by BSG could have an adverse impact on our revenues. 
 The majority of the products that BSG sells, including those sold by our Armstrong McCall franchisees, are meant to be used exclusively by salons and individual salon professionals or sold exclusively to their retail consumers. However, despite our efforts to prevent diversion, incidents of product diversion occur, whereby our products are sold by these purchasers (and possibly by other bulk purchasers such as franchisees) to wholesalers and ultimately to general merchandise retailers, among others. These retailers, in turn, sell such products to consumers. The diverted product may be old, tainted or damaged and sold through unapproved outlets, all of which could diminish the value of the particular brand. In addition, such diversion may result in lower net sales for BSG should consumers choose to purchase diverted products from retailers rather than purchasing from our customers or choose to purchase other products altogether because of the perceived loss of brand prestige. Furthermore, in many instances, BSG is subject to certain anti-diversion obligations under these manufacturers contracts that, if violated, may result in the termination of such contracts. In addition, our investigation and enforcement of these anti-diversion obligations may require us to cease selling to customers suspected of diversion, which could impact BSG s net sales. 
 BSG s financial results are affected by the financial results of BSG s franchise-based Armstrong McCall business. 
 BSG receives revenue from its sale of products to Armstrong McCall franchisees. Accordingly, a portion of BSG s financial results is dependent upon the operational and financial success of these franchisees, including their implementation of BSG s strategic plans. If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for Armstrong McCall s franchisees, their financial results may worsen. Additionally, the failure of Armstrong McCall franchisees to renew their franchise agreements, any requirement that Armstrong McCall restructure its franchise agreements in connection with such renewals, or any failure of Armstrong McCall to meet its obligations under its franchise agreements, could result in decreased revenues for BSG or create legal issues with our franchisees or with manufacturers. 
 Furthermore, our franchisees may not run the stores and sales teams according to our standards, which could have a material adverse effect on our brand reputation and our business. 
 If we are unable to optimize our store base, by profitably opening and operating new stores and closing less profitable stores, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Our future growth strategy depends in part on our ability to optimize and profitably operate our stores in existing and additional geographic areas, including in international geographies, and to close underperforming stores. While the capital requirements to open an SBS or BSG store, excluding inventory, vary from geography to geography, such capital requirements have historically been relatively low in the U.S. and Canada. Despite these relatively low opening costs, we may not be able to open all the new stores we plan to open, and we may be unable to optimize our store base, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may incur costs associated with the closure of underperforming stores and such store closures may adversely impact our revenues. 
 In addition, as we continue to open new stores, our management as well as our financial, distribution and information systems and other resources will be subject to greater demands. If our personnel and systems are unable to successfully manage this increased burden, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected. 
 - 13 - 

We may, from time to time, seek to develop and introduce new store concepts. Our ability to succeed in the early stages of new concepts could require significant capital expenditures and management attention. Additionally, any new concept is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, product differentiation, challenges relating to economies of scale in merchandise sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including management and designers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow these or any other new concepts to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow. If we cannot successfully develop and grow these new concepts, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 
 If our marketing, advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising, marketing and promotional activities. We use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including social media (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube), websites, mobile applications, e-mail, and print. Our future growth and profitability will depend in part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising and marketing programs. Further, disruption to certain media channels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In particular, there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms including blogs, social media websites and other forms of digital communications and the influence of social medial influencers in the beauty products industry. Furthermore, social media advertising and marketing continues to increase in importance as consumers are paying less attention to more traditional media. As a result, the success of our marketing and advertising programs are increasingly dependent on the effectiveness of industry influencers that we engage to promote our products. Furthermore, actions taken by these individuals could harm our brand image and reputation. Our social media marketing efforts may not ultimately be successful, and the availability of these platforms may make it easier for smaller competitors to compete with us. 
 Negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may also be posted on social media platforms or other electronic means at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business. Customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. Any harm to us or the products we sell may be immediate without allowing us an opportunity for redress or correction. 
 If we fail to attract and retain highly skilled management and other personnel at all levels of the Company, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. 
 Our success has depended, and will continue to depend, in large part on our ability to attract and retain senior executives who possess extensive knowledge, experience and managerial skill applicable to our business. Significant leadership changes or executive management transitions involve inherent risk, and any failure to ensure the effective transfer of knowledge and a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, execution and future performance. In addition, from time to time, key executive personnel leave our Company, and we may not be successful in attracting, integrating and retaining the replacement personnel required to continue to grow and operate our business profitably. While we strive to mitigate the negative impact associated with the loss of a key executive employee, an unsuccessful transition or loss could significantly disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may similarly rely on other non-executive personnel and associates across our business, including those working in our corporate functions, to facilitate our ongoing operations and support our strategic initiatives. The recruitment and retention of qualified individuals in these roles are vital elements of the success of our business. 
 We are also dependent on recruiting, training, motivating, managing and retaining our store employees that interact with our customers on a daily basis. Many team members are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. Competition for these types of qualified employees, especially in light of recent labor shortages among entry-level workers, is intense and the failure to attract, retain and properly train qualified and motivated employees could result in decreased customer satisfaction, loss of customers and lower sales. In addition, our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, immigration, minimum wage and healthcare benefits; changing demographics; and our reputation within the labor market. Our inability to control our labor costs could affect our results of operations and could result in lower margins in our two segments. 
 - 14 - 

The integration and use of artificial intelligence (AI) and similar technology in our business presents risks and challenges that could adversely affect our business, reputation, and results of operations. 
 We are in the early stages of integrating AI in our business, including machine learning AI and generative AI tools that collect and analyze data to support our business operations and customer-facing interactions. We also use products and services from third parties that use integrated AI technology. The use of AI tools and technology presents many challenges and risks to our business. Data sets used by AI may be overbroad, insufficient or contain flawed or otherwise biased information. AI tools that we use may include flaws in algorithms, which may create biased or inaccurate outcomes, and may generate offensive, illegal, malicious or otherwise harmful content that could adversely impact our brand, reputation, business, or customers. Since we use AI in customer-facing interactions, any inaccuracies in AI responses could affect customer satisfaction, lead to misinformation, and harm our brand's reputation. Unintended use of AI may lead to regulatory issues, reputational or financial harm, and operational disruptions. The use of AI may also increase the risks to us of data breaches, malware, ransomware, data loss and theft, or the improper handling of sensitive information, which could result in adverse financial and regulatory consequences. The rapid development and adoption of AI and AI-adjacent technology, and of AI s competitive use cases, may make it more difficult for us to compete in our industry. Our competitors may have greater success implementing and using AI technology than us, which could harm our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, we may become increasingly reliant on AI technology and tools in the future. The legal, regulatory and compliance environment surrounding the design and use of AI technology involving federal, state and foreign regulators -- is evolving and complex. Our obligation to comply with the evolving regulatory landscape could entail significant costs and negatively affect our business. In addition, there has been a significant increase in AI-related litigation and government regulatory actions targeting the design, deployment and other uses of AI, and claiming liability under numerous areas of the law, such as consumer protection, product liability, privacy, intellectual property, securities and defamation. Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. 
 General Economic, Market and Foreign Risks 
 The political, social and economic conditions in the geographies we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy and regulatory environment generally, both in the U.S. and internationally. Concerns over inflation, rising interest rates, labor shortages, energy costs, geopolitical issues, and conflicts and wars, as well as uncertainty with respect to elections, terrorism, civil unrest, the availability and cost of credit, the mortgage market, and the real estate and other financial markets in the U.S. and Europe have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the U.S. and certain foreign economies. We appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and salons and salon professionals. Continued uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products as well as adversely impact the frequency of salon services performed by professionals using products purchased from us. Factors that could affect consumers willingness to make such discretionary purchases include the following: inflation, general business conditions, levels of employment, interest rates, tax rates, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. A prolonged economic downturn or acute recession can adversely affect consumer spending habits and result in lower than expected net sales. The economic climate could also adversely affect our vendors. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, the disruption to the global economy and to our business, along with any sustained decline in our stock price, could lead to triggering events that may indicate that the carrying value of certain assets including inventories, accounts receivable, long-lived assets, intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable, which could lead to impairment or other asset write-downs in the future. 
 Price inflation for labor, materials and services could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 During the fiscal year, inflationary pressures have eased, but over the past few years, we experienced considerable price inflation in costs for labor, materials and services. While inflation is stabilizing, we may not be able to continue 
 - 15 - 

to pass through inflationary cost increases and, if inflationary pressures return, we may only be able to recoup a portion of our increased costs in future periods. Our ability to raise prices to reflect increased costs may also be limited by competitive conditions in the market for our products. 
 The occurrence of large-scale catastrophes or crises, including natural disasters, acts of violence, conflicts, wars or terrorism and global health crises, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. 
 The occurrence of natural disasters (the severity and frequency of which may be exacerbated by climate change), acts of violence, conflicts, wars, terrorism or civil unrest or global health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, could result in physical damage to our properties, the temporary closure of stores or distribution centers, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products (or a substantial increase in the cost of those products) from domestic or foreign suppliers, the temporary disruption in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers (or a substantial increase in the cost of those deliveries), the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and/or the temporary reduction in visits to stores by customers. If one or more natural disasters or acts of violence, conflicts, wars or terrorism were to impact our business, we could, among other things, incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing products. Furthermore, insurance costs associated with our business may rise significantly in the event of a large-scale catastrophe or crisis. 
 Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. 
 Many of our products are sold outside of the United States. As a result, we conduct transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Recently, these foreign currencies have weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar. Our international revenues and expenses are generally derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial reporting. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials, transportation and freight more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations could similarly have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We are subject to risks related to our international operations. 
 We operate on a global basis, and approximately 19 of our net revenues from continuing operations in fiscal year 2024 were generated outside the U.S. Our non-U.S. operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including those resulting from ongoing instability or changes in a country s or region s economic, regulatory or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations, sovereign default risk and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, labor market disruptions, sanctions, boycotts, new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or other restrictions on foreign businesses, our failure to effectively and timely implement processes and policies across our diverse operations and employee base and difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex and potentially conflicting regulations across multiple jurisdictions. The presence of non-U.S. operations also increases the risk of non-compliance with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to such non-U.S. operations, such as those laws and regulations relating to sanctions, boycotts and improper payments. 
 In addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions as a consequence of the occurrence, or threat of, large-scale international events such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action, including the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East, pandemics or other crises or vulnerabilities or as a result of adverse weather conditions or climate changes, may have an impact on consumer spending, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our securities. 
 A reduction in traffic to, or the closing of, other retailers in shopping areas where our SBS stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. 
 As a result of our real estate strategy, most of our SBS stores are located in strip shopping centers. These strip shopping centers are occupied by other high-traffic retailers such as grocery stores, mass merchants and home improvement centers. Because most of our SBS stores are located in strip shopping centers, our sales are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic generated by the nearby high-traffic retailers. A reduction in customer traffic to these strip shopping centers, including as a result of the closure of stores in the strip shopping center, a regional or global economic 
 - 16 - 

downturn, an outbreak of flu or other viruses (such as COVID-19), a general downturn in the local area where our SBS store is located, or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular strip shopping center, could reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. 
 Regulatory, Legal and Cybersecurity Risks 
 Legal proceedings, including litigation, regulatory proceedings, and other claims, and the outcome of such proceedings, litigation or claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows. 
 From time to time, we are a party to claims, litigation, including single-plaintiff and class action litigation, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters involving employment, premises, real estate, and product litigation. These matters could ultimately result in losses or liabilities to our business. Liabilities for loss contingencies, including those arising from such proceedings, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. There is inherent uncertainty in the assessment of the potential outcomes of these matters, and the ultimate resolution of these matters could differ from our predictions. Such outcomes may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on litigation and other legal proceedings. 
 If products sold by us are found to be defective in labeling or content, our credibility and that of the brands we sell may be harmed, marketplace acceptance of our products may decrease, and we may be exposed to liability that exceeds our products liability insurance coverage and manufacturer indemnities. 
 We do not control the production process for the products we sell. We may not be able to identify a defect in a product we purchase from a manufacturer or owned and exclusive-label brand filler before we offer such product for resale. In many cases, we rely on manufactures' and fillers' representations regarding the composition, manufacture and safety of the products we purchase from them, as well as on the compliance of our product labels with government regulations. Our sale of certain products exposes us to potential product liability claims, recalls or other regulatory or enforcement actions initiated by federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or through private causes of action. Such claims, recalls or actions could be based on allegations that, among other things, the products sold by us are misbranded, contain contaminants or impermissible ingredients, provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or misuse, include inadequate warnings concerning flammability or interactions with other substances or that we knew or should have known of an alleged defect. For example, numerous cases continue to be filed against beauty product manufacturers and distributors, alleging harm from chemical hair straighteners and hair relaxer products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Claims against us could also arise as a result of the misuse by purchasers of such products or as a result of their use in a manner different than the intended use. We may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or allegedly caused by the products we sell and to recall any product we sell that is alleged to be or is found to be defective. Furthermore, such claims could have an adverse impact on our reputation. 
 Any actual defects or allegations of defects in products sold by us could result in adverse publicity and could harm our credibility or the credibility of the manufacturer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we may have both indemnification rights against the manufacturers of many of the products we distribute and rights as an additional insured under the manufacturers insurance policies, it is not certain that any manufacturer or insurer will be financially solvent and capable of making payment to any party suffering loss or injury caused by products sold by us or that all losses would be covered by such indemnification rights or insurance policies. If we are forced to expend significant resources and time to resolve such claims or to pay material amounts to satisfy such claims, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We could be adversely affected if we do not comply with current laws and regulations or if we become subject to additional or more stringent laws and regulations. 
 We are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. as well as applicable laws and regulations in each foreign marketplace in which we do business. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the composition, packaging, labeling and safety of the products we sell as well as the methods we use to sell 
 - 17 - 

and import these products. Non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations of governmental authorities, including the FDA and similar authorities in other jurisdictions by us or the manufacturers and fillers of the products sold by us could result in fines, product recalls and enforcement actions and could otherwise restrict our ability to market certain products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, the laws and regulations applicable to us or manufacturers of the products sold by us may become more stringent. Failure to comply with these new and existing regulations could result in significant fines or damages, in addition to costs and expenses necessary to defend claims related thereto. Manufacturers may try to recover some or all of any increased cost of compliance by increasing the prices at which we purchase products, and we may not be able to recover some or all of such increased cost in our own prices to our customers. We are also subject to state and local laws and regulations that affect our franchisor-franchisee relationships. Increased compliance costs and the loss of sales of certain products due to more stringent or new laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Climate change and other environmental impacts, and increased focus by stakeholders on environmental issues, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Climatologists predict that the long-term effects of climate change and global warming will result in the increased frequency, intensity and duration of weather events, which could significantly disrupt supply chains, potentially impacting our vendors raw material costs and the production of products we sell. These weather events could also lead to an increased rate of temporary store closures and reduced customer traffic at our stores. 
 In addition, concern over climate change may result in new or increased regional, federal or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change and greenhouse gases. These requirements may lead to an increase in tax, transportation and utility expenses. 
 Lastly, there is increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, climate impact and recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including plastic. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment. 
 Failure to meet evolving expectations concerning environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") reporting could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. 
 Expectations from investors, customers, team members, government agencies and other third parties concerning ESG reporting have increased, and our ability to meet those evolving expectations is dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including (i) cooperation from and access to sourcing vendors and other third parties that meet our standards; (ii) access to consistent and reliable data; (iii) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures; and (iv) the availability and cost of raw materials that meet and further our sustainability and ESG goals. Negative customer perceptions regarding the safety and sourcing of the products we sell and the sufficiency and transparency of our reporting on ESG matters and events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived compliance and social responsibility concerns could hurt our reputation, result in lost sales, cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs and make it difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers. Furthermore, costs associated with ESG initiatives may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our competitors ability to develop effective ESG practices and initiatives, and any perceived failure or inadequacy of our own such initiatives, may also have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or if our products are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, it could materially and negatively impact our business. 
 We rely upon trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our trademarks, certain of which are material to our business, are registered or legally protected in the U.S., Canada and other countries in which we operate. The success of our business depends to a certain extent upon the value associated with our intellectual property rights. We protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, applying for and obtaining trademark protection in the U.S., Canada and other countries throughout the world in which our business operates. We also rely on trade secret laws, in addition to confidentiality agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information. While we intend to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement, we may not be successful. In addition, the laws of certain 
 - 18 - 

foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. The costs required to protect our intellectual property rights and trademarks are expected to continue to be substantial. 
 Furthermore, the industry in which we operate is characterized by the need for a large number of copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. A third party may at any time assert that our products violate such party s intellectual property rights. Successful intellectual property claims against us could result in significant financial liabilities and/or prevent us from selling certain of our products. In addition, the resolution of infringement claims may require us to redesign our products, to obtain licenses to use intellectual property belonging to third parties, which may not be attainable on reasonable terms, or to cease using the intellectual property altogether. 
 We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems. 
 Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages or delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and could adversely affect our customer service and relationships. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including, without limitation, fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems disruptions, systems conversions, security breaches, cyberattacks, phishing attacks, viruses and/or human error. In any such event, we could be required to make a significant investment to fix or replace our information technology systems, and we could experience interruptions in our ability to service customers. Such delays, problems or costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining their reliability and integrity. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. The development and implementation of new systems and any other future upgrades to our systems and information technology may require significant costs and could divert our management s attention and other resources from our core business. There are also no assurances that these new systems and upgrades will provide us with the anticipated benefits and efficiencies. Some of our systems are proprietary and, as a result, our options are limited in seeking third-party help with the operation and upgrade of those systems. There can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to operations and upgrades, any delays due to the installation of any upgrade (and customer issues therewith), any resulting service outages, or the impact on the reliability of our data from any upgrade or any legacy system will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, control environment or results of operations. 
 Unauthorized access to confidential information and data on our information technology systems, security and data breaches. 
 As part of our operations, we, together with third parties acting on our behalf, receive, process and maintain sensitive and confidential information about our customers, employees and other third parties. Processing, maintenance and transmission of information is a critical part of our business operations. We have physical, technical and procedural safeguards in place that are designed to protect information and protect against security and data breaches, fraudulent transactions and other disruptive activities. We believe that our security safeguards follow appropriate practices for prevention of security and data breaches and the mitigation of cybersecurity risks. Despite these safeguards and our other security processes and protections, our systems and processes may be vulnerable to security breaches and cyber-attacks, which are evolving and increasingly sophisticated (such as denial-of-service, ransomware, phishing, supply chain and social engineering attacks), as well as to physical breach, vandalism, sabotage, user malfeasance, viruses, misplaced or lost data and inadvertent data disclosure by third parties or us. 
 A significant data security breach, including misappropriation of our customers or employees confidential information, could result in significant costs to us, which may include, among others, potential liabilities to payment card networks for reimbursements of credit card fraud and card reissuance costs, including fines and penalties, potential liabilities from governmental or third-party investigations, proceedings or litigation, legal, forensic and consulting fees and expenses, costs and diversion of management attention required for investigation and remediation actions, and the negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our customers, suppliers and others, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Relatedly, 
 - 19 - 

if our third-party suppliers or vendors are subject to cyber-attacks, data breaches, other security incidents, or disruption of information technology systems or software, such events could expose us to liability, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business. While we carry insurance that would mitigate losses in connection with security breaches and cyber incidents, insurance may be insufficient to fully compensate us for potentially significant losses. 
 We understand that the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target; accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. The failure to promptly detect, determine the extent of and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Failure to comply with rapidly evolving data privacy laws could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results 
 We are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and non-U.S. laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy and security, the scope and impact of which are uncertain. Several governments, as well as the European Union ("EU"), have regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their citizens, regulators are also globally imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations, and there is an increase in private rights of action. In 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA expanded consumer privacy rights and extended application of the California Consumer Privacy Act to our California employees. A number of other U.S. states have enacted consumer privacy laws that are expected to take effect in 2024 and beyond or have revived existing state laws with new meaning, potentially subjecting retailers to privacy-based class action lawsuits. 
 We also expect to see rapid changes and corresponding regulator and private rights of action related to the use of text messaging to communicate with customers, the collection and use of biometric data and dark patterns. We continue to monitor our compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR of both the EU, which regulates how organizations handle the personal data of both EU citizens and individuals residing in the EU, and the UK, the latter of which has been applicable post-Brexit. Data privacy is, and may continue to be, a rapidly evolving area of law. Any potential inability to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and principles, or to quickly adapt our practices to reflect them as they develop, could potentially subject us to significant fines, damages, liabilities and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Financial Risks 
 Our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons. 
 Our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance, including the following: 
 changes in our merchandising strategy or mix; 

the fact that a portion of a typical new store s sales come from customers who previously shopped at other existing stores; 

the timing and effectiveness of our marketing and promotional activities and those of our competitors; 

the effects of severe weather events or other natural disasters; 

the number of shopping days in a quarter; 

fluctuations in the cost to purchase products we sell; 

store closures in response to state or local regulations due to health concerns; and 

worldwide economic conditions and, in particular, the retail sales environment in North America and Europe. 

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect our quarterly financial performance. Accordingly, our results, including comparable sales, for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected 
 - 20 - 

for any other quarter, and may even decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates. 
 Outstanding borrowings under our 500 million asset-based senior secured loan facility ("ABL facility") and our term loan B facility ("term loan B") are subject to variable rates of interest and therefore expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on any variable rate indebtedness would increase, even if the principal amount borrowed remained the same, and our net earnings and cash flows would correspondingly decrease. We are currently party to, and may enter into in the future, additional, derivative instruments, such as interest rate caps and swaps, to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates on our term loan B. We may not maintain derivative instruments with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, however, and any instruments we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. 
 We have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial health, our ability to obtain financing in the future and our ability to react to changes in our business. 
 As of September 30, 2024, certain of our subsidiaries, including Sally Holdings LLC ("Sally Holdings"), had an aggregate principal amount of approximately 1.0 billion of outstanding debt. 
 Our substantial debt could have significant consequences. For example, it could have the following impact: 
 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our lenders, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness; 

limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes; 

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes; 

restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us, which could limit our ability to conduct repurchases of our own equity securities or pay dividends to our stockholders, thereby limiting our ability to enhance stockholder value through such transactions; 

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations (because a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest), including borrowings under our ABL facility and our term loan B; 

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have proportionately less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and who, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; 

require us to comply with restrictive covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, pay dividends, conduct share repurchases, make acquisitions, dispose of assets or prepay debt; 

limit our ability to refinance indebtedness or cause the associated costs of such refinancing to increase; and 

limit our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures, or prevent us from carrying out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins or our business. 

Any of the foregoing impacts of our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Each of our ABL facility, term loan B and senior notes contain certain covenants and restrictions with which we are required to comply. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default under the relevant governing instruments, which could permit the applicable lenders or senior note holders, as the case may be, to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay debt, lenders holding secured obligations, such as the lenders under the ABL 
 - 21 - 

facility, could proceed against the collateral that secures such unpaid debt. In any such case, our subsidiaries may be unable to borrow under the ABL facility and may not be able to repay the amounts due under the senior notes and the term loan B. This could result in serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent. 
 In addition, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. As of September 30, 2024, our ABL facility provided us commitments for additional borrowings of up to approximately 482.5 million, subject to borrowing base limitations, outstanding letters of credit and limitations on cash hoarding above certain balances, once utilized. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we face would increase, and we may not be able to meet all our debt obligations. 
 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLV ED STAFF COMMENTS 
 Not applicable. 
 ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 Risk Management Strategies 
 Our Company is committed to protecting the privacy and security of customer information and the integrity of our information technology systems. We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program Cybersecurity Program that is tailored to address specific risks in the retail industry, using a flexible approach informed by our deep understanding of attacker methodologies, targeted assets, and industry best practices. The Cybersecurity Program is intended to protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our information and critical systems by continually monitoring, assessing, identifying, and mitigating cybersecurity risks. The Cybersecurity Program is part of our integrated risk management process and includes, but is not limited to, the following features: 
 Regularly simulated phishing attacks and comprehensive cybersecurity training for all employees, with special focus on high-risk individuals using a new security awareness platform. 

Cybersecurity insurance coverage to mitigate financial impacts from potential cyber incidents. 

Endpoint detection and response technologies (EDR) to monitor systems continuously for malicious activity. 

Behavior analytics tools that help track normal behavior patterns and quickly detect any anomalies. 

Cloud security measures, offering comprehensive protection and vulnerability management for our cloud environments. 

Digital risk protection that includes brand protection, social media monitoring, dark web surveillance, and proactive response to phishing, fraud, and account takeovers. 

Zero-day vulnerability management, with third-party monitoring to prioritize critical vulnerabilities based on real-time risk assessments and active exploitation. 

Comprehensive vendor risk management program, including penetration tests, Service Organization Control ("SOC") reports, and security architecture reviews, especially for third parties managing sensitive data or accessing internal systems. 

In addition, we have a written cybersecurity incident response plan Response Plan that is reviewed and updated, if necessary, at least annually. The Response Plan includes a cross-functional incident response team comprised of various key executive representatives from different departments in our organization, such as our Chief Information Security Officer CISO and General Counsel, that are tasked with assessing the scope, nature, and potential impact of incidents. Findings are reported to the Chief Executive Officer CEO ), Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), our Board and the Disclosure Committee, the latter of which is comprised of senior representatives from our finance, accounting, internal audit and legal departments under the supervision of the CEO and CFO. 
 We also regularly engage third parties to perform assessments on the Cybersecurity Program, including an annual self-assessed risk review facilitated by an independent third party, where we evaluate various cybersecurity domains and control areas and benchmark our program against industry peers. Additionally, we conduct annual third-party penetration tests focused on our highest-risk areas globally, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities. These 
 - 22 - 

assessments are supplemented by red team exercises and real-world incident response simulations to continually improve our security posture. 
 From time to time, we experience cybersecurity threats and incidents. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not identified any instances that have occurred in the current year, or in prior years, that would have a material impact on our Company or on our results of operation, or financial position. For more information related to our cybersecurity risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Regulatory, Legal and Cybersecurity Risks within this annual report. 
 Governance 
 Our Board understands the critical importance of managing evolving risks associated with cybersecurity threats. The Board has responsibility for overseeing risks related to the cybersecurity threat landscape, including data protection and security breach readiness. Our CISO reports directly to the Chief Information Officer and is responsible for the operation of our Cybersecurity Program. Our CISO brings over 26 years of experience in information security, including the last 12 years as a Chief Information Security Officer in the retail industry. With a diverse background in both industry and consulting, our CISO has led major security programs, implementing practical strategies to protect critical data and systems. 
 On at least a quarterly basis, the CISO delivers a detailed report to the full Board including Board member Erin Nealy Cox on data protection and cybersecurity matters. Topics covered by these reports include, but are not limited to, risk identification and management strategies, cybersecurity strategy and governance structure, consumer data protection, the Company s ongoing risk mitigation activities, learnings from data security incidents of peer companies, results of third-party assessments and testing, updates on annual associate training and other specific training initiatives. Ms. Nealy Cox is an independent member of our Board, a cybersecurity expert and a former federal prosecutor with deep expertise in information security issues and board governance. She is a partner at Kirkland Ellis LLP in its Government, Regulatory and Internal Investigations Group, and was executive managing director at Stroz Friedberg, a cybersecurity and investigation consulting firm, where she ultimately led the firm s incident response business, from 2003-2016. In 2017, she served briefly as senior advisor to McKinsey Company in the firm s cybersecurity and risk practice.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are involved, from time to time, in various claims, administrative proceedings and lawsuits incidental or related to the conduct of our business, which may range from single-plaintiff to class action litigation. We carry insurance coverage in such amounts in excess of our self-insured retention as we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and may or may not cover any or all of our liabilities in respect of these matters. Although the ultimate disposition of these claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, there can be no assurances that future adverse judgments and costs would not be material to our financial position, cash flows or results of operations for a particular period. See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on legal proceedings.

Global e-commerce sales represented 9.8 of our consolidated net sales; 

Consolidated comparable sales for the fiscal year increased 0.3 compared to the prior fiscal year; 

Consolidated gross profit decreased by 7.8 million, or 0.4 , to 1,890.3 million. Gross margin was unchanged at 50.9 compared to the prior fiscal year; 

Consolidated operating earnings for the fiscal year decreased 42.3 million, or 13.0 , to 282.7 million. Operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 7.6 compared to the prior fiscal year; 

Consolidated net earnings for the fiscal year decreased 31.2 million, or 16.9 , to 153.4 million;

Trends Impacting Our Business 
 Recent global inflationary pressures have slowed from the highs experienced in the past few years, but they continue to influence consumer and stylist shopping behavior as well as the cost for products and services. While inflation eased, our customers have inflation fatigue and remain price sensitive. Inflationary pressures have also impacted wages, especially among retail and hourly employees, as we have experienced an increase in our labor costs in order to attract and retain associates Within our SBS business, we adapted our promotional strategy to be more focused on the promotions that matter to the customer, and we saw improvements in customer frequency. Within our BSG business, we saw our stylists respond to big promotional events, but also to newness and innovation in the assortment. 
 We continue to monitor inflationary challenges and implement measures to help mitigate their impacts, including managing our inventory levels to reduce out-of-stock items, adjusting our promotional activities, optimizing our store base and expanding our partnerships with delivery service providers, including with DoorDash and Instacart marketplaces. Although these initiatives have helped mitigate ongoing macro-headwinds, we cannot reasonably predict the long-term effects of inflation. 
 Comparable Sales 
 We believe that comparable sales is an appropriate performance indicator to measure our sales growth compared to the prior period. Our comparable sales include sales from stores that have been operating for 14 months or longer as of the last day of a month and from e-commerce revenue. Additionally, comparable sales include sales to franchisees and full-service sales. Our comparable sales amounts exclude the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and sales from stores relocated until 14 months after the relocation. Revenue from acquired stores is excluded from our comparable sales calculation until 14 months after the acquisition. Our calculation of comparable sales might not be the same as other retailers, as the calculation varies across the retail industry.

The Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024, compared to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Sales 
 SBS . The decrease in net sales for SBS was primarily driven by the following (in thousands): 

Comparable sales 

(14,084) 

Sales outside comparable sales (a) 

(28,511) 

Foreign currency exchange 

10,478 

Total 

(32,117) 

(a) Includes closed stores, including stores closed under the Plan, net of stores opened for less than 14 months. 

SBS's net sales decrease was primarily driven by lower comparable sales and the impact of store closures pursuant to the Plan. Comparable sales decreased 23.8 million resulting from store closures under the Plan; however, a significant portion of those lost sales were recaptured at other SBS locations. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. SBS s comparable sales decline was a result of fewer transactions, partially offset by growth in our average unit retail, driven by inflationary impacts and pricing leverage. 
 BSG . The increase in net sales for BSG was driven by the following (in thousands): 

Comparable sales 

25,788 

Sales outside comparable sales (a) 

(3,557) 

Foreign currency exchange 

(1,214) 

Total 

21,017 

(a) Includes closed stores, including stores closed under the Plan, net of stores opened (or acquired) for less than 14 months. 

BSG's net sales increase was primarily driven by an increase in comparable sales, reflecting expanded distribution, new brand innovation and improving salon demand trends, partially offset by the impact of store closures and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Gross Profit 
 SBS . SBS s gross profit decrease was driven by lower net sales, partially offset by a higher gross margin. SBS s gross margin improvement was primarily due to lower distribution and freight costs from supply chain efficiencies and higher product margins, partially offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption. 
 BSG . BSG s gross profit decreased slightly as a result of lower gross margin, partially offset by higher net sales. BSG's gross margin decline was driven primarily by lower product margins and favorable adjustments to our expected obsolescence reserve related to the Plan in the prior year. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SBS . SBS s SG A expenses increased 16.4 million, or 1.8 , to 923.6 million for fiscal year 2024, which includes the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 3.8 million due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to currencies in our foreign operations. As a percentage of SBS net sales, SG A for fiscal year 2024 was 43.8 compared to 42.4 for fiscal year 2023. This increase as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher labor and other compensation-related expenses, rent expense, depreciation expense and advertising expense. 
 BSG . BSG s SG A expenses increased 2.8 million, or 0.6 , to 454.0 million for fiscal year 2024 and includes a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 2.5 million. As a percentage of BSG net sales, SG A for fiscal year 2024 was 28.2 compared to 28.4 for fiscal year 2023. This decrease was driven primarily by higher net sales and lower delivery expense. 
 Unallocated. Unallocated SG A expenses, which represent certain corporate costs that have not been charged to our reporting segments, increased 32.6 million, or 16.5 , to 230.1 million, primarily due to expenses in connection with our Fuel for Growth initiative in the current year. 
 - 31 - 

Restructuring 
 The decrease in restructuring expenses was primarily due to the lapping of expenses that were incurred in connection with the Plan in the prior year totaling 17.2 million. See Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on our restructuring plans. 
 Interest Expense 
 The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the impacts of higher interest rates and debt extinguishment costs, partially offset by lower average outstanding borrowings on our ABL facility during the current year. Additionally, our interest rate swap helped mitigate some of the impacts from higher interest rates on a portion of our term loan B. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 For fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our effective tax rate was 25.6 and 26.8 , respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to additional taxes and interest recorded in the prior fiscal year in connection with the one-time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings ("Repatriation Tax") related to fiscal year 2018. See Note 15, Income Taxes , for more information on our effective tax rate. 
 Our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly and/or annual basis due to various factors, including, but not limited to, total earnings and the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, new tax laws, as well as changes in valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our ABL facility. A substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from funding the costs of our operations, working capital, capital expenditures and debt-servicing. Additionally, under our share repurchase program (see below for more details) we will from time-to-time repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market to return value to our shareholders. At September 30, 2024, we had 590.5 million in our liquidity pool, which includes amounts available for borrowings under our ABL facility of 482.5 million and cash and cash equivalents of 108.0 million. Based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth, we anticipate existing cash balances (excluding certain amounts permanently invested in connection with foreign operations), as well as cash expected to be generated by operations and funds available under the ABL facility, will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, potential acquisitions, anticipated capital expenditures (including information technology investments and store projects) and service our debt obligations over the next 12 months and beyond. 
 Our working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased 63.9 million to 712.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 648.7 million at September 30, 2023. The increase in our working capital was driven by higher inventory balances, as a result of expanded distribution rights in BSG and vendor price increases, the impacts of assets held for sale, and the timing of account payables, income tax payables, and vendor receivables, included in accounts receivable, other. These impacts were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and timing of lease renewals. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.20 to 1.00 at September 30, 2024, compared to 2.12 to 1.00 at September 30, 2023. 
 Share Repurchase Programs 
 During the fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 5.1 million shares and 1.5 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a cost of 60.0 million and 15.0 million, respectively, excluding the impact of excise taxes on share repurchases. Share repurchases are funded primarily with cash from operations and, occasionally, with borrowings under the ABL facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 520.8 million of additional share repurchase authorization remaining under our Share Repurchase Program, which expires September 30, 2025.

Operating Activities 
 The slight decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2024, compared to fiscal year 2023, was primarily driven by higher inventory purchases, fewer cash receipts from customers, and the timing of vendor and manufacturing allowances, partially offset by the timing of tax and interest payments and the impact of lease contract termination and severance payments in connection with the Plan in the prior year. 
 Investing Activities 
 The increase in net cash used by investing activities for fiscal year 2024, compared to fiscal year 2023, was primarily due to higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower cash used for acquisitions. During fiscal year 2024, we had total capital expenditures of approximately 94.7 million, excluding amounts paid in connection with the prior year, primarily in connection with investments in technology and store leasehold improvements. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used by financing activities increased as a result of increased shares repurchased under our share repurchase program and higher costs related to the issuance of debt compared to the prior year. 
 Debt and Guarantor Financial Information 
 During the current fiscal year, we issued 600.0 million in 2032 Senior Notes and used the proceeds, together with cash on hand and borrowings under our ABL facility, to redeem in full our 2025 Senior Notes. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 994.0 million in outstanding debt, excluding finance lease obligations, unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, in the aggregate, of 8.7 million. Our debt consists of 600.0 million in 2032 Senior Notes outstanding and 394.0 million remaining on our term loan B. At September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under our ABL facility. We utilize our ABL facility for the issuance of letters of credit, certain working capital and liquidity needs, and to manage normal fluctuations in our operational cash flow. In that regard, we may from time to time draw funds under the ABL facility for general corporate purposes, including funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt servicing and, occasionally, share repurchases. Amounts drawn on our ABL facility are generally paid down with cash provided by our operating activities. During fiscal year 2024, the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings under the ABL facility was 7.25 . 
 We are currently in compliance with the agreements and instruments governing our debt, including our financial covenants. 
 See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 contained in this Annual Report for additional information about our debt. 
 Guarantor Financial Information 
 Our 2032 Senior Notes were issued by our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Sally Holdings LLC and Sally Capital Inc. (the Issuers ). The notes are unsecured debt instruments guaranteed by us and certain of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (together, the Guarantors and have certain restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to make certain restrictive payments to Sally Beauty. The guarantees are joint and several, and full and unconditional. Certain other subsidiaries, including our foreign subsidiaries, do not serve as guarantors.

(b) The amounts reported for operating leases do not include common area maintenance (CAM), property taxes or other executory costs. The amounts shown above do not include immaterial contingent liabilities for operating leases for which we are liable in the event of default by a franchisee. 

(c) Purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements that are entered into by us to purchase goods or services, that specify minimum quantities to be purchased and with fixed or variable price provisions. Amounts shown do not reflect open purchase orders, mainly for merchandise, to be fulfilled within one year, which are generally cancellable or contracts that tend to be reoccurring in nature and similar in amount year over year. 

(d) Other long-term obligations, including current portion, principally represent obligations under our insurance and self-insurance programs. These obligations are included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets. 

(e) The table above does not include an estimated 8.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the realization and timing of the related future cash flows, if any. 

- 34 - 

The information contained in the table above with regards to our long-term debt obligations is based on the current terms of such debt obligations and does not reflect any assumptions about our ability or intent to refinance any of our debt either on or before their maturity. In the event we refinance some or all of the debt either on or before maturity, actual payments for some of the periods shown may differ materially from the amounts reported herein. In addition, other future events, including potential increases in interest rates, could cause actual payments to differ materially from these amounts. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 
 At September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than obligations under letters of credit, as discussed above. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosures. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used, which could have a material impact on financial statements. We believe the following are our most critical accounting estimates that require subjective judgments, estimates and assumptions: 
 Vendor Rebates and Concessions 
 We deem cash consideration received from a vendor to be a reduction of the cost of goods sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service, or a reimbursement of a specific, incremental, identifiable cost incurred by us in selling the vendor s products. The majority of cash consideration we receive is considered to be a reduction of the cost of inventory and a subsequent reduction in cost of goods sold as the related products are sold. We consider the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors in order to determine the appropriate classification of amounts received in our consolidated statements of earnings. We record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in accounts receivables, other when earned and at the amount we believe will be collected. These receivables could be significantly affected if the actual amounts subsequently collected differ from our expectations. Historically, adjustments between the amount recorded and the amount collected have not had a material impact on our results of operations. 
 Income Taxes 
 We record income tax provisions in our consolidated financial statements based on an estimate of current income tax liabilities. The development of these provisions requires judgments about tax positions, potential outcomes and timing. If we prevail in tax matters for which provisions have been established or are required to settle matters in excess of established provisions, our effective tax rate for a particular period could be significantly affected. 
 Additionally, deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between our financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are estimated to be recovered or settled. We believe it is more-likely-than-not that our results of operations in the future will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance currently recorded. We have recorded a valuation allowance to account for uncertainties regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, primarily foreign loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In the future, if we determine certain deferred tax assets will not be realizable, the related adjustments could significantly affect our effective tax rate at that time. An estimated tax benefit related to an uncertain tax position is recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge, if any, from applicable taxing authorities. 
 Assessment of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment and Restructuring 
 We review long-lived assets, including operating lease assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Long-lived assets are reviewed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which typically is at the store level. In assessing for impairment, we determine the fair value of each individual store by discounting projected future cash flows. There are certain estimates and assumptions used to arrive at estimated future cash flows, including projected earnings and growth rates. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired 
 - 35 - 

when the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows from the asset or asset group. The impairment loss recognized is the excess of the carrying value of the asset or asset group over its fair value. 
 When we commit to an exit plan of scale that we believe will result in the disposal of long-lived assets prior to the end of their useful lives, the approval of such plan may be considered a triggering event and therefore require a reassessment of asset carrying values for recoverability, based on projected cash flows. If the carrying values are not recoverable, write-downs or impairment charges may be required to bring carrying values of certain long-lived assets, including operating lease asset, to fair value. In connection with facility and store closures, we typically will also incur charges for employee severance, disposal costs and other expenses incurred with closures. These charges are accrued and estimated based on facts and circumstances at the time. Actual cash flows and expected payments could be significantly different from our estimates. 
 For fiscal years 2024 and 2023, no material impairment losses were recognized. For fiscal year 2022, we recognized an impairment loss of 24.8 million within restructuring in connection with the Plan. 
 Assessment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets for Impairment 
 We review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually, or when events or circumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-not that the value of the asset may be impaired. In assessing these types of assets for impairment, there are significant estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair value, including relevant market and economic conditions, anticipated future revenues and cash flows, royalty rates and discount rates. 
 When assessing goodwill for impairment, we may perform a qualitative assessment which evaluates macro-economic conditions, current and projected cash flows, and other events or changes in circumstances to determine if a quantitative assessment is necessary. During quantitative assessment, we use a discounted cash flow model to determine an estimated fair value. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge will be recorded to bring the carrying value down to its fair value. 
 During fiscal year 2024, we determined that no triggering events had occurred, as both internal and external facts and circumstances, including revenues in fiscal year 2024 versus prior projections and prior weighted-average cost of capital, continued to see improvement from the end of September 2023. At the end of September 2023, we determined that a triggering event had occurred, due to the decline in the Company's share price and market capitalization at the end of fiscal year 2023, among other factors. As a result, we conducted a quantitative assessment at September 30, 2023 and determined that no impairment existed for our SBS or BSG reporting units. 
 Like goodwill, our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each asset to its carrying value, but only if a triggering event exists. As of September 30, 2024, our indefinite-lived assets were comprised of only trade names. To determine the fair value of each trade name, we use the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates what a third-party would be willing to pay in royalties to receive a benefit from the use of the asset. If it is determined the asset s fair value is less than its carrying value, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value down to its fair value. No impairment losses were recognized in fiscal years 2024, 2023, or 2022.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 As a multinational corporation, we are subject to certain market risks, including risks resulting from our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, changes in interest rates and government actions. We consider a variety of practices to manage these market risks, including, when deemed appropriate, the use of derivative financial instruments. Currently, we do not purchase or hold, and are restricted by our debt and credit agreements from engaging in, any derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. 
 - 36 - 

Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
 We are exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments in subsidiaries (including intercompany balances not permanently invested) and earnings denominated in foreign currencies as well as exposure resulting from the purchase of merchandise by certain of our subsidiaries in a currency other than their functional currency and from the sale of products and services among the parent company and subsidiaries with a functional currency different from the parent or among subsidiaries with different functional currencies. Our primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso. In addition, we currently have exposure to the currencies of certain countries located in South America and from time to time we may have exposure to changes in the exchange rate for the British pound sterling versus the Euro in connection with the sale of products and services among certain of our European subsidiaries. For each of the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, less than 20 of our consolidated net sales were made in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
 A 10 increase or decrease in the exchange rates for the U.S. dollar versus the foreign currencies to which we have exposure would have impacted our consolidated net sales by approximately 1.8 in the fiscal year 2024, and it would have impacted our consolidated net assets by approximately 2.2 at September 30, 2024. 
 As more fully discussed in Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, we use, from time to time, foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest rate risk 
 We are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations as a result of borrowings under our ABL facility and term loan B. At September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the ABL facility, and the term loan B had 394.0 million in outstanding principal balance. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we held 200 million of SOFR denominated interest hedged under an interest rate swap agreement to help mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk. At September 30, 2024, a 1.0 percentage point interest rate increase would negatively impact our annual interest expense and cash flows by 1.9 million. 
 As more fully discussed in Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, we use, from time to time, derivative instruments in order to manage risk relating to cash flows and interest rate exposure. 
 Credit risk 
 We are exposed to credit risk in connection with certain assets, primarily accounts receivable. We provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. We believe our exposure of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by our broad customer base and that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks at September 30, 2024. 
 Our derivative instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty. We believe such exposure is mitigated by the substantial resources and strong creditworthiness of the counterparties to our derivative instruments at September 30, 2024. In the event a counterparty defaults in its obligation under our derivative instruments, we could incur substantial financial losses. However, at the present time, no such losses are deemed probable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROL S AND PROCEDURES 
 Background. Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are certifications of our CEO and our CFO, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. This Controls and Procedures section includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications. Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K sets forth the attestation report of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, regarding its audit of our internal control over financial reporting. This section should be read in conjunction with the certifications and the KPMG attestation report for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. 
 Controls Evaluation and Related CEO and CFO Certifications. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. The controls evaluation was conducted by our Disclosure Committee, comprised of senior representatives from our finance, accounting, IT security, internal audit and legal departments under the supervision of our CEO and CFO. 
 Certifications of our CEO and our CFO, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, are attached as exhibits to this Annual Report. This Controls and Procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. We do not expect our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A system of controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Because of the limitations in all such systems, no evaluation can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Furthermore, the design of any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how unlikely. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective system of controls and procedures, misstatements or omissions due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. 
 Scope of the Controls Evaluation. The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of their objectives and design, our implementation of the controls and procedures and the effect of the controls and procedures on the information generated for use in this Annual Report. In the course of the evaluation, we sought to identify whether we had any data errors, control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm appropriate corrective action, including process improvements, was being undertaken if needed. This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so conclusions concerning the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures can be reported in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Reports on Form 10-K. Many of the components of our disclosure controls and procedures are also evaluated by our internal audit department, by our legal department and by personnel in our finance organization. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to maintain them as dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. 
 Conclusions regarding Disclosure Controls. Based on the required evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 Management of the Company, including the CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and our Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. A system of internal controls may become inadequate over time because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with 
 - 38 - 

the policies or procedures. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles based on such criteria. 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm . Please refer to KPMG s Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting on page F-1 of the financial statements, which begin on page 48 of this Annual Report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During our last fiscal quarter, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.: 
 Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 F- 1 

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 	Evaluation of vendor rebates and concessions 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, accounts receivable, other, consists primarily of amounts due from the Company s vendors under contractual agreements (collectively referred to as vendor rebates and concessions). These agreements are often specific to a particular product or promotion for a specified period of time, which results in a high volume of agreements, each with potentially non-standardized terms and conditions governing how the rebate is earned and calculated. Therefore, the inputs used to calculate the vendor rebates and concessions, which can include financial and non-financial data from multiple sources, will vary depending on the specific terms of the agreements. Accounts receivable, other was 58.6 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 We identified the evaluation of vendor rebates and concessions as a critical audit matter because of the challenging auditor judgment required to assess the non-standardized terms of the agreements and the nature and source of the inputs used in the recognition and measurement of the receivable. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s process to calculate vendor rebates and concessions. This included controls over the derivation of key inputs and the evaluation of the contractual terms of the agreements. For a sample of the vendor rebates and concessions, we evaluated the nature and source of the inputs used, and the terms of the contractual agreements. We recalculated the amount of the receivable based on the inputs and the terms of the agreements. We also confirmed outstanding vendor receivables directly with the Company s vendors and compared the confirmed amount to the amount previously recognized by the Company for a sample of vendor rebates and concessions. 
 /s/ 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2006.

. Some of our leases include options to extend the agreement by a certain number of years, typically . At the lease commencement date, an operating lease liability and related operating lease asset are recognized and typically do not assume renewals unless we are reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. The operating lease liabilities are calculated using the present value of lease payments. The discount rate used is either the rate implicit in the lease, when known, or our estimated incremental borrowing rate. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. Because we do not generally borrow on a collateralized basis, we derive an appropriate incremental borrowing rate using the interest rate we pay on our non-collateralized borrowings, adjusted for the amount of the lease payments, the lease term and the effect of designating specific collateral with a value equal to the unpaid lease payments for that lease. We apply the incremental borrowing rate on a portfolio basis given the impact of applying it on a lease by lease basis would be immaterial. Operating lease assets are valued based on the initial operating lease liabilities plus any prepaid rent and direct costs from executing the leases, reduced by tenant improvement allowances and any rent abatement. Operating lease assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as our long-lived assets. material impairment losses were recorded during fiscal years 2024 or 2023. For fiscal year 2022, we recognized impairment loss in connection with our operating leases assets of million in connection with the Plan and are included within restructuring on our consolidated statements of earnings. Please see Note 17, Restructuring , for more information on the Plan.

 million shares of our common stock, plus an additional number of shares based on the number of shares outstanding as of the beginning of the current plan that have subsequently been terminated, expired unexercised, cash-settled, cancelled, forfeited or lapsed for any reason. Currently, we have awarded grants to employees and non-employee directors under the terms of the Omnibus Plan. 

Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense 

The Omnibus Plan award types are as follows: Performance-based awards: Our performance awards vest over upon the satisfaction of the employee service condition and our level of achievement with respect to a mix of certain specified performance targets. For fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, we issued performance awards with a financial performance target based on the growth on adjusted consolidated operating income AOI for each of the next three years. For each performance award, a grantee may earn from to of the original awarded amount. Fair value of our performance awards related to the achievement of financial performance targets are based on our stock price on the date of grant. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 , the fair value of our performance awards was , and , respectively. Expense is determined upon issuance and recognized based on projections of future performance and actual results. Market-based awards: In fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 , we issued market-based awards that vest over and are dependent on the level of achievement of relative total shareholder return rTSR against a group of peer companies measured over a period. For each rTSR, a grantee may earn from to of the original awarded amount. The fair value was determined by using the Monte Carlo simulation model due to the award being subject to a market condition. During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 , the fair value of our market-based awards was , and , respectively. Expense is determined upon issuance and is recognized regardless of whether the market performance target is achieved. Stock options: Stock option awards are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant and expense ratably over the vesting period, generally . Stock options have a life. Restricted stock: Restricted stock awards RSA and restricted stock units RSU are valued using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period, generally for RSAs and RSUs issued to employees and for RSUs issued to our independent directors. An RSA award is an award of our shares that have full voting rights and dividend rights but are restricted with regard to sale or transfer. These restrictions lapse over the vesting period. RSUs are awarded to our independent directors who may elect, upon receipt of such award, to defer until a later date delivery of the shares of our common stock that would otherwise be issued on the vesting date. RSUs granted to independent directors prior to the fiscal year 2012, are generally retained by the Company as deferred stock units that are not distributed until after the independent director s service as a director terminates.

The TLB 2030 bears interest at a floating rate equal to, at our option, either the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus or an adjusted base rate plus , see below for additional information. Interest on the TLB 2030 is payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year. (the Maturity Date ), but may be prepaid without penalty or premium, other than customary breakage costs for prepayments that are made prior to the last date of an interest period. The principal of the TLB 2030 is of the original principal amount of the TLB 2030, with a final installment equal to the entire remaining outstanding principal amount due on the Maturity Date. The TLB 2030 was issued at a discount of , and we incurred million in issuance costs; both of which are being amortized using the effective interest method based on the effective interest rates at the time of issuance. The TLB 2030 is secured by a first-priority lien in and upon substantially all of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries other than the accounts, inventory (and the proceeds thereof) and other assets that secure Sally Holdings existing ABL facility on a first-priority basis (the ABL Priority Collateral ). Additionally, the TLB 2030 is secured by a second-priority lien in and upon the ABL Priority Collateral. The TLB 2030 does not contain any financial maintenance covenants, but is subject to a covenant package that is substantially consistent with the covenant package governing our senior notes. The TLB 2030 is subject to customary asset sale mandatory prepayment provisions and excess cash flow mandatory prepayment provisions. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we entered into second and first refinancing agreements, respectively, where we negotiated basis point reductions of and basis points, respectively.

 million and million in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, within interest expense. In connection with the repricing, we incurred additional immaterial costs, of which, the majority was recorded to interest expense. Furthermore, the extinguishment of debt and subsequent issuance of new debt with existing creditors resulted in non-cash financing activities of million and million for fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively. Senior Notes On February 27, 2024, we issued a public offering of senior notes due 2032 ("2032 Senior Notes") pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on May 10, 2021. As a result, we received million in cash proceeds, net of underwriter fees, which were used towards the repayment of the outstanding million principal balance on the senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes ). The 2032 Senior Notes were issued at par and bear interest at a fixed interest rate of . . , at a price of after March 1, 2028, and at par after March 1, 2029. The 2032 Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the guarantors who have guaranteed obligations under our ABL facility and our existing term loan. In connection with the issuance, we incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs that are being amortized using the effective interest rate method through the life of the notes. Additionally, on February 12, 2024, we issued a notice to redeem the entire million aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes that remained outstanding on March 13, 2024, at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. On March 13, 2024, we redeemed the 2025 Senior Notes with the proceeds from our 2032 Senior Notes, cash on hand, and borrowings under our ABL facility. In connection with this redemption, we recognized a million loss on the extinguishment of debt within interest expense related to unamortized debt issuance costs. Covenants 

t purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 3 for the classification and fair value of our derivative instruments. Designated Cash Flow Hedges Foreign Currency Forwards During fiscal year 2024, we entered into foreign currency forwards to mitigate the exposure to exchange rate changes on inventory purchases in USD by our foreign subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, all of our foreign currency forward derivatives instruments had settled. We record, net of income tax, the changes in fair value related to the foreign currency forwards into AOCL and recognize realized gain or loss into cost of goods sold based on inventory turns. As of September 30, 2024 , we expect to reclassify approximately million in net losses into cost of goods sold over the next 12 months. During fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022 , we reclassified a net loss of million, a net loss of million and a net gain of million, respectively, into cost of goods sold. Interest Rate Swap In April 2023, we entered into a three-year interest rate swap with an initial notional amount of million (the interest rate swap to mitigate the exposure to higher interest rates in connection with our TLB 2030. The interest rate swap involves fixed monthly payments at the contract rate of , and in return, we will receive a floating

 million and million, respectively, into interest expense on our condensed consolidated statements of earnings related to the interest rate swap. At September 30, 2024, we expect to reclassify gains of approximately million out of AOCL and into interest expense over the next 12 months. Interest Rate Caps In July 2017, we purchased interest rate caps with an initial aggregate notional amount of million (the interest rate caps to mitigate the exposure to higher interest rates in connection with our prior term loan due 2024. The interest rate caps were comprised of individual caplets and were designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the changes in fair value of the interest rate caps were recorded quarterly, net of income tax, and included in AOCL. During fiscal year 2023, we early settled both interest rate caps due to the forecasted transactions, which were being hedged, no longer occurring as a result of the repayment of our prior term loan. For fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we recognized income of million and expense of million, respectively, into interest expense on our condensed consolidated statements of earnings related to the caps. Non-Designated Cash Flow Hedges We also use foreign exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes in connection with certain intercompany balances not permanently invested.

 , we acquired certain assets and business operations from Exclusive Beauty Supply, Inc. ("Exclusive Beauty"), a distributor of professional beauty products operating in the State of Florida, for approximately million, subject to certain holdback adjustments related to inventory. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired the operations of stores and a direct sales force, inventory, and non-exclusive product distribution rights. As part of BSG's growth strategies, this acquisition complements its existing lines of business and increases the size and geographic scope of operations. This acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and funded with cash from operations. As of September 30, 2024, the purchase price of the acquisition has been allocated to all assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Based on our fair value estimates, we recorded million in intangible assets subject to amortization, million for inventory (preliminary), and million in goodwill, which has been allocated to BSG and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Subsequent to the acquisition date, all operating results were included in BSG and were not material to the consolidated results of operations. Pro forma information has not been provided as the effects were not material to our consolidated results of operations.

We believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance. During fiscal year 2024, existing valuation allowances were decreased by approximately million, primarily for net operating loss carry-forwards of various members of the affiliated group in foreign jurisdictions and foreign tax credits. We continue to record a valuation allowance to account for uncertainties regarding recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, primarily foreign loss carry-forwards and tax credit carry-forwards. Domestic earnings before provision for income taxes were million, million and million in the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. Foreign earnings before provision for income taxes of million, million and million in the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Tax reserves are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate, while taking into account the progress of audits by various taxing jurisdictions and other changes in relevant facts and circumstances evident at each balance sheet date. We do not expect the outcome of current or future tax audits to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Applicable deferred tax liabilities have been provided for undistributed foreign earnings in excess of foreign working capital and cash requirements. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform, the repatriation of cash to the U.S. is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes but could be subject to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes. If undistributed earnings of our foreign operations were not considered permanently reinvested as of September 30, 2024, an immaterial amount of additional deferred taxes would have been provided.

 million and million, respectively, of which million and million, respectively, are subject to a valuation allowance. At September 30, 2024 , operating loss carry-forwards of million have no expiration date. At September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we had tax credit carry-forwards of million and million, respectively. This includes a U.S. foreign tax credit carry-forward of million, primarily as a result of the deemed repatriation tax under U.S. Tax Reform. This credit expires in 2028. We do not believe the realization of the U.S. foreign tax credit is more-likely-than-not, so a valuation allowance has been recorded against its full value. Of the remaining tax credit carry-forwards, at September 30, 2024 , million expire between 2025 and 2029, million expire between 2033 and 2037 and million have no expiration date.

If recognized, these positions would affect our effective tax rate. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA enacted comprehensive amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Among other things, TCJA provided for a deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings by U.S. taxpayers giving rise to a one-time transition tax on those earnings Repatriation Tax ). The U.S. Treasury Department issued final regulations Regulations addressing certain aspects of how the Repatriation Tax is calculated. In our view, certain guidance included in the Regulations is inconsistent with our interpretation of the statutory language contained in the TCJA. In fiscal year 2023, we remitted million in tax and interest to the IRS. Income tax expense of million was recorded in fiscal year 2023 related to the payments. Previously, million had been reserved for this issue. We maintain our tax positions are fully supportable. We recognize interest and penalties, accrued in connection with unrecognized tax benefits, in provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties, in the aggregate, were million and million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Because existing tax positions will continue to generate increased liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months, and the fact that from time to time our tax returns are routinely under audit by various taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months. An estimate of the amount of such change, or a range thereof, cannot reasonably be made at this time. However, we do not expect the change, if any, to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations within the next 12 months. Our consolidated federal income tax return for the fiscal years 2022 and 2023 are currently under IRS examination. Our statute remains open for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, forward. Our U.S. state income tax returns are impacted by various statutes of limitations and are generally open for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and future years. Our foreign income tax returns are impacted by various statutes of limitations, which are generally open from 2019 forward. In December of 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) established a framework, referred to as Pillar 2, designed to ensure large multinational enterprises pay a minimum percent level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction in which they operate. The earliest effective date is for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2023, which for us is fiscal year 2025. Numerous countries have already enacted the OECD model rules, and several other countries have drafted legislation. We do not expect this legislation to have a

(a) Amounts related to the Plan included favorable adjustments to our expected obsolescence reserve within costs of goods sold and costs associated with the closure of stores and distribution centers during the period . 

Distribution Center Consolidation and Store Optimization Plan In fiscal year 2022, our Board approved the Plan consisting of the planned closure of 330 SBS stores and 35 BSG stores and two BSG distribution centers in Clackamas, Oregon and Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Stores identified for early closure were part of a strategic evaluation which included a market analysis of certain locations where we believed we would be able to recapture demand and improve profitability. As of September 30, 2024, the Plan has been substantially completed, as the only two remaining BSG stores to be closed were closed during the fiscal year. However, we may still incur future immaterial charges related to store closures such as exit costs, lease negotiation penalties, termination benefits and adjustments to estimates. As of September 30, 2024, there were no material outstanding liabilities for exit costs or involuntary employee termination benefits. In fiscal year 2023, we closed 294 SBS stores and 26 BSG stores, as well as the two BSG distribution centers. In fiscal year 2022, we closed 36 SBS stores and 7 BSG stores. Transformation Plan We previously disclosed a plan to focus on certain core business strategies. In addition to optimizing our supply chain network with changes to our transportation model and network of nodes, we improved our marketing and digital commerce capabilities and advanced our merchandising transformation efforts. In addition, we expanded our plan and announced a reduction in workforce within our field and headquarters. Furthermore, our Board approved the divestiture of our operations in Peru, which was not material to our results of operation. All these together made up our Transformation Plan. We did not incur any additional expenses or liabilities related to our Transformation Plan in fiscal years 2024 or 2023. 

, we sold our corporate headquarters located in Denton, Texas to Denton County, Texas for million, excluding million in closing costs. As of September 30, 2024, the assets included in the sale were classified as held for sale within other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the sale, we recognized a gain of approximately million from the sale of these assets during our first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Additionally, we entered into a lease agreement with Denton County, Texas, to lease the building for per month for , with the option to extend three additional months. At this time, we do not anticipate exercising this option.

 INSIDER TRADING POLICY

EX-19 

Exhibit 19 
 SALLY BEAUTY HOLDINGS, INC. INSIDER TRADING POLICY STATEMENT 
 1. The Need For a Policy Statement 

Federal and state securities laws prohibit the purchase or sale of a company s securities by persons who are aware of material information about that company that is not generally known or available to the public. These laws also prohibit persons who are aware of such material non-public information from disclosing this information to others who may trade. Companies and their controlling persons also are subject to liability if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading by company personnel. 
 
 The Company has adopted this policy statement both to satisfy the Company's obligation to prevent insider trading by all Company personnel and to help Company personnel avoid the severe consequences associated with violations of the insider trading laws. The policy statement also is intended to prevent even the appearance of improper conduct on the part of anyone employed by or associated with the Company. We have all worked hard over the years to establish a reputation for integrity and ethical conduct, and we cannot afford to have that reputation damaged. It is your personal obligation to understand and comply with this policy statement. 
 
 This policy statement also applies to your family members who reside with you, anyone else who lives in your household and any family members who do not live in your household but whose transactions in Company securities are directed by you or are subject to your influence or control (such as parents or children who consult with you before they trade in Company securities). By law, you are responsible for the transactions of these other persons, and therefore should make them aware of the need to confer with you before they trade in the Company s securities. 
 
 References in this policy statement to the Company include any subsidiary of the Company, and references to employees include part-time and temporary employees of the Company as well as consultants and other independent contractors of the Company. 
 
 2. The Consequences of Noncompliance 

Both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange investigate and are very effective at detecting insider trading. The SEC, together with the U.S. Attorneys, pursues insider-trading violations vigorously. Cases have been successfully prosecuted against trading by employees through foreign accounts, trading by family members and friends and trading involving only a small number of shares. 
 
 The consequences of an insider trading violation can be severe in several different types of circumstances: 
 Traders and Tippers . Company personnel who trade on inside information are subject to the following penalties: 
 
 Disgorgement of profits; 

A civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided; 

A criminal fine of up to 5,000,000 (no matter how small the profit); and/or 

A jail term of up to 20 years. 

In addition, a director, officer or other employee who passes along, or tips, information to a person who then trades is subject to the same penalties as the tippee, even if the tipper did not trade and did not profit from the tippee's trading. 
 
 1 

Control Persons . The Company and its directors, officers and other supervisory personnel, if they fail to take appropriate steps to prevent illegal insider trading, are subject to the following penalties: 
 
 A civil penalty of up to 1,000,000 or, if greater, three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the employee's violation; and/or 

A criminal penalty of up to 5,000,000 for individuals and up to 25,000,000 for the Company. 

Company-Imposed Sanctions . The failure of a director, officer or other employee to comply with the Company's insider trading policy may subject him or her to Company-imposed sanctions under the Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, up to and including dismissal for cause, whether or not the failure to comply results in a violation of law. A violation of law, or even an SEC or stock exchange investigation that does not result in prosecution, can tarnish one's reputation and irreparably damage a career. 
 
 3. Our Policy 

a. Trading on Material Non-Public Information Prohibited. It is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or other employee of the Company who is aware of material non-public information relating to the Company may, directly or indirectly through family members or other persons or entities: 

buy or sell securities of the Company (other than pursuant to a pre-approved trading plan that complies with SEC Rule 10b5-1) or engage in any other action to take personal advantage of that information, or 

except as expressly authorized under our disclosure procedures, pass that information on, or recommend the purchase or sale of Company securities based on that information, to others outside the Company, including family and friends. 

In addition, it is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or other employee of the Company who, in the course of working for the Company, learns of material non-public information about another company (such as a supplier of the Company or a company with which the Company may be negotiating a major transaction such as an acquisition, investment or sale) may trade in that company's securities or tip the information to others until the information becomes public or is no longer material. Information that is not material to the Company may nevertheless be material to one of those other companies. 
 
 Unless you have been provided guidance to the contrary from the Legal Department, you may not trade while you are aware of material non-public information even if you believe that the information has not influenced your trading decision in other words, even if you would have traded without having the information. The securities laws do not make this distinction, and neither can the Company. 
 
 Transactions that may appear justifiable due to the existence of a personal financial emergency (such as the need to raise money for an expenditure) are not exempt from the policy. The securities laws do not recognize such mitigating circumstances, and in any event, even the appearance of an improper transaction must be avoided to preserve the Company's reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct. 
 
 Before engaging in any transaction, you should carefully consider how enforcement authorities and others might view the transaction in hindsight. 
 
 b. Definition of Material Non-public Information. Material inside information has two important elements materiality and public availability. 

Material Information . Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making a decision to buy, hold or sell a security. Any information that could reasonably be expected to affect the Company's stock price, whether it is positive or negative, should be considered material. Some examples of information that ordinarily would be regarded as material are: 
 
 Projections of short term future earnings or losses or other earnings guidance; 

Changes in previously released earnings estimates or guidance; 

Earnings that are inconsistent with the consensus expectations of the investment community; 

A pending or proposed merger, acquisition, tender offer or acquisition or disposition of significant assets; 

2 

The development or acquisition of a significant new product or product line; 

The gain or loss of a significant contract, order, or supplier; 

Actual or threatened major litigation, or the resolution of such litigation; 

Significant regulatory or legislative developments affecting the Company; 

A change in or other development regarding senior management; 

A change in dividend policy or the declaration of a stock split; 

An offering of additional securities; and 

The existence of financial liquidity problems or impending bankruptcy. 

When Information is Public. A common misperception is that material information loses its non-public status as soon as a press release is issued disclosing the information. In fact, information is considered to be available to the public only after it has been released broadly to the marketplace (such as by press release, webcast conference or an SEC filing) and the investing public has had time to absorb the information fully . To avoid the appearance of impropriety, as a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed by the marketplace until after the second full trading day after the information is released. If, for example, the Company were to make an announcement on a Thursday after trading closes, you should not trade in the Company's securities until Tuesday. If an announcement were made on a Monday before trading begins, Wednesday generally would be the first eligible day on which you could trade in the Company s securities. 
 
 c. Unauthorized Disclosure. 

Confidentiality . You should treat all information that you receive about the Company or its relationships with third parties as confidential and proprietary to the Company. Inadvertent disclosure of confidential or inside information may expose the Company and you to significant risks of investigation and litigation. No director, officer or other employee of the company should disclose non-public information to anyone (even substantial numbers of employees), except other personnel of the Company who need to know the information to perform their duties. 
 
 External Communications . All external communications about the Company must be made through designated company spokespersons authorized to speak for the Company. Unless you are expressly authorized to do so in the performance of your duties, you should not discuss internal matters concerning the Company with anyone outside of the Company. This prohibition applies specifically (but not exclusively) to inquiries from the press and members of the financial community. If you receive any inquiries of this nature, you should decline comment and refer the inquiry to Corporate Communications or to Investor Relations. 
 
 Please note that it is inappropriate for any unauthorized person to disclose Company information on the Internet, including in investment-oriented forums (chat rooms) where companies and their prospects are discussed. The posts in these forums are often made by persons who may be poorly informed or, in some cases, malicious or manipulative and who intend to benefit their own stock positions. Accordingly, no director, officer, other employee or other party related to the Company may discuss the Company or Company-related information in such a forum regardless of the situation. Posts in these forums can result in the disclosure of material non-public information and may bring significant legal and financial risk to the Company and are therefore prohibited. You should also not disclose information about the Company on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. 
 
 d. Transactions Under Company Plans. 

Stock Incentive or Option Plans . The insider trading policy statement does not apply to the exercise of a stock option or to the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares subject to an option or a stock appreciation right to satisfy tax withholding requirements. The policy does apply, however, to any sale of the underlying stock or to a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option because this entails selling a portion of the underlying stock to generate the cash needed to pay the exercise price of the option. 
 
 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plans . If the Company continues to offer its securities as an investment option in its 401(k) or profit sharing plans, the insider trading policy would not apply to purchases of Company stock in these plans resulting from your periodic contribution of money to the plan pursuant to your payroll deduction election. The policy would apply, however, to elections you may make under these plans to (a) increase or decrease your payroll deduction if you were to allocate a portion of your future contributions to the Company stock fund, (b) increase or decrease the percentage of your or the Company s contributions that would be allocated to the Company stock fund, 
 3 

(c) make an intra-plan transfer of an existing account balance into or out of the Company stock fund, (d) borrow money against your 401(k) plan account if the loan will result in a liquidation of some or all of your Company stock fund balance, and (e) pre-pay a plan loan if the pre-payment will result in allocation of loan proceeds to the Company stock fund. 
 
 e. Additional Prohibited Transactions. The Company considers it improper and inappropriate for any director, officer or other employee of the Company to engage in short-term or speculative transactions in the Company's securities. It therefore is the Company's policy that directors, officers and other employees may not engage in any of the following transactions. 

Short Sales . Short sales of the Company's securities evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value and therefore signal to the market that the seller has no confidence in the Company or its short-term prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce the seller's incentive to improve the Company's performance. For these reasons, the insider trading policy prohibits short sales of the Company s securities. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits directors and executive officers from engaging in short sales. 
 
 Publicly Traded Options . A transaction in options is, in effect, a bet on the short-term movement of the Company's stock and therefore creates the appearance that the director, officer or other employee is trading based on inside information. Transactions in options also may focus the person s attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company's long-term objectives. Accordingly, transactions in puts, calls or other derivative securities, on an exchange or in any other organized market, are prohibited by the insider trading policy. (Option positions arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by the section below captioned Hedging Transactions. 
 
 Hedging Transactions . Certain forms of hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts, allow a director, officer or other employee to lock in much of the value of his or her stock holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for upside appreciation in the stock. These transactions allow the person to continue to own the covered securities but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, he or she may no longer have the same objectives as the Company's other stockholders. Therefore, directors, officers and other employees are prohibited from engaging in any such transactions. 
 
 Margin Accounts and Pledges . Securities held in a margin account may be sold by the broker without the customer's consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Because a margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the customer or borrower is aware of material non-public information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Company securities, directors, officers and other employees are prohibited from holding Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan. An exception to this prohibition may be granted where a person wishes to pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan (not including margin debt) and clearly demonstrates the financial capacity to repay the loan without resort to the pledged securities. Any person who wishes to pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan must submit a request for approval to the Legal Department at least two weeks prior to the proposed execution of documents evidencing the proposed pledge. 
 
 Standing Orders . Standing orders placed with a broker to sell or purchase stock at a specified price should be used only for a very brief period of time. A standing order leaves the seller with no control over the timing of the transaction. A standing order transaction executed by the broker when the seller is aware of material non-public information may result in unlawful insider trading, absent a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. 
 
 f. Post-Termination Transactions. The insider trading policy continues to apply to your transactions in Company securities even after you have terminated employment. If you are in possession of material non-public information when your employment terminates, you may not trade in Company securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. 

4. Company Assistance 

Any person who has a question about this policy statement or its application to any proposed transaction may obtain additional guidance from the Company s Legal Department, at 940-297-2205. 
 
 4 

Do not try to resolve uncertainties on your own because the rules relating to insider trading are often complex, not always intuitive and carry severe consequences. 
 
 5. Using the Company s Established Broker. 

Because the interaction of our Payroll and Legal Departments in establishing the correct controls and procedures is critical to the protection of the Company and its employees, you must utilize UBS when engaging in transactions in securities held through the Company s equity plans and Empower when engaging in transactions in Company securities held through the 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan. Any open-market purchases or sales of the Company s equity securities are your sole responsibility; however we recommend the use of UBS to avoid issues under this insider trading policy statement. Please contact the Payroll Department for contact information for UBS and/or Empower. 
 
 6. Addendum 

To help prevent inadvertent violations and to avoid even the appearance of trading on the basis of inside information, the Company has adopted an Addendum to Insider Trading Policy Statement that applies to directors, executive officers subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain other designated employees who have access to material non- public information about the Company. The Company will notify you if you are subject to the Addendum. 
 
 This insider trading policy statement is effective as of April 25, 2019 and supersedes all previous policies of the Company concerning insider trading.

 3. Mandatory Recoupment Policy in the Context of Accounting Restatements 

3.1 The Company has adopted the policy set forth in this Section 3 (the Mandatory Policy in accordance with the applicable listing standards of the NYSE and Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act. In the event that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall recover reasonably promptly the amount of all Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received by a person: 

i. After beginning service as a Covered Executive; 

ii. Who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-Based Compensation; 

iii. While the Company has a listed class of securities listed on the NYSE; and 

iv. During the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare the Accounting Restatement and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years. For purposes of this Mandatory Policy, a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to twelve months would be deemed a completed fiscal year. 

3.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Mandatory Policy shall only apply to Incentive-Based Compensation Received on or after the Mandatory Policy Effective Date. 

3.3 The Company s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this Mandatory Policy is not dependent on when the restated financial statements are filed. 

3.4 For purposes of determining the relevant recovery period under this Mandatory Policy, the date that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement is the earliest to occur of: (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting 

- 3 - 

Restatement; or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 

3.5 The Company must recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Mandatory Policy except to the extent that the conditions of paragraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) in this Section 3.5 are met, and the Committee, or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board, has determined that recovery would be impracticable. 

i. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Mandatory Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the NYSE. 

ii. Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impractical to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company shall obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the NYSE, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to the NYSE. 

iii. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 

3.6 The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executive or former Covered Executive against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this Mandatory Policy. 

3.7 The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Mandatory Policy in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Federal securities laws, including the disclosure required by the applicable SEC filings. 

3.8 In addition to the Covered Executives and former Covered Executives, this Mandatory Policy shall apply to any other employee of the Company or its subsidiaries designated by the Committee or the Board as a person covered by this Mandatory Policy by written notice to the employee Other Covered Person ). 

3.8.1 Unless otherwise determined by the Committee or the Board, this Mandatory Policy shall apply to an Other Covered Person as if such individual was a Covered 

- 4 - 

Executive during the relevant periods described in Section 3. 

3.8.2 The Committee or the Board may, in its discretion, limit recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation from an Other Covered Person to situations in which an Accounting Restatement was caused or contributed to by the Other Covered Person s Misconduct. 

3.8.3 In addition, the Committee or the Board shall have discretion as to (i) whether to seek to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation from an Other Covered Person, (ii) the amount of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation to be recovered from an Other Covered Person, and (iii) the method of recovering any such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from an Other Covered Person. In exercising such discretion, the Committee or the Board may take into account such considerations as it deems appropriate, including whether the assertion of a claim may violate applicable law or prejudice the interests of the Company in any related proceeding or investigation. 

3.9 The Committee shall have full authority to interpret and enforce this Mandatory Policy to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

3.10 The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the appropriate means to seek recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which may include, without limitation: (i) requiring cash reimbursement; (ii) seeking recovery or forfeiture of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer or other disposition of any equity-based awards; (iii) offsetting the amount to be recouped from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive; (iv) canceling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; or (v) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Committee. 

3.11 The Committee shall determine the repayment schedule for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation in a manner that complies with the reasonably promptly requirement set forth in Section 3.1 hereof. Such determination shall be consistent with any applicable legal guidance, by the SEC, judicial opinion or otherwise. The determination with respect to reasonably promptly recovery may vary from case to case and the Committee is authorized to adopt additional rules to further describe what repayment schedules satisfies this requirement. 

3.12 To the extent a Covered Executive, former Covered Executive or Other Covered Person refuses to pay to the Company any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the Company shall have the right to sue for repayment or, to the extent legally permitted, to enforce such person s obligation to make payment by withholding unpaid or future compensation. 

3.13 Any determination by the Committee or the Board with respect to this Mandatory Policy shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 

3.14 If the requirement to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation is triggered under this 

- 5 - 

Mandatory Policy, then, in the event of any actual or alleged conflict between the provisions of this Mandatory Policy and a similar clause or provision in any of the Company s plans, awards, policies or agreements, this Mandatory Policy shall be controlling and determinative; provided that, if such other plan, award, policy or agreement provides that a greater amount of compensation shall be subject to clawback, the provisions of such other plan, award, policy or agreement shall apply to the amount in excess of the amount subject to clawback under this Mandatory Policy. 

4. Discretionary Recoupment Policy in the Context of Misconduct 

4.1 It is the policy of the Company that: 

4.1.1 The Company will, to the extent permitted by governing law, require reimbursement of any Incentive-Based Compensation paid to any Covered Employee or Covered Executive after January 1, 2011, and within 12 months prior to the Determination Date, where: (i) the payment was predicated upon the achievement of specified financial results; (ii) such financial results were subsequently the subject of a restatement or other material adjustment, (iii) in the Committee s view the individual Covered Employee or Covered Executive engaged in Misconduct which caused or contributed to the need for the restatement or material adjustment, and (iv) a lower payment would have been made to the Covered Employee or Covered Executive based upon the correct financial results. In each such instance, the Company will seek to recover the Covered Employee s or Covered Executive s entire Incentive-Based Compensation payment for the relevant period(s); and 

4.1.2 In the event that the Committee determines that any Covered Employee or Covered Executive engaged in Misconduct, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, require (i) the cancellation or forfeiture of the unvested portion of all of such Covered Employee s or Covered Executive s Equity Awards granted on or after September 18, 2019; and/or (ii) the Covered Employee or Covered Executive to reimburse the Company for the amount of the Covered Employee s or Covered Executive s most recently-received Incentive-Based Compensation (Section 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 collectively referred to herein as the Discretionary Policy ). 

4.2 This Section 4 shall be effective as of the Discretionary Policy Effective Date. 

5. General 

5.1 These rights to recoupment are in addition to any other rights that the Company may have against any Covered Employee or Covered Executive, including any remedies at law or in equity. Application of this Policy does not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce a Covered Employee s or Covered Executive s obligations to the Company, including termination of employment or institution of civil or criminal proceedings. Nothing in this Policy shall be viewed as limiting the right of the Company 

- 6 - 

or the Committee to pursue recoupment under or as provided by the Company s plans, awards, policies or agreements or the applicable provisions of any law, rule or regulation (including, without limitation, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

5.2 The Committee may amend this Policy, provided that any such amendment does not cause the Mandatory Policy to violate applicable listing standards of the NYSE or Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act. 

5.3 Any determination by the Committee or the Board with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. 

5.4 Nothing contained herein prohibits a Covered Employee or Covered Executive from: (1) reporting possible violations of federal law or regulations, including any possible securities laws violations, to any governmental agency or entity; (2) making any other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulations; or (3) otherwise fully participating in any federal whistleblower programs, including but not limited to any such programs managed by the SEC.
