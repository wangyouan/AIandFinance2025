 DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, all of which are based upon various estimates and assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable as of the date hereof. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, could, should, expect, plan, project, intend, anticipate, believe, seek, estimate, predict, potential, pursue, target, continue, the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company s actual future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: 
 
 a general reduction in the demand for our products or services; 
 
 changes in general economic conditions, including supply chain constraints, high rates of inflation, changes in consumer sentiment, elevated interest rates, and market disruptions resulting from a number of factors, including geo-political events such as the Ukraine-Russia war, the conflict in the Middle East, and trade tensions between the U.S. and China; 
 
 competition in the industries in which we operate, both from third parties and former employees, which could result in the loss of one or more customers or lead to lower margins on new projects; 
 
 our ability to successfully manage and execute projects, the cost and availability of qualified labor and the ability to maintain positive labor relations, and our ability to pass along increases in the cost of commodities used in our business, in particular, copper, aluminum, steel, fuel, electronic components and certain plastics;

 inaccurate estimates used when entering into fixed-price contracts, the possibility of errors when estimating revenue and progress to date on percentage-of-completion contracts, and complications associated with the incorporation of new accounting, control and operating procedures; 
 
 our ability to enter into, and the terms of, future contracts; 
 
 the existence of a small number of customers from whom we derive a meaningful portion of our revenues; 
 
 reliance on third parties, including subcontractors and suppliers, to complete our projects; 
 
 the inability to carry out plans and strategies as expected, including the inability to identify and complete acquisitions that meet our investment criteria in furtherance of our corporate strategy, or the subsequent underperformance of those acquisitions; 
 
 challenges integrating new businesses into the Company or new types of work, products or processes into our segments; 
 
 backlog that may not be realized or may not result in profits; 
 
 failure to adequately recover on contract change orders or claims against customers; 
 
 closures or sales of our facilities resulting in significant future charges, including potential warranty losses or other unexpected liabilities, or a significant disruption of our operations; 
 
 the impact of future epidemics or pandemics on our business, including the potential for new or continued job site closures or work stoppages, supply chain disruptions, delays in awarding new project bids, construction delays, reduced demand for our services, delays in our ability to collect from our customers, or illness of management or other employees; 
 
 an increased cost of surety bonds affecting margins on work and the potential for our surety providers to refuse bonding or require additional collateral at their discretion; 
 
 the impact of seasonality, adverse weather conditions, and climate change; 
 
 1 

fluctuations in operating activity due to factors such as cyclicality, downturns in levels of construction or the housing market, and differing regional economic conditions; 
 
 difficulties in managing our billings and collections; 
 
 accidents resulting from the physical hazards associated with our work and the potential for accidents; 
 
 the possibility that our current insurance coverage may not be adequate or that we may not be able to obtain policies at acceptable rates; 
 
 the effect of litigation, claims and contingencies, including warranty losses, damages or other latent defect claims in excess of our existing reserves and accruals; 
 
 costs and liabilities under existing or potential future laws and regulations, including those laws and regulations related to the environment and climate change, as well as the inability to transfer, renew and obtain electrical and other professional licenses; 
 
 interruptions to our information systems and cyber security or data breaches; 
 
 expenditures to conduct environmental remediation activities required by certain environmental laws and regulations; 
 
 loss of key personnel, ineffective transition of new management, or general labor constraints; 
 
 credit and capital market conditions, including changes in interest rates that affect the cost of construction financing and mortgages, and the inability of some of our customers to obtain sufficient financing at acceptable rates, which could lead to project delays or cancellations; 
 
 limitations on our ability to access capital markets and generate cash from operations to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures, to complete acquisitions, and for debt service; 
 
 the impact on our effective tax rate or cash paid for taxes from changes in tax positions we have taken or changes in tax laws; 
 
 difficulty in fulfilling the covenant terms of our revolving credit facility, including liquidity, and other financial requirements, which could result in a default and acceleration of any indebtedness under such revolving credit facility; 
 
 reliance on certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results in the preparation of our financial statements; 
 
 uncertainties inherent in the use of percentage-of-completion accounting, which could result in the reduction or elimination of previously recorded revenues and profits; 
 
 the recognition of potential goodwill, long-lived assets and other investment impairments; 
 
 the existence of a controlling shareholder, who has the ability to take action not aligned with other shareholders or to dispose of all or a significant portion of the shares of our common stock it holds, which may trigger certain change of control provisions in a number of our material agreements, including our financing and surety arrangements and our executive severance plan; 
 
 the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares; 
 
 the possibility that we issue additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or convertible securities that will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing stockholders and may dilute the value per share of our common stock; 
 
 the potential for substantial sales of our common stock, which could adversely affect our stock price; 
 
 the impact of increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors and customers, or new or changing regulations, with respect to environmental, social and governance practices; 
 
 the cost or effort required for our shareholders to bring certain claims or actions against us, as a result of our designation of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings; and 
 
 the possibility that our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent all possible errors that could occur. 
 
 You should understand that the foregoing, as well as other risk factors discussed in this document, including those listed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those experienced previously or those expressed in such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any information, including information concerning our controlling shareholder, borrowing availability or cash position, or any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report. Forward-looking statements are 
 2

Item 1. Business 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 IES Holdings, Inc. designs and installs integrated electrical and technology systems and provides infrastructure products and services to a variety of end markets, including data centers, residential housing and commercial and industrial facilities. Our operations are organized into four business segments, based upon the nature of our services: 
 
 Communications Nationwide provider of technology infrastructure services, including the design, build, and maintenance of the communications infrastructure within data centers for co-location and managed hosting customers, for both large corporations and independent businesses. 
 
 Residential Regional provider of electrical installation services for single-family housing and multi-family apartment complexes, as well as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and plumbing installation services in certain markets. 
 
 Infrastructure Solutions Provider of electro-mechanical solutions for industrial operations, including apparatus repair and custom-engineered products, such as generator enclosures used in data centers and other industrial applications. 
 
 Commercial Industrial Provider of electrical and mechanical design, construction, and maintenance services to the commercial and industrial markets in various regional markets and nationwide in certain areas of expertise, such as the power infrastructure market and data centers. 
 
 While sharing common goals and values, each of the Company s segments manages its own day-to-day operations. Our corporate office is focused on significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and selection of segment leadership. The corporate office also assists with strategic and operational improvement initiatives, talent development, sharing of best practices across the organization and the establishment and monitoring of risk management practices within our segments. 
 
 IES Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware corporation established in 1997 and headquartered in Houston, Texas, with an executive office in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
 
 CORPORATE STRATEGY 
 
 We seek to create shareholder value by growing our business through increasing our market share, geographic and market expansion and adding to our capabilities, as well as improving operating margins and generating free cash flow, by investing in our existing businesses and completing acquisitions. We primarily seek to acquire businesses that strategically complement our existing business segments. In addition, we may seek to acquire or invest in stand-alone platform companies based in North America. In evaluating potential acquisition candidates, we seek to invest in businesses with, among other characteristics: 
 
 proven management with a willingness to continue post-acquisition; 
 low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; 
 established market position and sustainable competitive advantages; and 
 strong cash flow characteristics. 
 
 We believe that acquisitions provide an opportunity to expand into new or related services, products, end markets or geographic areas and diversify our revenue and profit streams. While we may use acquisitions to build our presence in the industries we serve, we will also consider potential acquisitions in other industries, which could result in changes in our operations from those historically conducted by us.

 For additional financial information by segment, see Note 11, Operating Segments in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Communications 
 
 Business Description 
 Originally established in 1984, our Communications segment is a leading provider of network infrastructure solutions for data centers and other mission critical environments. Our services include the design, installation and maintenance of network infrastructure for leading and recognizable global technology, social networking and e-commerce brands, including many Fortune 100 and 500 corporations. We serve a variety of industries and end markets, including data centers for co-location and managed hosting customers; corporate, educational, financial, hospitality and healthcare buildings; e-commerce distribution centers; and high-tech manufacturing facilities. We also provide the design and installation of audio/visual, telephone, fire, wireless access and intrusion alarm systems, as well as design/build, service and maintenance of data network systems. We perform services across the United States from our 24 offices, which includes the segment headquarters located in Tempe, Arizona, and also provide dedicated onsite teams at our customers sites. 
 
 Industry Overview 
 Our Communications segment is driven by demand for computing and storage resources as a result of technology advancements and obsolescence and changes in data consumption patterns. Demand in the data center market remains strong, and we continue to provide technology infrastructure services for applications such as data centers, distribution centers, and high-tech manufacturing facilities. As technology evolves, we are focused on expanding our capabilities as an integrator of audio-visual and other building technology offerings, which continue to experience strong demand. At September 30, 2024, our Communications business has a record level of backlog. However, if customers in our end markets reduce their capital budgets due to economic, technological or other factors, this could result in a decrease in activity for our Communications segment. While demand remains strong across our key end markets, the pace of growth in this business may also be slowed by the availability of labor. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales strategy relies on a concentrated business development effort, with centralized marketing programs and direct end-customer communications and relationships. Due to the mission critical nature of the facilities we service, our end-customers significantly rely upon our past performance record, technical expertise and specialized knowledge. A significant portion of our Communications business volume is generated from long-term, repeat customers, some of whom use IES as a preferred provider for major projects. 
 
 Our long-term strategy is to improve our position as a preferred solutions and services provider to large national corporations and strategic local companies. Key elements of our long-term strategy include continued investment in our employees technical expertise and expansion of our on-site maintenance and recurring revenue model, as well as opportunistic acquisitions of businesses that serve our markets, consistent with our stated corporate strategy. 
 
 Competition 
 Our competition consists of both large national or regional competitors and small, privately owned contractors who generally have limited access to capital. We compete on quality of service and/or price and seek to emphasize our financial capabilities and long history of delivering high quality solutions to our customers. 
 
 4 

Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 
 The effects of seasonality on our Communications business are not significant, as work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather. Our service and maintenance business is also generally not affected by seasonality. However, communications infrastructure spending has historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period. 

Residential 
 
 Business Description 
 Originally established in 1973, our Residential segment is a leading provider of electrical installation services for single-family housing and multi-family apartment complexes, as well as HVAC and plumbing installation services in certain markets, and cable television installations for residential and light commercial applications. The Residential segment also provides services for the installation of residential solar power, both for new construction and existing residences. The Residential segment is made up of 75 total locations, which include the segment headquarters in Houston, Texas. These locations geographically cover the Sun-Belt, Western, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Northeastern regions of the United States. 
 
 Industry Overview 
 Our Residential business is closely correlated to the single and multi-family housing market. Although demand for both single-family and multi-family housing has increased in recent years, due to economic, technological or other factors, there can be no assurance that overall construction and demand will continue to increase in the future. In our single-family business, we remain cautious about demand for single-family housing, as elevated mortgage rates and the impacts of inflation on materials and labor costs have resulted in a decline in housing affordability. In addition, expectations of falling interest rates over the next year could cause consumers to delay home purchases in anticipation of lower mortgage costs. However, in the longer term, we still expect strong demand for new single-family housing. In our multi-family business, elevated interest rates in fiscal 2024 and tighter lending conditions for project owners have resulted in a reduction in backlog at September 30, 2024 compared with September 30, 2023. As a result, we expect a reduction in multi-family revenue for fiscal 2025 compared with fiscal 2024. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Demand for our Residential services is highly dependent on the number of single-family and multi-family home starts in the markets we serve. Although we operate in multiple states, the majority of our single-family revenues are derived from services provided in Texas and Florida. The majority of our multi-family revenue is earned in Texas and across the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions. Our sales efforts include a variety of strategies, including a concentrated focus on national and regional homebuilders and multi-family developers and a local sales strategy for single and multi-family housing projects. A significant portion of our Residential business volume is generated from long-term, repeat customers, some of whom use IES as a preferred provider for major projects. 
 
 Our long-term strategy is to continue to be a leading provider of electrical services to the residential market, and to continue to expand our offerings of plumbing and HVAC services into markets where we previously offered only electrical services, while also expanding all service offerings into new geographic markets. The key elements of our long-term strategy include a continued focus on maintaining a low and variable cost structure and cash generation, allowing us to effectively scale according to the housing cycle, and to opportunistically increase our market share. 
 
 Competition 
 Our competition primarily consists of small, privately owned contractors who generally have limited access to capital. We believe that we have a competitive advantage over these smaller competitors due to our key employees long-standing customer relationships, our financial capabilities, our employee training program, and our local market knowledge and competitive pricing. There are few barriers to entry for electrical contracting services in the residential markets. 
 
 Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 
 Results of operations from our Residential segment can be seasonal, depending on weather trends, with typically higher revenues generated during spring and summer and lower revenues during fall and winter. In addition, the construction industry has historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in multi-family occupancy rates as well as single-family housing starts within our operational footprint. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period.

Infrastructure Solutions 
 
 Business Description 
 Our Infrastructure Solutions segment provides electro-mechanical solutions for industrial operations to domestic and international customers. Our Custom Engineered Solutions business includes the manufacture of custom commercial and industrial generator enclosures, the manufacture of custom-engineered power distribution equipment, including metal enclosed bus duct solutions used in power distribution, and structural steel fabrication and services. Our Industrial Services business includes the maintenance and repair of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) electric motors and generators, as well as power generating and distribution equipment; the manufacture, re-manufacture, and repair of industrial lifting magnets; and maintenance and repair of railroad main and auxiliary generators, main alternators, and traction motors. 
 
 This segment serves the steel, railroad, marine, petrochemical, pipeline, pulp and paper, wind energy, mining, automotive, power generation, scrap yards, data center, and utility industries. Our Infrastructure Solutions segment is comprised of 13 locations in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and West Virginia, and is headquartered in Massillon, Ohio. 
 
 Industry Overview 
 Given the diverse end-markets of Infrastructure Solutions customers, we are subject to many economic trends. In general, demand for our services has been driven by growth in industries, such as data centers, in-house maintenance departments continuing to outsource maintenance and repair work, output levels and equipment utilization at heavy industrial facilities, railroad companies and mass transit authorities capital investments and repair needs, investment in the United States aging energy and industrial infrastructure, demand for critical power applications that have high power demands and require dependable power supplies, the need for electrical or pipeline infrastructure improvements and the overall health of the economy. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales efforts are primarily driven by personnel based at our operating locations, as well as independent sales representatives. Our custom-engineered power distribution, bus system and generator enclosure products and services are principally sold in partnership with an original equipment manufacturer OEM or to an engineering, procurement and construction firm on behalf of the end-user. Regarding our apparatus repair services, the majority of our customers are located within a 200-mile radius of our facilities, and we believe that the locations of our facilities allow us to rapidly address and respond to the needs of our customers. Our long-term strategy is to be a leader in custom-engineered metal enclosed bus systems and generator enclosures and the preferred solutions provider of outsourced electro-mechanical services, repairs, and manufacturing to our select markets. 
 
 Competition 
 Our competition ranges from small, single location service centers to large, multi-national companies. Our Custom Engineered Solutions business competes with domestic and international manufacturers and distributors. We believe that we have a competitive advantage due to our specific product offerings, geographic proximity to customer sites, and our ability to design high quality products to meet each customer's unique requirements. Our Industrial Services business competes with small, specialized manufacturing and repair shops, a limited number of other multi-location providers of electric motor repair, engineering and maintenance services, and various OEMs. Participants in this industry compete primarily on the basis of capabilities, service, quality, timeliness and price. We believe that we have a competitive advantage due to our breadth of capabilities, focus on quality, technical support, customer service, and financial resources. 
 
 Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 
 Infrastructure Solutions revenues from its custom-engineered bus systems and generator enclosures are affected by the timing of customers' capital spending projects. Revenues from industrial services may be affected by the timing of scheduled outages at its industrial customers facilities and by weather conditions with respect to projects conducted outdoors, but the effects of seasonality on revenues in its industrial services business are not significant. Infrastructure Solutions quarterly results may fluctuate, and the results of one fiscal quarter may not be representative of the results of any other quarter or of the full fiscal year. 

Commercial Industrial 
 
 Business Description 
 Our Commercial Industrial segment provides electrical and mechanical design, service, and construction services to commercial and industrial markets. Our construction services range from the initial planning and procurement to installation and start-up and are offered to a variety of new and remodel construction projects, ranging from the construction of office buildings and industrial facilities to transmission and distribution projects. Our design services range from budget assistance to providing design-build and LEED (Leadership in Energy Environmental Design) solutions to our end customers. Our maintenance and emergency services include 
 6 

critical plant shutdown, troubleshooting, emergency testing, preventative maintenance, and constant presence. We also provide mechanical services such as maintenance agreements, installation, or replacement of mechanical equipment for commercial and industrial facilities. 
 
 This segment provides services for a variety of project types, including office buildings, manufacturing facilities, data centers, wind farms, solar facilities, municipal infrastructure and health care facilities. The Commercial Industrial segment consists of 17 locations, which includes the segment headquarters in Houston, Texas. Geographically, these locations cover Texas, Nebraska, Oregon, Wisconsin, and the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. 
 
 Industry Overview 
 Given the diverse end markets of our Commercial Industrial customers, which include both commercial buildings, such as offices, healthcare facilities and schools, and industrial projects, such as power, agricultural and food processing, and heavy manufacturing facilities, we are subject to many trends within the construction industry. In general, demand for our Commercial Industrial services is driven by construction and renovation activity levels, economic growth, and availability of bank or other financing. Due to economic, technological or other factors, there can be no assurance that construction and demand will increase. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales focus varies by location, but is primarily based upon regional and local relationships and a demonstrated expertise in certain areas, such as heavy industrial, design-build, agricultural, or transmission and distribution. Our maintenance and certain renovation and upgrade work tends to be either recurring or experience lower sensitivity to economic cycles, or both. A significant portion of our larger projects is awarded from long-term, repeat customers. From time to time, we are contracted on projects with completion times extending beyond one year or over several years, which are generally more complex and difficult to estimate. 
 
 Competition 
 The electrical and mechanical contracting services industry is generally highly competitive and includes a number of regional or small privately-held local firms. Traditionally, competitors in certain parts of this market have faced few barriers to entry. Therefore, we seek to pursue projects where our access to capital and expertise provide a competitive advantage. 
 
 Industry expertise, project size, location and past performance determine our bidding strategy, the level of involvement from competitors and our level of success in bidding for new work. Our primary advantages vary by location and market, but mostly are based upon local individual relationships with key customers or a demonstrated industry expertise. Additionally, due to the size of many of our projects, our financial resources help us compete effectively against local competitors. 
 
 Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 
 The effects of seasonality on our Commercial Industrial business are not significant, as most of our work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather. However, we do perform some work outdoors, which can be affected by the weather. Most of our service and maintenance business is also generally not affected by seasonality. However, the construction industry has historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in construction projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period. 

SOURCES OF SUPPLY 
 
 The raw materials and components we use within our segments include, but are not limited to, electrical fixtures and system components, copper, aluminum, raw steel, and certain plastics. These raw materials and components are generally available from a variety of domestic suppliers at competitive prices. Delivery times are typically short for most raw materials and standard components, but during periods of peak demand, may extend to one month or more. Fluctuations in lead times in sourcing certain components may lead to project inefficiencies resulting from schedule extensions. We are also exposed to increases in the prices of certain commodities. Our strategy to reduce commodity cost exposure includes early buying of commodities for particular projects or general inventory, as well as including escalation and escape provisions in project bids, quotes and contracts wherever possible. However, such protections are not included in every contract or project, and in such cases, we may not be fully reimbursed for increases in commodity prices by our customers and may be exposed to commodity price volatility on longer-term projects where we have prepaid for commodities. 
 RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
 The primary risks in our existing operations include project bidding and management, bodily injury, property and environmental damage, and construction defects. We monitor project bidding and management practices at various levels within the Company. We 
 7 

maintain automobile, general liability and construction defect insurance for third-party health, bodily injury and property damage, as well as pollution coverage and workers compensation coverage, which we consider appropriate to insure against these risks. Our third-party insurance is subject to deductibles for which we establish reserves. In light of these risks, we are also committed to a strong safety and environmental compliance culture. We have a robust safety program, and seek to maintain standardized safety and environmental policies and procedures. We are also subject to cyber security and information theft risks in our operations, which we seek to manage through a cyber and information security program, training and insurance coverage. Given the dynamic and evolving nature of cyber threats, we cannot be assured that we are protected against all such threats. 
 
 In the electrical contracting industry, our ability to post surety bonds provides us with an advantage over competitors that are smaller or have fewer financial resources. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet, as well as a good relationship with our bonding providers, enhances our ability to obtain adequate financing and surety bonds, although there can be no assurance that surety bonding coverage will be available when we need it. For a further discussion of our risks, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 CUSTOMERS 
 
 We have a diverse customer base. During both of the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one customer accounted for 12.0 of our consolidated revenues and no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues. No single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues during the year ended September 30, 2022. We emphasize developing and maintaining relationships with our customers by providing superior, high-quality service. Management at each of our segments is responsible for determining sales strategies and sales activities. 
 
 CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER 
 A majority of our outstanding common stock is owned by Tontine Associates, L.L.C. ("Tontine Associates") and its affiliates (collectively, Tontine ). Tontine owns approximately 55 percent of our outstanding common stock based on a Form 4 filed by Tontine with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on September 16, 2024, and the Company's shares outstanding as of November 18, 2024. As a result, Tontine can control most of our affairs, including most actions requiring the approval of shareholders, such as the approval of any potential merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or business segments, or the Company itself. Most of Tontine s shares are registered for resale on a resale shelf registration statement filed by the Company with the SEC. Tontine s sale of all or a significant portion of its shares could result in a change of control of the Company, which would trigger the change of control provisions in a number of our material agreements, including our credit agreement, bonding agreements with our sureties and our executive severance plan. For more information, see Note 3, Controlling Shareholder in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND BACKLOG 
 
 Remaining performance obligations represent the unrecognized revenue value of our contract commitments. While backlog is not a defined term under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), it is a common measurement used in our industry, and we believe it improves our ability to forecast future results and identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. Backlog is a measure of revenue that we expect to recognize from work that has yet to be performed on uncompleted contracts and from work that has been contracted but has not started, exclusive of short-term projects. While all of our backlog is supported by documentation from customers, backlog is not a guarantee of future revenues, as contractual commitments may change and our performance may vary. Not all of our work is performed under contracts included in backlog; for example, most of the apparatus repair work that is completed by our Infrastructure Solutions segment is performed under master service agreements on an as-needed basis. Additionally, electrical installation services for single-family housing at our Residential segment are completed on a short-term basis and are therefore excluded from backlog. The table below summarizes our remaining performance obligations and backlog by segment: 
 September 30, 2024 2023 Remaining Performance Obligations Agreements without an enforceable obligation (1) 
 Backlog Remaining Performance Obligations Agreements without an enforceable obligation (1) 
 Backlog (Dollars in millions) Communications 448,783 66,878 515,661 369,928 42,239 412,167 Residential 329,364 95,124 424,488 414,179 103,657 517,836 Infrastructure Solutions 100,815 426,749 527,564 109,082 240,683 349,765 Commercial Industrial 296,733 21,708 318,441 250,234 28,010 278,244 Total 1,175,695 610,459 1,786,154 1,143,423 414,589 1,558,012 
 (1) Our backlog includes signed agreements and letters of intent that we do not have a legal right to enforce prior to beginning work. These agreements are excluded from remaining performance obligations until work begins. 
 
 We expect that 1.3 billion of our September 30, 2024 backlog will result in revenue during fiscal 2025, with the remaining 0.5 billion expected to be realized in fiscal 2026; however, there can be no assurance that this backlog will be completed within expected time frames or at all. The increase in our backlog year over year was primarily driven by strong demand and increased market share. 

REGULATIONS 
 
 Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including: 
 
 licensing requirements applicable to electricians, plumbers, and mechanical service technicians; 
 
 building and electrical codes; 
 
 regulations relating to worker safety, labor relations and protection of the environment; 
 
 regulations relating to consumer protection, including those governing residential service agreements; and 
 
 qualifications of our business legal structure in the jurisdictions where we do business. 
 
 Many state and local regulations governing electricians and mechanical services require permits and licenses to be held by individuals engaged in such services. In some cases, a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all our electricians or mechanical service technicians who work in the state or county that issued the permit or license. While we seek permits or licenses, where available, that may be material to our operations in a particular geographic area to be held by multiple employees within that area, given the large number of permits and licenses required, we are unable to ensure that multiple employees hold such required permits and licenses. 
 
 We believe that we have all licenses required to conduct our operations and are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses or an inability to perform government work.

CAPITAL FACILITIES 
 
 During fiscal year 2024, the Company maintained a revolving credit facility, as further described in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of the Company s capital resources, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 For the Company s financial information by segment, see Note 11, Operating Segments in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 
 At IES, we believe that attracting and retaining highly qualified and motivated employees at all levels is a key driver of our continued growth and success. Our human capital management objectives include recruiting, retaining, developing, incentivizing and integrating our current and prospective employees as well as prioritizing and protecting their safety. 
 
 Our Employees 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 9,485 employees, of which 9,423 were full-time employees. We are party to two collective bargaining agreements covering fewer than 30 employees within our Infrastructure Solutions segment. We have not experienced, and do not expect, any work stoppage, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is strong. 
 
 We are committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and our policies prohibit discrimination based on race, color, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, marital status, national origin, ethnicity, citizenship status, religious creed or belief, physical or mental disability, protected veteran status and relatives of protected veterans, marital or familial status, legally protected medical condition, genetic information and any other status protected by local, state or federal law. This commitment applies to all aspects of employment, including recruitment, hiring, training, compensation, job assignment, advancement, performance feedback and separation. 
 
 We strive to support our employees and their families health by offering comprehensive benefits programs, including medical, dental, vision and prescription insurance. We also offer our employees a 401(k) plan, and life and disability insurance plans. 
 
 Recruiting and Training 
 
 A key factor in IES s long-term strategy is the recruitment and retention of high-quality employees. We use both internal and external resources to recruit employees, including monitoring competitive compensation levels in the markets in which we operate. Our Communications segment has entered into a partnership with the U.S. Army to guarantee job interviews to those who have completed Army Reserve training or a first term of active duty service, and we value the leadership and work ethic military veterans bring to the Company. 
 
 We have invested significant resources in development opportunities for employees. For example, our Residential segment has established two residential education centers, which are dedicated facilities that train employees from around the country in the technical skills necessary for successful careers in residential electrical, plumbing and HVAC contracting. At all of our segments, partly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded online training offerings to help meet the needs of our changing workplaces. We believe our investment in training supports employee motivation and retention at the same time that it improves productivity and performance. 
 
 Safety 
 
 We are committed to fostering a strong safety culture that supports the health, safety and wellness of our employees, and this commitment is reflected in our track record of workplace safety that exceeds industry averages. Our regional safety managers, under the supervision of our Senior Vice President of Safety, seek to maintain standardized safety and environmental policies, programs and procedures and provide personal protective equipment relevant to each segment, including programs to train new employees. Our safety leadership continuously monitors and addresses safety performance, provides regular training and educational programs on safety and participates in numerous industry safety organizations.

LOCATIONS 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have 131 domestic locations. In addition to our 2 executive and corporate offices, as of September 30, 2024, we have 24 locations within our Communications business, 75 locations within our Residential business, 13 locations within our Infrastructure Solutions business and 17 locations within our Commercial Industrial business. This geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to unfavorable economic developments in any given region.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 You should consider carefully the risks described below, as well as the other information included in this document before making an investment decision. Our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks, and the value of your investment may decrease due to any of these risks. 
 
 Risks Relating to the Operations of our Business 
 
 Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns affecting the industries we serve. 
 
 Demand for our services has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the construction industry, the housing market, and other industries in which our end customers operate. Many of our customers depend on the availability of credit to purchase our services or electrical and mechanical products. In the past, when the general level of economic activity has been reduced from historical levels, certain of our customers have delayed or cancelled projects or capital spending, thereby reducing our revenues and profitability. General concerns about the fundamental soundness of the economy may cause customers to defer projects, even if they have credit available to them. Prolonged uncertainties in the credit market, or the return of constrained credit market conditions, including the impact of interest rates in the housing markets, could adversely affect demand, which would have adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We could be adversely impacted by changes in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation, supply chain constraints, and an economic downturn or recession. 
 
 Our business and the industries in which we operate are vulnerable to changing macroeconomic conditions, including supply chain constraints, high rates of inflation, changes in consumer sentiment, elevated interest rates, and market disruptions resulting from a number of factors, including geo-political events such as the Ukraine-Russia war, the conflict in the Middle East, and trade tensions between the U.S. and China. These and other market factors have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our revenues and our cost for labor, materials, utilities, and other goods and services as well as our ability to collect on our outstanding receivables, to the extent our customers are affected by the same negative conditions. Further, if the U.S. economy experiences a downturn or recession, our customers may be unable to obtain financing for new projects, or they may decide to delay or cancel projects even if they have credit available to them. As a result, these conditions have had, and they or any similar future conditions may continue to have, adverse impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The highly competitive nature of our industries could affect our profitability by reducing our revenues or profit margins. 
 
 The industries in which we compete are highly fragmented and are generally served by many small, owner-operated private companies. There are also several large private regional companies and a small number of large public companies from which we face competition in these industries. In the future, we could also face competition from new competitors entering these markets because certain segments, such as our electrical contracting services, have a relatively low barrier for entry while other segments, such as our services and custom engineered electro-mechanical products for mission critical infrastructure, have attractive growth and profitability characteristics. Some of our competitors in certain markets may offer a greater range of services than we offer in those markets, including mechanical construction and facilities management. Competition in our markets depends on a number of factors, including price. Some of our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide services comparable to ours at lower rates than we do. If we are unable to offer our services at competitive prices or if we have to reduce our prices to remain competitive, our profitability would be impaired. 
 
 We generate a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. The estimates we use in placing bids and changes in commodity and labor costs could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain our profitability. 
 
 We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts. The cost of fuel, labor and materials, including copper wire or other commodities, may vary significantly from the costs we originally estimate. Variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts, including our ability to successfully manage and execute projects, have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, actual revenue and gross profits for a project differing from those we originally estimated and could result in losses on projects. Depending upon the size of a particular project, variations from estimated contract costs can have a significant impact on our operating results. 
 
 12 

If the costs associated with labor and commodities, such as copper, aluminum, steel, electrical components, fuel, and certain plastics, increase due to low supply, inflation, general market conditions, supply chain disruptions and delays, or other forces, losses may be incurred. Some of our materials have been and may continue to be subject to sudden and significant price increases, and continued high demand and low supply for those resources may lead to additional price increases. Depending on competitive pressures and the fixed price nature of many of our contracts, we may not be able to pass on these cost increases to our customers, which would reduce our gross profit margins and, in turn, make it more difficult for us to maintain our profitability. We have a work force of over 9,000 employees, and our labor costs may fluctuate based on availability of and demand for workers as well as other labor related risks, including risks related to collective bargaining agreements, benefits arrangements, increased healthcare costs, wage and hour claims and other compensation arrangements. 
 
 A failure to secure new contracts may adversely affect our cash flows and financial results. 
 
 Much of our revenue is derived from projects that are awarded through a competitive bid process. Contract bidding and negotiations are affected by a number of factors, including our own cost structure and bidding policies. The failure to bid and be awarded projects, cancellations of projects or delays in project start dates could affect our ability to deploy our assets profitably. In addition, our ability to secure new contracts depends on our ability to maintain all required electrical, construction, mechanical and business licenses. If we fail to successfully transfer, renew or obtain such licenses where applicable, we may be unable to compete for new business. Further, when we are awarded contracts, we face additional risks that could affect whether, or when, work will begin. We could experience a decrease in profitability if we are unable to replace canceled, completed or expired contracts with new work. 
 
 We derive a meaningful portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 We have one customer that represented approximately 12.0 of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2024, and there are other customers that are significant to our individual operating segments. Although we have long-standing relationships with some of these significant customers, it is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand for our services by these customers, and if one or more of them were to significantly delay, reduce or curtail activity, or stop accepting bids from us, it could have a material impact on our operating results. 
 
 We rely on third parties, including subcontractors and suppliers, in connection with many of our projects and a failure to retain subcontractors or obtain supplies, or increased costs as a result of using these third parties, could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 We hire third-party subcontractors to perform work on certain of our projects, and if we are unable to retain qualified subcontractors or if our subcontractors do not perform in accordance with their obligations, we have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, additional costs or experience delays in project execution, which could subject us to contractual penalties. We also rely on suppliers for the materials necessary to complete our projects, and if a supplier fails to provide supplies when scheduled or at a higher than price than expected, project delays and additional costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results. 
 
 Our inability to carry out plans and strategies as expected, including our inability to identify and complete acquisitions and investments that meet our investment criteria in furtherance of our corporate strategy or the subsequent underperformance of those acquisitions and investments, may adversely impact our future growth and profitability. 
 
 Our corporate strategy includes creating shareholder value through acquiring businesses that we believe will strategically complement our existing business segments or acquiring or investing in stand-alone platform companies based in North America. While we believe that acquisitions will provide an opportunity to expand into new or related services, products, end-markets or geographic areas and diversify our revenue and profit streams, potential acquisitions could result in changes in our operations from those historically conducted by us and introduce the requirement for new controls. Alternatively, our failure to diversify from existing markets may limit our future growth. In addition, we have made, and may continue to make, investments in debt or equity securities of publicly traded and privately held companies, including early-stage companies and more established companies. We are subject to risks associated with these investments. In addition, we may have limited ability to dispose of these investments due to lack of an active market for or contractual limitations on our ability to sell a particular investment, and the partial or complete loss of invested capital, and significant changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio could adversely impact our financial results. Further, valuations of non-marketable debt and equity investments are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data and may involve subjective judgments and estimates. Some of our past acquisitions and investments have not performed as expected, and there is no assurance that future acquisitions and investments will perform as expected or generate a positive return on investment due to factors we could not predict prior to the acquisition or due to incorrect investment assumptions. 
 
 13 

Acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions that we may pursue could have a negative effect on our results of operations. 
 
 We are actively seeking to engage in acquisitions of operations, assets and investments, or to develop new types of work or processes, and we may seek to engage in dispositions of certain operations, assets or investments from time to time. If we are unable to successfully integrate newly acquired assets or operations or if we make untimely or unfavorable investments or dispositions, it could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and the market value of our common stock. Additionally, any future acquisition, investment or disposition may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities, and as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and the market value of our common stock following any such acquisition, investment or disposition may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our financial condition, results of operations and market value of our common stock. 
 
 The difficulties of integrating a business, assets or operations may include, among other things: 
 geographically separated organizations and possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies; 
 significant demands on management resources, which may distract management s attention from day-to-day business; 
 differences in the disclosure systems, compliance requirements, accounting systems, and accounting controls and procedures of the acquired company, which may interfere with our ability to make timely and accurate public disclosure; and 
 the demands of managing new locations, new personnel and new lines of business acquired. 
 
 Backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits. 
 
 Customers often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or release work to us, and many contracts may be terminated on short notice. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation of one or more contracts by a customer or for other reasons, or our failure to execute projects in backlog as expected, could significantly reduce the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts included in backlog. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. 
 
 We may fail to adequately recover on contract change orders. 
 
 From time to time, we may pursue claims against our customers to recover costs incurred on a project in excess of the original contract amount. Such additional costs may be incurred in connection with project delays caused by our customers or third parties, including other trades, or changes in project scope or specifications. While we generally negotiate with the customer for additional compensation, we may be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise, adequate compensation for the additional work performed or expenses incurred. The process of pursuing a claim may be lengthy, result in significant legal fees, and negatively impact our relationships with customers. In addition, our ability to recover on contract change orders could be negatively impacted by our customers' reduced access to capital in a weak economic environment, particularly in a period of restrictive credit markets. Furthermore, we may be required to invest significant working capital to fund cost overruns while the resolution of a claim is pending, and our additional costs may not be recovered until the claim is resolved, if at all. When appropriate, we establish provisions against possible exposures, and we adjust these provisions from time to time, but our assumptions and estimates related to these exposures might prove to be inadequate or inaccurate. Unfavorable resolution of these matters can result in a reduction of revenues and profit recognized in prior periods or the recognition of a loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We may incur significant charges or be adversely impacted by the closure or sale of facilities or assets. 
 
 In the past, we incurred significant costs associated with the closure or disposition of facilities, and we expect from time to time to evaluate the need for future facility closures or dispositions of assets. If we were to elect to dispose of a substantial portion of any of our segments, facilities, or assets, the realized values of such assets could be substantially less than current book values, which would likely result in a material adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, we may have warranty claims, costs pursuant to obligations to indemnify buyers after assets are sold, or other unexpected liabilities from closed facilities beyond the closing date, and if we dispose of a segment or business, we may continue to be subject to certain prior liabilities of that business after its disposition and may not be able to negotiate for limitations on those liabilities, all of which could adversely impact our financial returns. 
 
 Epidemics, pandemics, and other potential public health emergencies could have a future materially adverse impact on our business, including our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 
 
 Pandemics and other public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had adverse impacts on our results of operations in the past. The impact of future epidemics, pandemics or other public health emergencies on our business is difficult to predict, but adverse impacts could include the potential for job site closures or work stoppages, supply chain disruptions, delays in 
 14 

awarding new project bids, construction delays, reduced demand for our services, delays in our ability to collect from our customers, or illness of management or other employees. 
 
 The availability and cost of surety bonds affect our ability to enter into new contracts and our margins on those engagements. 
 
 Many of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a surety. Those bonds guarantee the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. We obtain surety bonds from two primary surety providers; however, there is no commitment from these providers to guarantee our ability to issue bonds for projects as they are required. Our ability to access this bonding capacity is at the sole discretion of our surety providers. Accordingly, if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in our availability of bonding capacity, or if we are unable to obtain bonds at a reasonable cost, we may be unable to compete for, or work on, certain projects. 
 
 We are subject to risks associated with seasonality, adverse weather conditions, and climate change. 
 
 Our business is subject to seasonal variations in operations and demand that affect the construction business, particularly in the Residential and Commercial Industrial segments. Adverse weather conditions, including rain, heat, ice, cold or snow, may not only delay our work and contribute to project inefficiency, but may negatively impact our schedules and profitability by delaying the work of other trades on a construction site. Extreme weather conditions (such as hurricanes or other storms, droughts, extreme heat or cold, wildfires and floods) have from time to time had, and may in the future have, a negative impact on our business, including by limiting the availability of resources, increasing our costs, damaging property, disrupting our workforce, or causing projects to be delayed or cancelled. A portion of our business operates in certain geographic areas, such as Texas and Florida, where these risks are elevated. If the cost of property insurance in those or other geographic areas increases, or if it becomes more difficult to obtain, it could have a negative impact on customer demand, particularly in our Residential segment. To the extent climate change results in an increase in extreme weather events and adverse weather conditions, the likelihood of a negative impact on our results of operations may increase. 
 
 Our results may fluctuate from period to period due to cyclicality, regional economic conditions, or other factors. 
 
 Factors arising from the cyclicality of industries in which we operate, including the timing of new customer contracts, may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Our results from period to period may also be affected by regional economic conditions that affect the construction market. In particular, a prolonged period of weak demand in the oil and gas industry or increased regulatory restrictions on the industry could dampen the housing market in certain regions, resulting in reduced demand for the services provided by our Residential segment. Infrastructure Solutions revenues from industrial services may be affected by the timing of scheduled outages or capital projects at its industrial customers facilities, by demand for design, construction and site support of data centers, and by changes in spending in public infrastructure, power and steel markets. Industrial and rail customers may also be affected by volatility in oil prices. Accordingly, our performance in any particular quarter or year may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter, for the entire year, or for any other year. 
 
 We may experience difficulties in managing our billings and collections. 
 
 Our billings under fixed price contracts in our contracting business are generally based upon achieving certain milestones and will only be accepted by the customer once we demonstrate those milestones have been met. If we are unable to demonstrate compliance with billing requests, or if we fail to issue a project billing, our likelihood of collection could be delayed or impaired, which, if experienced across several large projects, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, some of our customers may be highly leveraged or may be subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which may also limit their ability to pay. 
 
 Our operations are subject to numerous physical hazards. If an accident occurs, it could result in an adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Hazards related to our industry include, but are not limited to, electrocutions, fires, injuries involving ladders, machinery-caused injuries, mechanical failures and transportation accidents. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and suspension of operations. While we have invested significant efforts in our safety programs in an effort to minimize safety risks, we have experienced serious accidents in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future. Serious accidents may subject us to penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Our insurance does not cover all types or amounts of liabilities. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time, our customers could cancel our contracts or not award us future business. 
 
 15 

Our current insurance coverage may not be adequate, and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates, or at all. 
 
 We maintain insurance coverage in part because some of our contracts require us to carry certain levels of insurance coverage, which is common in the industries in which we operate. Our third-party insurance is subject to deductibles for which we establish reserves. In addition, we maintain most of our employee health insurance coverage on a self-insured basis and are responsible for losses up to our stop loss coverage, which sets a limit on our liability for claim costs. No assurance can be given that our insurance or our provisions for incurred claims and incurred but not reported claims will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations, including employee health care costs, which have increased in recent years; nor can we provide assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at reasonable rates. 
 
 Litigation and claims can cause unexpected losses. 
 
 In all of our businesses, we are subject to potential claims and litigation, including contractual disputes, warranty claims, and claims related to our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings; such claims and litigation are common in the construction and electrical and mechanical maintenance businesses and may be related to contract delays, changes in the scope of work or alleged defects. There are also inherent claims and litigation risks associated with the number of people that work on construction sites and the fleet of vehicles on the road every day. In our Infrastructure Solutions businesses, we also may be subject to product liability litigation. We also have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to employment-related claims including workers' compensation, employment discrimination, and wage and hour claims. Claims are sometimes made and lawsuits filed for amounts in excess of their value or in excess of the amounts for which they are eventually resolved. Claims and litigation normally follow a predictable course of time to resolution. However, there may be periods of time in which a disproportionate amount of our claims and litigation are concluded in the same quarter or year. If multiple matters are resolved during a given period, then the cumulative effect of these matters may be higher than the ordinary level in any one reporting period. In addition, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings, which could result in significant expense, damage to our reputation and diversion of management s attention from our business. 
 
 Latent defect litigation is normal for residential home builders in some parts of the country. Any increases in our latent defect claims and litigation could place pressure on our profitability. 
 
 Regulatory requirements could result in significant compliance costs and liabilities. 
 
 We have operations throughout the United States and are subject to multiple state and local regulations. In addition, our segments from time to time perform work as federal government subcontractors, or perform work on projects that have received federal government funding, and as a result may be subject to federal laws and requirements applicable to government contractors. If we fail to comply with those requirements, we may be subject to fines, penalties or suspension from doing business with the federal government. Our 131 locations are located in 27 states, which exposes us to a variety of different state and local laws and regulations, including those pertaining to electrical contractor and other licensing requirements. These laws and regulations govern many aspects of our business, and there are often different standards and requirements in different locations. Changes in law, regulations or requirements, or a material failure to comply with any of them, could increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business by, among other things, increasing costs, harming our reputation and, in some instances, causing us to be in violation of our contractual obligations. In addition, we are required to maintain certain electrical, construction, mechanical and business licenses. If we fail to successfully transfer, renew or obtain such licenses where applicable, we may experience increased costs and other negative impacts on our business. 
 
 Disruptions to the proper functioning of our information technology systems or security breaches of our critical data, sensitive information or information technology systems could disrupt operations and cause increases in costs, decreases in revenues and/or harm to our reputation. 
 
 Our Company continues to increase its dependence on information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure to conduct our day-to-day operations and manage the way we provide services to our customers. Disruptions to our information technology systems or our failure to adequately protect critical data, sensitive information, and information technology systems could materially affect our business or result in harm to our reputation. Our critical accounting, project management, estimating, and financial information systems, some of which are third-party platforms, all rely on the proper functioning and security of our information technology environment and are critical to the successful operation of our business. We also collect and retain information about our customers, stockholders, vendors, and employees, with the expectation by such third parties being that we will adequately protect such information. Although our information technology systems, networks and infrastructure are protected through our policies, procedures and physical and software safeguards, our information technology environment is still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, telecommunication failures, deliberate intrusions, inadvertent user misuse or error, computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware 
 16 

attacks, acts of terrorism and other cyber security risks, which could cause a loss of critical data, or release of sensitive information. If critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, or if sensitive information is released, we could experience reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, loss of proprietary data, regulatory actions and scrutiny, statutory penalties, and litigation. 
 
 We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as ransomware attacks or unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, and privacy incidents, such as potential exposure of data. While to date such incidents have not had a material impact on our business, there can be no assurance that future incidents would not have an adverse effect on our business or reputation. Additionally, the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the acquired business s information systems or information handling, privacy and security policies and protocols, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems and data more vulnerable to attack. In addition, data privacy laws and regulations governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information may pose compliance challenges and result in additional costs for our businesses. A failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in penalties or fines, legal liabilities or reputational harm. 
 
 We may be required to conduct environmental remediation activities, which could be expensive and inhibit the growth of our business and our ability to maintain profitability, particularly in our Infrastructure Solutions business. 
 
 We are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations, including those concerning the handling, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials. These laws predominantly affect our Infrastructure Solutions business but may impact our other businesses. These environmental laws generally impose liability on current and former owners and operators, transporters and generators of hazardous materials for remediation of contaminated properties. We could be held liable for such contamination created not only from our own activities but also from the historical activities of companies we have acquired, or the activities of others on properties that we own or lease. There can be no assurance that the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures. In addition, if we do not comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to material administrative, civil or criminal penalties, or other substantial liabilities. 
 
 Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to climate change, could adversely impact our business. 
 
 Increasing concerns about climate change and other environmental issues may result in additional environmental regulations and restrictions, and we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could increase the costs of projects for us or our customers, potentially resulting in reduced profitability or a reduced demand for our services, or require us to incur substantial costs of compliance. 
 
 The loss of a group or several key personnel, either at the corporate or operating level, or general labor constraints could adversely affect our business. 
 
 The loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers, senior management and management personnel at our segments. As a service organization, relationships with significant customers can be dependent on certain employees within our organization, and our ability to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and support our growth strategy may be limited by our ability to retain and train necessary personnel. We cannot guarantee that any member of management at the corporate or operating segment level will continue in their capacity for any particular period of time, and there is significant competition in our industry for managerial personnel. We have a severance plan in place that covers certain of our senior leaders; however, this plan can neither guarantee that we will not lose key employees, nor prevent them from competing against us. If we lose a group of key personnel or even one key person at a segment, we may not be able to recruit suitable replacements at comparable salaries or at all, which could adversely affect our operations. Additionally, we generally do not maintain key man life insurance for members of our management. 
 
 Our business is labor intensive, and many of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover. We also may be constrained in hiring and retaining sufficient qualified employees to support our growth strategy due to general labor shortages in our industries. In addition, a lack of skilled labor or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees. Continued labor constraints may limit our ability to grow and may limit our profitability due to the impact of rising wages.

Risks Relating to our Financial Results, Financing and Liquidity 
 
 The impact on our customers of negative conditions in the credit and capital markets may adversely affect our business. 
 
 A number of economic factors, including financing conditions for our customers' industries, have, in the past, adversely affected our customers and their ability or willingness to fund expenditures. Many of our customers depend on the availability of credit to help finance their capital and maintenance projects. At times, tightened availability of credit and changes in interest rates that affect the cost of construction financing and mortgages have negatively impacted the ability of existing and prospective customers to obtain sufficient financing and fund projects we might otherwise perform. As a result, our customers may defer such projects for an unknown, and perhaps lengthy, period. Any such deferrals would inhibit our growth and would adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 In a weak economic environment, particularly in a period of restrictive credit markets, we may experience greater difficulties in collecting payments from our customers due to, among other reasons, a diminution in our ultimate customers access to the credit markets. If clients delay in paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and financial position. 
 
 To fund our working capital requirements, complete acquisitions and service any debt we may incur, we may require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash from operations or to access the capital markets for required funding depends on many factors that are beyond our control. 
 
 Our ability to continue to grow our business, including through acquisitions and the funding of working capital requirements, as well as our ability to make payments on or refinance any indebtedness we may incur, will depend on our ability to access capital markets and generate cash from operations in the future. This is subject to our operational performance, as well as general economic, financial, capital market, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. 
 
 There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or asset sales, or have access to sources of cash from the capital markets or from borrowings under our credit facility, in amounts sufficient to enable us to complete acquisitions, to service any debt we may incur or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance our credit facility on or before maturity. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance our credit facility on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to access capital on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Changes in tax positions or changes in tax laws may adversely affect our results. 
 
 Our effective tax rate and cash paid for taxes are impacted by the tax positions that we have adopted. Taxing authorities may not always agree with the positions we have taken. We have established reserves for tax positions that we have determined to be less than likely to be sustained by taxing authorities. However, there can be no assurance that our results of operations will not be adversely affected in the event that disagreement over our tax positions does arise. Additionally, new tax laws or changes in existing interpretation and guidance could affect our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for uncertain tax positions, potentially resulting in an increase to our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our results. 
 
 We have restrictions and covenants under our credit agreement and the failure to meet these covenants, including liquidity and other financial requirements, could result in a default under our credit agreement. 
 
 We may not be able to remain in compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement, including financial covenants which, among other things, require minimum levels of liquidity and require us to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage ratio as defined under our credit agreement. Other covenants, among other things, limit our ability to provide liens, restrict fundamental changes, limit transactions with affiliates and subsidiaries, restrict changes to our organization documents, limit asset dispositions, limit investments, limit the ability to incur debt, restrict certain payments to shareholders, limit our ability to repurchase our stock, and limit the ability to change the nature of our business. A failure to fulfill the terms and requirements of our credit agreement may result in a default under our credit agreement and acceleration of any indebtedness we may incur, as well as a default under one or more of our material agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition. 
 
 The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results, and we may be adversely impacted by new accounting, control and operating procedures. 
 
 GAAP accounting requires that a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated precisely from available data and, accordingly, requires the use of management s judgment. Estimates and assumptions are used in, among other areas, our assessment of revenue 
 18 

recognition of construction in progress, fair value assumptions in accounting for business combinations, stock-based compensation, reserves for legal matters, and realizability of deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, and such differences may be material to our financial statements. 
 
 In addition, we may be adversely impacted by new accounting pronouncements which change our revenue recognition or other accounting practices or otherwise alter how we report our financial results, or which require that we change our control and operating procedures, which we may be unable to do in a timely manner. 
 
 Our use of percentage-of-completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits. 
 
 A significant portion of our revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, utilizing the cost-to-cost method, which results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to contract costs incurred. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability. We review our estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability on an ongoing basis. Prior to contract completion, we may adjust our estimates on one or more occasions as a result of change orders to the original contract, collection disputes with the customer on amounts invoiced or claims against the customer for increased costs incurred by us due to customer-induced delays and other factors. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined to be probable and reasonably estimable. Although we have historically made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion of our construction contracts, the uncertainties inherent in the estimating process make it possible for actual costs to vary materially from estimates, including reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits. 
 
 Our reported operating results could be adversely affected as a result of goodwill impairment charges. 
 
 GAAP accounting requires that goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units be tested at least annually, or when changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value of our reporting units may not be recoverable. At September 30, 2024, we had recorded 94.0 million of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Factors that could lead to impairment of current goodwill in the future include significant adverse changes in the business climate, declines in the financial condition of our business, and actual or projected future operating results affecting the Company as a whole or affecting any particular reporting unit. On an ongoing basis, we expect to perform impairment tests at least annually as of September 30. Impairment adjustments, if any, are required to be recognized as operating expenses. We cannot assure that we will not have future impairment adjustments to our recorded goodwill. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Common Stock 
 
 Existence of a controlling shareholder. 
 
 A majority of our outstanding common stock is owned by Tontine, and Jeffrey Gendell, founder and managing member of Tontine, serves as our Chief Executive Officer and as Chairman of our Board of Directors. Tontine owns approximately 55 percent of the Company s outstanding common stock based on a Form 4 filed by Tontine with the SEC on September 16, 2024, and the Company's shares outstanding as of November 18, 2024. As a result, Tontine can control most of our affairs, including the election of our directors, who in turn appoint executive management and can control most actions requiring the approval of shareholders, including the adoption of amendments to our corporate charter and approval of any potential merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or business segments or the Company itself. This control also gives Tontine the ability to bring matters to a shareholder vote that may not be in the best interest of our other shareholders or stakeholders. The concentration of ownership may also have the effect of discouraging a change in control transaction, which could prevent other shareholders from selling their shares in the Company at a premium as part of such transaction. Additionally, Tontine is in the business of investing in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us or act as suppliers or customers of the Company. Most of Tontine's shares are registered for resale on a resale shelf registration statement filed by the Company with the SEC. Pursuant to such resale shelf registration statement, Tontine has the ability to resell any or all of its registered shares from time to time in one or more offerings as long as the registration statement remains effective and the Company remains eligible to use it, as described further in the registration statement and in any prospectus supplement filed in connection with an offering pursuant to the shelf registration statement. Tontine s sale of all or a significant portion of its shares could result in a change of control of the Company, which may trigger the change of control provisions in a number of our material agreements, including our credit agreement, bonding agreements with our sureties, and our executive severance plan. 
 
 Our common stock has less liquidity than many other stocks listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. 
 
 Historically, the trading volume of our common stock has been relatively low when compared to other companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Market or other stock exchanges. While we have experienced increased liquidity in our stock during recent years compared with historical levels, we cannot say with certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for our common stock will continue to 
 19 

develop. Because of this, it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares. 
 
 In addition, our historically lower liquidity has in the past contributed to increased volatility in the price of our common stock. This lower liquidity, along with the other risk factors discussed herein, may impact our stock price in the future. 
 
 We may issue additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or convertible securities that will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing stockholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock. 
 
 Our authorized capital includes 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had 22,049,529 shares of common stock issued, 19,971,670 shares of common stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, we had the ability to issue 581,169 shares of common stock, including upon the exercise of options, as future grants under our existing equity compensation plans. 
 
 Although we currently do not have any intention of issuing additional common stock (other than pursuant to our equity compensation plans) or preferred stock, we may do so in the future as consideration for certain acquisitions and in order to meet our capital needs. Subject to applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules, our Board of Directors generally has the authority, without action by or vote of the stockholders, to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock for any corporate purpose. We may seek additional equity capital in the future as we develop our business and expand our operations. Any issuance of additional shares of common stock, preferred stock, or convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our stockholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock. 
 
 Substantial sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price. 
 
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by holders of our common stock, including Tontine, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing a large number of shares into the market. Such sales, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We cannot predict whether future sales of our common stock, or the availability of our common stock for sale, will adversely affect the market price for our common stock or our ability to raise capital by offering equity securities. 
 
 Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors and customers with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks. 
 
 Investors have increased their emphasis on the environmental, social and governance ESG practices of companies across all industries, including the environmental impact of operations and human capital management. Certain stockholders use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure a company s ESG practices when deciding whether to invest in its common stock or engage with the company to require changes to its practices. In addition, our customers may evaluate our ESG practices or require that we adopt certain ESG policies as a condition of awarding contracts. 
 
 A failure to comply with investor or customer expectations and standards, which are evolving and vary considerably, or the perception that we have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, could result in reputational harm to our business and could have an adverse effect on us. 
 
 In addition, organizations that provide ratings information to investors on ESG matters may assign unfavorable ratings to IES or our industries, which may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment capital to other companies or industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our costs of capital. 
 
 Our bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers, employees or shareholders in such capacity. 
 
 Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, employee or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with 
 20 

resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under, the federal securities laws, including the Exchange Act, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 
 General Risks 
 
 Our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent all possible errors that could occur. Internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objective will be met. 
 
 On a quarterly basis, we evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures, which include a review of the objectives, design, implementation and effectiveness of the controls and the information generated for use in our periodic reports. In the course of our controls evaluation, we sought (and seek) to identify data errors, control problems and to confirm that appropriate corrective actions, including process improvements, are being undertaken. This type of evaluation is conducted on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of our controls can be reported in our periodic reports. 
 
 A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be satisfied. Internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to give reasonable assurance that they are effective and achieve their objectives. We cannot provide absolute assurance that all possible future control issues have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that our judgments can be faulty and that isolated breakdowns can occur because of human error or mistake. The design of our system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed absolutely in achieving our stated goals under all potential future or unforeseeable conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error could occur without being detected.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy 
 
 As part of the Company s overall risk management, the Company has adopted processes designed to assess, identify and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our program has been designed and evaluated based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework NIST CSF ). This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that we use NIST CSF as a guide to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business. The cybersecurity risk management program includes, among other things, processes to manage risks associated with third party service providers, regular review and testing of the Company s cybersecurity practices through audits, internal assessments and tabletop exercises, and mandatory annual cybersecurity awareness training for all employees. In addition, the Company has adopted an incident response plan establishing the processes for responding to any cybersecurity incident. The Company has engaged third party cybersecurity firms to perform maturity assessments of our cybersecurity risk management program, the results of which are reported to the Board. 
 We have experienced cybersecurity attacks and incidents in the past and could in the future experience similar attacks. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack, or any risk from cybersecurity threats, has materially affected or has been determined to be reasonably likely to materially affect the Company or our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 
 Cybersecurity Governance 
 
 Our Board oversees the Company s general risk management processes, and with respect to cybersecurity risks the oversight is performed primarily through the Audit Committee of the Board, which is briefed at least quarterly on cybersecurity threats, the results of periodic assessment and reviews of the Company s cybersecurity programs, and cybersecurity developments affecting companies generally. Our incident response plan provides for prompt notice to the Board of any material cybersecurity incident. 
 Our cybersecurity program is overseen by our head of cybersecurity, with guidance from our Chief Technical Officer and our Vice President of Information Technology. Our head of cybersecurity has more than ten years of experience managing cybersecurity 
 21 

matters, holds an undergraduate degree in information systems with a focus on information security, and holds numerous certificates across the cybersecurity landscape. Our head of cybersecurity is also responsible for providing the Audit Committee with quarterly updates on cybersecurity risks and developments.

PART II 

Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity; Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol IESC. 
 
 As of November 18, 2024, the closing market price of our common stock was 264.67 per share and there were approximately 299 holders of record. 
 
 We have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for the purchase from time to time of up to 1.5 million shares of the Company s common stock, and in 2019, authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to an additional 1.0 million shares of the Company's common stock under the stock repurchase program. In December 2022, our Board of Directors terminated our previous stock repurchase program and authorized a new 40 million stock repurchase program. In July 2024, the Company fully utilized the amount remaining under this 40 million authorization. On July 31, 2024, the Board authorized a new 200 million stock repurchase program. S hare purchases are made for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and amount of purchases under the program are determined based upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. All or part of the repurchases may be implemented under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows repurchases under pre-set terms at times when the Company might otherwise be prevented from purchasing under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed blackout periods.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 Executive Overview 
 
 Please refer to Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company s services and corporate strategy. IES Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, designs and installs integrated electrical and technology systems and provides infrastructure products and services to a variety of end markets, including data centers, residential housing, and commercial and industrial facilities. Our operations are organized into four business segments: Communications, Residential, Infrastructure Solutions and Commercial Industrial. 
 
 Industry Trends 
 
 Our performance is affected by a number of trends that drive the demand for our services. In particular, the markets in which we operate are exposed to many regional and national trends such as the demand for single and multi-family housing, the need for mission critical facilities as a result of technology-driven advancements, capital spending on data centers, distribution centers, and high-tech manufacturing facilities, demand for back-up power, output levels and equipment utilization at heavy industrial facilities, demand for our rail and infrastructure services and custom engineered products, and changes in commercial, institutional, public infrastructure and electric utility spending. Over the long term, we believe that there are numerous factors that could positively drive demand and affect growth within the industries in which we operate, including (i) population growth, which will increase the need for commercial and residential facilities, (ii) aging public infrastructure, which must be replaced or repaired, (iii) an increasing demand for data storage, and (iv) increased emphasis on environmental and energy efficiency, which may lead to increased public and private spending. However, there can be no assurance that we will not experience a decrease in demand for our services due to economic, technological or other factors beyond our control, including interest rate increases, increases in the price of copper, aluminum, steel, fuel, electrical components, certain plastics, and other commodity prices and other economic factors, which may reduce the demand for housing in the regions where our Residential division operates, and may impact levels of construction. For further discussion of the industries in which we operate, please see Item 1. Business - Operating Segments of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Business Outlook 
 
 While there are differences among the Company s segments, on an overall basis, increased demand for the Company s services and the Company s previous investment in growth initiatives and other business-specific factors discussed below resulted in aggregate year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. 
 
 Entering fiscal 2025, we see strong demand across many of our key end markets. However, our business segments each have their own unique set of factors influencing demand for our services. Heading into fiscal 2025, we are cautious about near-term demand for single-family housing as elevated mortgage rates and the impacts of inflation on materials and labor costs have resulted in a decline in housing affordability. In addition, consumer expectations about future interest rate reductions may cause some home buyers to delay purchases in anticipation of lower mortgage costs. In the multi-family business, higher borrowing costs for project owners during fiscal 2024 have resulted in a reduction in backlog at September 30, 2024 compared with September 30, 2023. This will result in lower multi-family revenues in fiscal 2025 as compared with the prior year. However, backlog across our business segments as a whole remains at record levels, reflecting strong demand in key end markets. Demand with respect to data centers, a key end market served by our Communications, Infrastructure Solutions, and Commercial Industrial segments, remains particularly strong. However, availability of labor and capacity could constrain the rate at which we are able to grow this business. 
 
 To continue to grow our business, including through acquisitions and the funding of working capital, we may require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate or otherwise access cash depends on many externally influenced factors, including demand for our services, the availability of projects at margins acceptable to us, the ultimate collectability of our receivables, our ability to borrow on our credit facility, and our ability to raise funds in the capital markets, among many other factors. We anticipate that the combination of cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available capacity under our credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs, debt service requirements and capital expenditures for property and equipment through the next 12 months. We expect our capital expenditures will range from 45 million to 55 million for the year ending on September 30, 2025. 
 
 25 

While the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on markets, the supply chain and the labor force had significantly less of an impact on our business in fiscal 2024 compared with prior fiscal years, COVID-19 and any future pandemic or other public health emergency could impact our workforce, customers and suppliers in the future. An inability to procure materials in a timely manner, to complete work on schedule, and to reflect higher materials or labor costs in our pricing to customers has had, and could have in the future, a significant impact on our operating results. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 We report our operating results across our four operating segments: Communications, Residential, Infrastructure Solutions and Commercial Industrial. Expenses associated with our corporate office are classified separately. The following table presents selected historical results of operations of IES, as well as the results of acquired businesses from the dates acquired.

 2024 Compared to 2023 
 
 Consolidated revenues for the year ended September 30, 2024, were 507.1 million higher than for the year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 21.3 , with increases at all of our operating segments. See further discussion below of changes in revenues for our individual segments. 
 
 Our overall gross profit percentage increased to 24.2 during the year September 30, 2024, as compared to 18.7 during the year ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased at all four of our operating segments. See further discussion below of changes in gross margin for our individual segments. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs not directly associated with performing work for our customers. These costs consist primarily of compensation and benefits related to corporate, business segment and branch management (including incentive-based compensation), occupancy and utilities, training, professional services, information technology costs, consulting fees, travel and certain types of depreciation and amortization. We allocate certain corporate selling, general and administrative costs across our segments as we believe this more accurately reflects the costs associated with operating each segment. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2024, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 396.7 million, an increase of 98.1 million, or 32.8 over the year ended September 30, 2023, driven by increased personnel costs, primarily at our Residential operating segment, and higher incentive compensation across our business as a result of higher earnings. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 13.8 for the year ended September 30, 2024 from 12.6 for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our results for the year ended September 30, 2023 included a pretax gain of 13.0 million from the sale of STR Mechanical, LLC STR ), which previously operated as part of our Commercial Industrial segment, on October 7, 2022.

 partially offset by a decrease at our Commercial Industrial segment. See further discussion below of changes in revenues for our 
 individual segments. 
 
 Our overall gross profit percentage increased to 18.7 during the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 14.7 during the year ended September 30, 2022.

 During the year ended September 30, 2023, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 298.6 million, an increase of 35.9 million, or 13.7 over the year ended September 30, 2022, driven by increased personnel costs, primarily at our Residential operating segment, in connection with its growth, including higher incentive compensation at the division level as a result of higher earnings. Additionally, our Residential segment recorded severance charges of 3.6 million in connection with a reorganization of its 
 management structure. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 12.6 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from 12.1 for the year ended September 30, 2022. 

Communications 
 
 2024 Compared to 2023 Year Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands, Percentage of revenues) Revenues 100.0 100.0 Cost of services 623,844 80.3 494,964 82.4 Gross Profit 19.7 17.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 65,752 8.5 54,344 9.0 (Gain) loss on sale of assets ) Operating Income 11.2 8.6 
 
 Revenue. Our Communications segment s revenues increased by 175.7 million, or 29.2 , during the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. This increase primarily resulted from increased demand from our data center, high-tech manufacturing and e-commerce distribution center customers. 
 
 Gross Profit. Our Communications segment s gross profit during the year ended September 30, 2024, increased 46.8 million, or 44.2 , as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from 17.6 for the year ended September 30, 2023 to 19.7 for the year ended September 30, 2024. The increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects increased volume, successful project execution, favorable contract pricing and the impact of a more disciplined bidding process. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our Communications segment s selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11.4 million, or 21.0 during the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023.

 53.8 , as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from 12.3 for the year 
 ended September 30, 2022 to 17.6 for the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit and gross profit as a 
 percentage of revenue partially reflects the impact of 19.9 million of project losses incurred in the year ended September 30, 2022 
 resulting from execution issues relating to an expansion into a new, adjacent service area. Although these projects continued to 
 negatively impact our results throughout fiscal 2022, we have since completed all such projects, and are no longer working in this 
 service area. Gross profit also increased as a result of an increase in revenues in the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the 
 year ended September 30, 2022 as discussed above. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our Communications segment s selling, general and administrative expenses increased 
 7.6 million, or 16.3 during the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase is 
 a result of higher personnel costs including higher incentive compensation as a result of higher earnings, investment in an 
 organizational structure that will enhance the scalability of our business, and higher wages in a competitive labor market. Selling, 
 general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in the Communications segment were 9.0 during the year ended

 Revenue. Our Residential segment s revenues increased by 109.3 million, or 8.5 , during the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an 81.0 million increase in revenues from our plumbing and HVAC business as we expanded our offerings during the year ended September 30, 2024. Our single-family electrical business continued to have strong demand as revenues increased by 14.9 million, while multi-family and other revenue increased by 13.4 million resulting from continued strong demand and successful execution of existing backlog, partially offset by a reduction in activity in certain areas as we became more selective in our bidding process.

 the impact of price increases and an easing of supply chain challenges that impacted prior year efficiency. Gross margin as a 
 percentage of revenue increased to 19.8 during the year ended September 30, 2023 from 18.0 for the year ended September 30, 
 2022, as prior year gross margins were negatively impacted by higher labor and material costs, but improved incrementally throughout

 25.6 million, or 17.8 , during the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase 
 was driven primarily by higher personnel costs in connection with business growth, including incentive profit sharing for division 
 management. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 also included the 3.6 million of 
 severance charges discussed above, as we reorganized the segment's management structure. We also incurred other discrete expenses 
 in the year ended September 30, 2023 in connection with implementing this reorganization as we began combining multiple 
 administrative facilities into a single location and consolidating several underperforming branches. Selling, general and administrative 
 expenses as a percentage of revenues in the Residential segment increased to 13.3 during the year ended September 30, 2023, from 
 12.7 during the year ended September 30, 2022.

 Revenue. Revenues in our Infrastructure Solutions segment increased by 133.7 million, or 61.5 during the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ended September 30, 2023.

Our Infrastructure Solutions segment s selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended September 30, 2024, increased 11.1 million, or 42.4 , compared to the year ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of increased employee compensation cost to support growth in the business, in part due to the acquisition of Greiner in April 2024, and increased incentive profit sharing resulting from higher earnings. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 12.1 for the year ended September 30, 2023, to 10.7 for the year ended September 30, 2024 as we benefited from the scale of our operations.

 relocation of our Tulsa, Oklahoma operation to a new, larger facility in order to accommodate increased demand for our generator 
 enclosure products. Additionally, gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2023 was positively impacted by an increase in 
 revenues from our generator enclosure business as discussed above, as well as improved operating margins in our custom engineered

Our Commercial Industrial segment s gross profit during the year ended September 30, 2024 increased by 42.9 million, or 137.1 , as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023, and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from 11.2 for the year ended September 30, 2023 to 20.2 for the year ended September 30, 2024. Segment results in the year ended September 30, 2024 benefited from favorable project execution and additions to the original scope of work at favorable margins on the large data center project, improved project execution across the business, improving bid margins in certain markets, and a more selective bidding strategy implemented in the prior year. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our Commercial Industrial segment s selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended September 30, 2024 increased 7.7 million, or 30.5 , compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by increased employee compensation cost, including higher incentive compensation as a result of higher earnings. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was 9.0 and 8.9 in the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 
 Gain on Sale of Assets . As discussed above, our results for the year ended September 30, 2023 include a pretax gain on sale of 13.0 million from the sale of STR in October 2022.

 Revenue. Revenues in our Commercial Industrial segment decreased 28.9 million, or 9.4 , during the year ended September 30, 
 2023, compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of our STR business in October 2022, 
 which contributed revenue of 18.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in revenues was also the result of a 
 planned reduction in activity at an underperforming branch where we incurred substantial losses in fiscal 2022. 
 
 Gross Profit . Our Commercial Industrial segment s gross profit during the year ended September 30, 2023 increased by 13.1 
 million, or 72.1 , as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. Gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2022 included 
 project losses of 16.7 million due to execution issues on two projects at one underperforming branch. The benefit of improved project 
 execution in 2023 was partially offset by the sale of STR in October 2022, which contributed gross profit of 4.9 million for the year 
 ended September 30, 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from 5.9 for the year ended September 30, 2022, to 
 11.2 for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our Commercial Industrial segment s selling, general and administrative expenses 
 during the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased 5.3 million, or 17.4 , compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. The 
 decrease was driven primarily by the sale of STR in October 2022, which recorded branch-level selling, general and administrative 
 expense of 4.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year 
 ended September 30, 2022 included 2.3 million of reserves in connection with legal matters related to certain contractual disputes. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 9.9 for the year ended September 30, 2022 
 to 9.0 for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Gain on Sale of Assets. As discussed above, our results for the year ended September 30, 2023 include a pretax gain on sale of 13.0 
 million from the sale of STR in October 2022. 

INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET 
 Year Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2022 (In thousands) Interest expense 1,051 2,754 2,771 Deferred financing charges 287 268 199 Total interest expense 1,338 3,022 2,970 Interest income (4,042) (564) (10) Other (income) expense, net (1,086) (1,230) 47 Total other (income) expense, net (5,128) (1,794) 37 Total interest and other (income) expense, net (3,790) 1,228 3,007 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2024, we incurred interest expense of 1.3 million primarily comprised of interest expense on our finance lease agreements and fees on an average letter of credit balance of 5.5 million under our revolving credit facility and an average unused line of credit balance of 144.5 million. The reduction in interest expense in the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ended September 30, 2023 was a result of a decrease in average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which had no outstanding balance during the year ended September 30, 2024. Total other income, net of 5.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of interest income of 4.0 million and unrealized gains on investments in trading securities of 1.8 million. 
 32 

During the year ended September 30, 2023, we incurred interest expense of 3.0 million primarily comprised of interest expense on an 
 average outstanding balance of 26.9 million under our revolving credit facility and on our finance lease agreements, in addition to 
 fees on an average letter of credit balance of 4.7 million under our revolving credit facility and an average unused line of credit 
 balance of 117.8 million. Interest expense in the year ended September 30, 2023 remained relatively consistent compared to the year 
 ended September 30, 2022 as a decrease in interest expense incurred on our revolving credit facility resulting from a lower average 
 outstanding balance was offset by an increase in interest expense related to a higher volume of active finance leases. Total other income, net of 1.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of gains on investments in equity securities of 1.0 million. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2022, we incurred interest expense of 3.0 million primarily comprised of interest expense on an average outstanding balance of 82.3 million under our revolving credit facility, in addition to fees on an average letter of credit balance of 4.5 million under our revolving credit facility and an average unused line of credit balance of 49.2 million. 

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 72.2 million, which reflects a higher pretax income than in the year ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by 5.5 million of non-cash tax benefits from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal 2024. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 38.8 million, which reflects a higher pretax income than 
 in the year ended September 30, 2022. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of 12.8 million, which reflects a 0.8 million benefit related 
 to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. 

WORKING CAPITAL 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2024, working capital exclusive of cash increased by 53.4 million from September 30, 2023, reflecting a 175.4 million increase in current assets excluding cash partially offset by a 122.0 million increase in current liabilities during the period. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2024, our current assets exclusive of cash increased to 770.9 million, as compared to 595.5 million as of September 30, 2023. An increase in activity and the timing of billings at our Communications and Infrastructure Solutions businesses, along with trade receivables acquired as part of the Greiner acquisition, drove a 106.0 million increase in trade accounts receivable and a 12.9 million increase in retainage. While the rate of collections may vary, our typically secured position, resulting from our ability in general to secure liens against our customers overdue receivables, offers some protection that collection will occur eventually to the extent that our security retains value. Additionally, marketable securities increased by 35.0 million as a portion of our excess cash during the year ended September 30, 2024 was invested in trading securities, and costs and estimated earnings in excess of contract billings increased by 11.5 million primarily from contract assets acquired as part of the Greiner acquisition. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2024, our total current liabilities increased by 122.0 million to 522.6 million, compared to 400.6 million as of September 30, 2023, driven by a 55.2 million increase in contract billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, which varies based on the timing of contract billings on projects on which revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method, and a 66.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily as a result of increased activity and the timing of payments across all of our operating segments, and an increase in income tax payable based on the timing of tax payments. 
 
 Surety 
 
 Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a surety. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of our contract and that we will pay our subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under the terms of our contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the sureties for any expenses or outlays they incur on our behalf. To date, we have not been required to make any reimbursements to our sureties for bond-related costs. 
 
 As is common in the surety industry, sureties issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time. We believe that our relationships with our sureties will allow us to provide surety bonds as they are required. However, current market conditions, as well as changes in our sureties' assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our sureties to decline to 
 33 

issue bonds for our work. If our sureties decline to issue bonds for our work, our alternatives will include posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash, seeking bonding capacity from other sureties, or engaging in more projects that do not require surety bonds. In addition, if we are awarded a project for which a surety bond is required but we are unable to obtain a surety bond, the result could be a claim for damages by the customer for the costs of replacing us with another contractor. 
 
 We believe the bonding capacity currently provided by our sureties is adequate for our current operations and will be adequate for our operations for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated cost to complete our bonded projects was approximately 133.9 million. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 100.8 million and 143.4 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. We anticipate that the combination of cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available capacity under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs, debt service requirements and capital expenditures for property and equipment through the next twelve months. Our ability to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors, including demand for our services, the availability of projects at margins acceptable to us, the ultimate collectability of our receivables, and our ability to borrow on our revolving credit facility or raise funds in the capital markets, if needed. 
 
 The Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 On April 28, 2022, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement"), which increased our maximum borrowing amount from 125 million to 150 million. The Amended Credit Agreement also removed the aggregate cap on our investments in certain securities and the cap on our ability to make stock repurchases, in each case subject to the satisfaction of certain liquidity requirements. All other customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default were unchanged by the amendment. 
 Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement may not exceed a "Borrowing Base, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, determined monthly based on available collateral, primarily certain accounts receivables, inventories, and equipment. Amounts outstanding bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the Daily Three Month Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus an interest rate margin, which is determined quarterly, based on the following thresholds: Level Thresholds 
 Interest Rate Margin 
 I If Liquidity is less than 35 of the Maximum Revolver Amount (each as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) at any time during the period 2.00 percentage points II If Liquidity is greater than or equal to 35 of the Maximum Revolver Amount at all times during the period and less than 50 of the Maximum Revolver Amount at any time during the period 1.75 percentage points III If Liquidity is greater than or equal to 50 of the Maximum Revolver Amount at all times during the period 1.50 percentage points 
 
 In addition, we are charged monthly in arrears for (1) an unused commitment fee of 0.25 per annum, (2) a collateral monitoring fee of 5 thousand per quarter, (3) a letter of credit fee based on the then-applicable interest rate margin (4) appraisal fees, costs and expenses and (5) certain other fees and charges as specified in the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement, requiring that we maintain: 
 
 a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), measured quarterly on a trailing 
 four-quarter basis at the end of each quarter, of at least 1.1 to 1.0; and 
 
 minimum Liquidity of at least 10 of the Maximum Revolver Amount, or 15.0 million; with, for purposes of this covenant, at least 50 of our Liquidity comprised of Excess Availability (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our Liquidity was 244.2 million, our Excess Availability was 143.4 million (or greater than 50 of minimum Liquidity), and our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was 3.4:1.0. 
 
 Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is calculated as follows (with capitalized terms as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement): (i) our trailing twelve month EBITDA, less Non-Financed Capital Expenditures (other than capital expenditures financed by means of an advance under the credit facility), cash taxes and all Restricted Junior Payments consisting of certain Pass-Through Tax Liabilities, divided by (ii) the sum of our cash interest (other than interest paid-in-kind, amortization of financing fees, and other non-cash interest 
 34 

expense) and principal debt payments (other than repayment of principal on advances under the credit facility and including cash payments with respect to capital leases), any management, consulting, monitoring, and advisory fees paid to an affiliate, and all Restricted Junior Payments (other than Pass-Through Tax Liabilities) and other cash distributions; provided, that if we make an acquisition consented to by our lenders, the components of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated for such fiscal period after giving pro forma effect to the acquisition assuming that such transaction has occurred on the first day of such period (including pro forma adjustments arising out of events which are directly attributable to such acquisition, are factually supportable, and are expected to have a continuing impact, in each case to be reasonably agreed to by our lenders). 
 
 As defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, EBITDA is calculated as consolidated net income (or loss), less extraordinary gains, interest income, non-operating income and income tax benefits and decreases in any change in LIFO reserves, plus stock compensation expense, non-cash extraordinary losses (including, but not limited to, a non-cash impairment charge or write-down), Interest Expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and increases in any change in LIFO reserves for such period, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 If in the future our Liquidity falls below 15.0 million (or Excess Availability falls below 50 of our minimum Liquidity), our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is less than 1.1:1.0, or if we otherwise fail to perform or otherwise comply with certain of our covenants or other agreements under the Amended Credit Agreement, it would result in an event of default under the Amended Credit Agreement, which could result in some or all of our then-outstanding indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 4.8 million in outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 Investments 
 
 From time to time, the Company invests in non-controlling positions in the debt or equity securities of other businesses. Our Board of Directors has approved an investment policy that, after taking into consideration the liquidity required to support and invest in the Company's operations, permits the Company to invest in marketable securities, including equities and fixed income securities that can be easily bought and sold on a public market, and non-marketable securities, including equity and fixed income investments in private companies as well as private investments in public companies, subject to size limits and required approvals for certain investments. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Our cash flow from operations is not only influenced by cyclicality, demand for our services, operating margins and the type of services we provide, but can also be influenced by working capital needs such as the timing of our receivable collections. Working capital needs are generally lower during our fiscal first and second quarters due to the seasonality that we experience in many regions of the country; however, a seasonal decline in working capital may be offset by needs associated with higher growth or acquisitions. 
 
 Operating activities provided net cash of 234.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 153.9 million of net cash provided in the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating cash flow resulted primarily from increased earnings partially offset by an increase in cash used in working capital during the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Operating activities provided net cash of 153.9 million during the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 16.3 million of 
 net cash provided in the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in operating cash flow resulted primarily from increased 
 earnings and a reduction in cash used in working capital during the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the year ended 
 September 30, 2022 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 108.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.8 million of net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended September 30, 2023. During the year ended September 30, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Greiner for 67.0 million. We also had capital expenditures of 45.2 million as we acquired new facilities to increase the manufacturing capacity of our Infrastructure Solutions segment's operations, purchased new assets instead of entering into new lease agreements at our Residential and Communications segments, and made other capital expenditures to support the growth of our business. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the sale of assets, including the sale of STR, provided cash of 20.6 million, which was partially offset by capital expenditures of 17.7 million. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 2.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to 29.5 million of net 
 cash used in investing activities in the year ended September 30, 2022. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the sale of assets, 
 35 

including the sale of STR, provided cash of 20.6 million, which was partially offset by 17.7 million used for capital expenditures. Investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 include 29.3 million of capital expenditures primarily related to the 
 acquisition of a new operating facility for our Wedlake business, as well as an additional facility to support the growth of our 
 Residential business in Florida. 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 100.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2024 included 44.0 million used for the repurchase of our common stock, including repurchases to satisfy statutory withholding requirements upon the vesting of employee stock compensation, 32.0 million paid to acquire the 20 percent noncontrolling interest in Bayonet Plumbing, Heating Air-Conditioning, LLC, and distributions to noncontrolling interests of 16.2 million under operating agreements in connection with certain acquisitions. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 105.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in financing activities 
 for the year ended September 30, 2023 included net repayments on our credit facility of 82.7 million, distributions to noncontrolling 
 interests of 11.5 million under operating agreements in connection with certain acquisitions, and 8.3 million used for the repurchase 
 of our common stock, including repurchases to satisfy statutory withholding requirements upon the vesting of employee stock 
 compensation. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 15.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2022. Net cash provided by financing 
 activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 included net borrowing on our credit facility of 42.3 million, partly offset by 18.6 
 million used for the repurchase of our common stock, including repurchases to satisfy statutory withholding requirements upon the 
 vesting of employee stock compensation. Additionally, we distributed 7.0 million to noncontrolling interests under operating 
 agreements in connection with certain acquisitions. 

CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER 
 
 Tontine Associates, L.L.C. ("Tontine Associates"), together with its affiliates (collectively, "Tontine") is the Company's controlling stockholder, owning approximately 55 percent of the Company s outstanding common stock based on a Form 4 filed by Tontine with the SEC on September 16, 2024 and the Company's shares outstanding as of November 18, 2024. Accordingly, Tontine has the ability to exercise significant control over our affairs, including the election of directors and most actions requiring the approval of shareholders. 
 
 The Company is a party to a sublease agreement with Tontine Associates, for corporate office space in Greenwich, Connecticut. In December 2022, the Company entered into an amendment of the sublease agreement, which was set to terminate on February 28, 2023, to extend the term of the agreement through August 31, 2024 and to increase the monthly payments from approximately 8 to approximately 9 effective March 1, 2023. On August 1, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment of the sublease agreement to extend the term of the agreement through September 30, 2025, effective September 1, 2024. Payments by the Company are at a rate consistent with that paid by Tontine Associates to its landlord. 
 
 On December 6, 2018, the Company entered into a Board Observer Letter Agreement (the "Observer Agreement") with Tontine Associates in order to assist Tontine in managing its investment in the Company. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Observer Agreement, the Company granted Tontine the right, at any time that Tontine holds at least 20 of the outstanding common stock of the Company, to appoint a representative to serve as an observer to the Board (the Board Observer ). The Board Observer, who shall serve at the discretion of and must be reasonably acceptable to those members of the Board who are not affiliates of Tontine, shall have no voting rights or other decision making authority. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Observer Agreement, so long as Tontine has the right to appoint a Board Observer, the Board Observer will have the right to attend and participate in meetings of the Board and the committees thereof, subject to confidentiality requirements, and to receive reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in his or her capacity as a Board Observer and such rights to coverage under the Company s directors and officers liability insurance policy as are available to directors.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 
 As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain off-balance sheet arrangements that expose us to increased risk. Our significant off-balance sheet transactions include letter of credit obligations, firm commitments for materials and surety guarantees. 
 
 Some of our customers and vendors may require us to post letters of credit as a means of guaranteeing performance under our contracts and ensuring payment by us to subcontractors and vendors. If our customer has reasonable cause to effect payment under a letter of credit, we would be required to reimburse our creditor for the letter of credit. 
 
 Some of the underwriters of our casualty insurance program require us to post letters of credit as collateral, as is common in the insurance industry. To date, we have not had a situation where an underwriter has had reasonable cause to effect payment under a letter of credit. At September 30, 2024, 4.8 million of our outstanding letters of credit were to collateralize our insurance programs. 
 
 From time to time, we may enter into firm purchase commitments for materials such as copper wire and aluminum wire, which we expect to use in the ordinary course of business. These commitments are typically for terms of less than one year and require us to buy minimum quantities of materials at specified intervals at a fixed price over the term. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any such firm commitments to purchase materials outstanding. 
 
 Many of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a surety. Those bonds guarantee the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. In the event that we fail to perform under a contract or pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand the surety to pay or perform under our bond. Our relationship with our sureties is such that we will indemnify the sureties for any expenses they incur in connection with any of the bonds they issue on our behalf and may be required to post collateral to support the bonds. To date, we have not incurred any material costs to indemnify our sureties for expenses they incurred on our behalf. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. We review all significant estimates affecting our Consolidated Financial Statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on our beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. 
 Accordingly, we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. We identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition, accounting for business combinations, and estimation of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits. These accounting policies, as well as others, are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. 
 
 Revenue Recognition. We enter into contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids. We frequently negotiate the final terms and prices of those contracts with the customer. Although the terms of our contracts vary considerably, approximately 90.0 of our revenues are based on either a fixed price or unit price basis in which we agree to do the work for a fixed amount for the entire project (fixed price) or for units of work performed (unit price). Approximately 10.0 of our revenues are earned from contracts where we are paid on a time and materials basis. Our most significant cost drivers are the cost of labor and materials. These costs may vary from the costs we originally estimated. Variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price and unit price contracts may result in actual revenue and gross profits or interim projected revenue and gross profits for a project differing from those we originally estimated and could result in losses on projects. Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year. 
 
 We complete most of our projects within one year. We frequently provide service and maintenance work under open-ended, unit price master service agreements which are renewable annually. We recognize revenue on service, time and material work when services are performed. Work performed under a construction contract generally provides that the customers accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for services rendered, measured in terms of units installed, hours expended or some other measure of progress. Revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Revenues recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, all of which are fixed price or cost plus arrangements, comprised approximately 55 of our total revenue for the 
 37 

year ended September 30, 2024. The percentage-of-completion method for construction contracts is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion. We generally consider contracts substantially complete upon departure from the work site and acceptance by the customer. Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated contract costs, profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income, and the effects of such revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. 
 
 We generally do not incur significant costs related to obtaining contracts, or initial set-up or mobilization costs, prior to the start of a project. When significant pre contract costs are incurred, they will be capitalized and amortized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the contract. 
 
 The current asset Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed that management believes will be billed and collected within the next twelve months. The current liability Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents billings in excess of revenues recognized. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings are amounts considered recoverable from customers based on different measures of performance, including achievement of specific milestones, completion of specified units or completion of the contract. Also included in this asset, from time to time, are claims and unapproved change orders, which include amounts that we are in the process of collecting from our customers or agencies for changes in contract specifications or design, contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to scope and price, or other related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs. Variable consideration, including claims and unapproved change orders, is estimated at probability weighted value we expect to receive (or the most probable amount we expect to incur in the case of liquidated damages, if any), utilizing estimation methods that best predict the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled (or will be incurred in the case of liquidated damages, if any). We do not recognize profits on construction costs incurred in connection with claims. Claims made by us involve negotiation and, in certain cases, litigation. Such litigation costs are expensed as incurred. 
 
 Business Combinations . In accounting for business combinations, certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired, evaluating the fair value of liabilities assumed, as well as in determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit. These estimates may be affected by factors such as changing market conditions affecting the industries in which we operate. The most significant assumptions requiring judgment involve identifying and estimating the fair value of intangible assets and the associated useful lives for establishing amortization periods. To finalize purchase accounting for significant intangible assets and liabilities, we utilize the services of independent valuation specialists to assist in the determination of the fair value. 
 
 Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets. We regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain. We perform this evaluation quarterly. The estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024, we concluded, based upon the assessment of positive and negative evidence, that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its 22.5 million of deferred tax assets. We considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. 
 An inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize our deferred tax assets may lead to a future need for a valuation allowance and a corresponding reduction in GAAP net income. In addition, any reduction in the federal statutory tax rate in the future could also cause a reduction in the economic benefit of the deferred tax assets available to us and a corresponding charge to reduce the book value of the deferred tax asset recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Income Taxes. GAAP specifies the methodology by which a company must identify, recognize, measure and disclose in its financial statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting positions that it has taken or expects to take. GAAP requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. 
 The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step is the recognition process to determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit/expense to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit/expense that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 
 The tax years ended September 30, 2021 and forward are subject to federal audit as are prior tax years, to the extent of unutilized net operating losses generated in those years. 
 38 

We anticipate that approximately 10.8 million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, may be reversed in the next twelve months. This reversal is predominantly due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation for unrecognized tax benefits.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques. Our exposure to significant market risks includes fluctuations in labor costs and commodity prices for copper, aluminum, steel and fuel. Commodity price risks may have an impact on our results of operations due to the fixed price nature of many of our contracts. We are exposed to market price volatility as the fair value of our investments in marketable securities may fluctuate in response to changes in market value of such securities. We are also exposed to interest rate risk with respect to any debt obligations we may incur on our credit facility. For additional information see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Commodity Risk 
 
 Our exposure to significant market risks includes fluctuations in commodity prices including, but not limited to, copper, aluminum, steel, electrical components, fuel, and certain plastics. Commodity price risks may have an impact on our results of operations due to the fixed nature of many of our contracts. Over the long-term, we expect to be able to pass along a portion of these costs to our customers, as market conditions in the construction industry will allow. 
 
 Investment Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market price volatility for our investments in marketable securities which are carried at fair value measured using market prices, with gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Changes in the market value of these investments could create volatility in our reported earnings from period to period, and a decline in value of our investments could have an adverse impact on our reported earnings. Changes in market value of investments measured at fair value resulted in an unrealized gain of 1.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in marketable securities with a fair value of 35.0 million, and a 10 change in the market value of these investments would cause a 3.5 million impact to our pre-tax income. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market interest rates. All of the long-term debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility is structured on floating rate terms. We currently do not maintain any hedging contracts that would limit our exposure to variable rates of interest when we have outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The Amended Credit Agreement uses SOFR as the benchmark for establishing the interest rate charged on our borrowings. If SOFR were to increase, our interest payment obligations on any then-outstanding borrowings would increase, having a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition. We had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024.

 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of IES Holdings, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IES Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income , stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Revenue recognition for certain fixed-price construction contracts Description of the Matter As described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company principally recognizes revenue on construction contracts over time using costs incurred as a percentage of estimated total costs at completion to determine the extent of progress toward satisfying performance obligations. The extent of progress is applied to the contract transaction price, which may include variable consideration associated with unapproved change orders, customer claims and incentives. 
 Revenue recognition under this method is subject to judgment as the determination of progress towards completion requires management to prepare estimates of the transaction price and total project costs to complete. 
 Auditing management s estimates for certain projects structured under fixed-price arrangements, and which are larger in size and longer in duration, was complex and subjective, requiring considerable judgment to evaluate management s determination of variable consideration, specifically as it related to the impact of reductions in scope and potential customer claims. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s estimating process, including controls over management s review of significant inputs and judgments with respect to the measurement of variable consideration. 
 Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating appropriate application of the Company s revenue recognition method; testing significant assumptions used to develop the estimated transaction price; and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. To assess the reasonableness of management s estimated transaction price, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, agreeing the estimate to supporting documentation; conducting interviews with project personnel; attending select project review meetings; and performing retrospective review.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of IES Holdings, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited IES Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, IES Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Greiner Industries, Inc., which is included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 6 and 12 of total and net assets, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and 1 of both revenues and net income for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Greiner Industries, Inc. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 In calculating our expected credit losses, we consider trade receivables, retainage, and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, all of which constitute a homogenous portfolio, and therefore, to measure the expected credit loss, they are grouped together. 
 
 We have elected to calculate an expected credit loss based on loss rates from historical data. Each segment groups financial assets with similar risk characteristics and collectively assesses the expected credit losses. If an individual asset experiences credit deterioration to the extent the credit risk is no longer characteristic of the other assets in the group, it will be analyzed individually. The loss rates for our portfolios include our history of credit loss expense, the aging of our receivables, our expectation of payments and adjustment for forward-looking factors specific to the macroeconomic trends in the markets we serve. 

. We considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If actual future taxable income is different from these estimates, our results could be affected. 
 
 We record reserves for income taxes related to certain tax positions when management considers it more likely than not that additional taxes may be due in excess of amounts reflected on income tax returns filed. When recording these reserves, we assume that taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. We continually review exposure to additional tax obligations, and as further information is known or events occur, changes in tax reserves may be recorded. To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and included in the provision for income taxes.

percent interest in each of the entities, with the remaining percent interest in each such entity being retained by the respective third party sellers. The interests retained by those third party sellers are identified on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncontrolling interest, classified outside of permanent equity. Under the terms of each entity s operating agreement, after five years from the date of the acquisition, we may elect to purchase, or the third party seller may require us to purchase, part or all of the remaining percent interest in the applicable entity. The purchase price is variable, based on a multiple of earnings as defined in the operating agreements. Therefore, this noncontrolling interest is carried at the greater of the balance determined under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 810 and the redemption amounts assuming the noncontrolling interests were redeemable at the balance sheet date. 
 On June 28, 2024, we purchased the remaining 20 percent noncontrolling interest in Bayonet for 32,000. As we retained our controlling interest in Bayonet, the change in ownership interest was accounted for as an equity transaction. The difference between the balance of the noncontrolling interest at the date of redemption of the remaining interests and the consideration paid was recognized in Additional Paid-In Capital in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and was not reflected in earnings. 
 If all of the noncontrolling interests remaining outstanding at September 30, 2024 had been redeemable at that date, the redemption amount would have been .

percent of the Company s outstanding common stock based on a Form 4 filed by Tontine with the SEC on September 16, 2024 and the Company's shares outstanding as of November 18, 2024. Accordingly, Tontine has the ability to exercise significant control over our affairs, including the election of directors and most actions requiring the approval of shareholders. 
 
 While Tontine is subject to certain restrictions under federal securities laws on sales of its shares as an affiliate, the Company has filed a resale shelf registration statement to register for resale a majority of the shares of IES common stock owned by Tontine. As long as the resale shelf registration statement remains effective and the Company remains eligible to use it, Tontine has the ability to resell any or all of its registered shares from time to time in one or more offerings, as described in the resale shelf registration statement and in any prospectus supplement filed in connection with an offering pursuant to the resale shelf registration statement. 
 
 Should Tontine, or its underlying individual owners, sell or otherwise dispose of all or a significant portion of its position in IES, a change in ownership of IES could occur. A change of control would trigger the change of control provisions in a number of our material agreements, including our credit agreement, bonding agreements with our sureties and our executive severance plan.

 Accounts receivable include amounts which we have billed or have an unconditional right to bill our customers. As of September 30, 2024, accounts receivable included of unbilled receivables for which we have an unconditional right to bill. 
 
 Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 
 Project contracts typically provide for a schedule of billings on percentage of completion of specific tasks inherent in the fulfillment of our performance obligation(s). The schedules for such billings usually do not precisely match the schedule on which costs are incurred. As a result, contract revenue recognized in the statement of operations can and usually does differ from amounts that can be billed to the customer at any point during the contract. Amounts by which cumulative contract revenue recognized on a contract as of a given date exceeds cumulative billings and unbilled receivables to the customer under the contract are reflected as a current asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheets under the caption Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings . Amounts by which cumulative billings to the customer under a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative contract revenue recognized are reflected as a current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets under the caption Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings . 
 
 During the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenue of and related to our contract liabilities at October 1, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 We did have any impairment losses recognized on our receivables or contract assets for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 
 Remaining performance obligations represent the unrecognized revenue value of our contract commitments. New awards represent the total expected revenue value of new contract commitments undertaken during a given period, as well as additions to the scope of existing contract commitments. Our new performance obligations vary significantly each reporting period based on the timing of our major new contract commitments. At September 30, 2024, we had remaining performance obligations of . The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the remaining recognized thereafter.

 The Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 On April 28, 2022 we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement"), which, among other things, increased the maximum borrowing amount under our revolving credit facility from to . The Amended Credit Agreement also removed the aggregate cap on Company investments in certain securities and the cap on the Company s ability to make stock repurchases, in each case subject to the satisfaction of certain liquidity requirements. The Amended Credit Agreement, which matures on September 30, 2026, contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement, requiring that we maintain:

 In fiscal 2024 and 2023, the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets increased by and decreased by , respectively, which is included in Provision for income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had available approximately of federal net tax operating loss carry forward for federal income tax purposes. This carry forward, which may provide future tax benefits, is subject to an annual limitation of under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and will begin to expire in 2029. As of September 30, 2024, we had available approximately state net tax operating loss carry forwards, including from net operating losses on which no tax benefit has been recognized and has not been recorded as a deferred tax asset. The significant majority of these carry forwards, which may provide future tax benefits, will not begin to expire until 2026. We have provided valuation allowances on all net operating losses where it is determined it is more likely than not that they will expire without being utilized. 
 
 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024, we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible. As a result, we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of our remaining deferred tax assets and need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis. 
 
 GAAP requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step is the recognition process to determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit/expense to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit/expense that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would result in a decrease in the provision for income tax expense. We anticipate that approximately in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, primarily from net operating losses on which no tax benefit has been recognized, may be reversed in the next twelve months. The reversal is predominantly due to the expiration of the statutes of limitation for unrecognized tax benefits. 
 
 We had approximately and accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of the provision for income taxes.

 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan, of which approximately shares were available for issuance at September 30, 2024. 
 
 We measure and record compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on the fair value of the awards granted at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock awards and phantom stock unit awards is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of IES s common stock on the date of grant. For awards vesting upon achievement of a market condition, the likelihood of achieving that market condition is considered in determining the fair value of the grant, which we expense ratably over the vesting period. For awards vesting upon achievement of a performance condition, we record expense based on the grant date fair value when it becomes probable the performance condition will be achieved. Forfeitures are recorded in the period in which they occur. The resulting compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. 
 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 
 In 2015, our Board authorized a stock repurchase program for the purchase from time to time of up to million shares of the Company s common stock, and in 2019, our Board authorized the repurchase from time to time of an additional million shares of the Company's common stock under the stock repurchase program. In December 2022, our Board of Directors terminated our previous stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program.

We also repurchased shares of common stock on the open market pursuant to our stock repurchase program. During the year ended September 30, 2024, we issued shares of treasury stock to satisfy the exercise of outstanding options, of which shares were repurchased to pay the exercise price of options. We had outstanding unexercised stock options remaining as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, we issued shares of treasury stock to employees and repurchased shares of common stock from our employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of certain performance phantom stock units under the Equity Incentive Plan. We also repurchased shares of common stock on the open market pursuant to our stock repurchase program, and 266 shares of restricted stock awards were forfeited by former employees and returned to treasury stock. During the year ended September 30, 2023, we issued unrestricted shares to satisfy the exercise of outstanding options.

 Director Phantom Stock Units 
 
 Director phantom stock units Director PSUs are primarily granted to the members of the Board of Directors as part of their overall compensation. These Director PSUs are contractual rights to receive one share of the Company's common stock and are paid via unrestricted stock grants to each director upon their departure from the Board of Directors.

Because these accruals are based on judgment and estimates, and involve variables that are inherently uncertain, such as the outcome of litigation and an assessment of insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not be higher or lower than such estimates. 
 
 Some of the underwriters of our casualty insurance program require us to post letters of credit as collateral. This is common in the insurance industry.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s Management and Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 framework). Based on this assessment, our management determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In conducting management s evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting, we have excluded Greiner Industries, Inc. because it was acquired during the year ended September 30, 2024. Greiner's operations accounted for 6 and 12 of our total and net assets, respectively, at September 30, 2024, and 1 of both our consolidated revenues and our net income for the year then ended. 
 
 Ernst Young LLP (PCAOB No. 42), an independent registered public accounting firm that has audited the Company s financial statements as of and for the three-year period ended September 30, 2024 , has issued a report on their audit of management s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

During the three months ended , 2024 , none of the Company s directors or officers or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.

IES HOLDINGS, INC. INSIDER TRADING POLICY 
 Directors, officers and employees of IES Holdings, Inc. (the Company who possess material information about the Company that has not been disclosed publicly material non-public information are subject to legal obligations with respect to their personal use or disclosure of such information. Violations of these obligations can result in criminal prosecution and civil proceedings against both the individual and the Company. The purpose of this Insider Trading Policy is to summarize the laws and regulations applicable to the use and disclosure of material non-public information and to set forth the Company s policies with respect to trading in the Company s securities, including the Company s common stock (the Company s securities ). 
 This Insider Trading Policy applies to (i) all directors, officers and employees of the Company (including the Company s direct and indirect subsidiaries), (ii) the Company s contractors and consultants who may, as a result of their position with the Company, have access to material non-public information, and (iii) all immediate family members of, persons sharing a household with and entities that are controlled by each of the foregoing. 
 
 INSIDER TRADING AND TIPPING 
 The personal use or disclosure of material non-public information is prohibited by the securities laws and is a violation of this Insider Trading Policy and the Company's Conflict of Interest Policy. A basic tenet of the securities laws is that persons with material non-public information regarding a company should not take advantage of such information by trading in the company s securities, unless and until such information is made available to other members of the investing public. Disclosing such information to others, including relatives or friends, a practice known as tipping, is also prohibited by the securities laws. Until material non-public information is made public, it must be used only for Company business purposes and not for anyone's personal benefit. 

PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS 
 Any director, officer, employee, contractor or consultant who possesses material non-public information is prohibited from trading in the Company s securities and from tipping such information to others. 
 
 In addition, any director, officer, employee, contractor or consultant who, as a result of his or her position with the Company, has access to material non-public information regarding another company, such as a customer or supplier, is prohibited from trading in the securities of such other company and from disclosing such information to others. Particular care should be exercised with respect to third-party information that is learned or developed in the course of a potential acquisition by the Company. 
 
 Speculative trading, such as in-and-out trading, is discouraged as a matter of policy. Accordingly, the Company s directors, officers, and employees are prohibited from engaging in short sales (the sale of securities not owned) and sales against the box (the sale of securities owned but not delivered against the sale) of any of the Company s securities. Similarly, the Company s directors, officers, and employees are prohibited from purchasing or selling puts or calls or otherwise trading in or writing options on any of the Company's securities. 

1 

TRADING WINDOWS 
 
 To promote compliance with the trading prohibitions described above, it is the Company's policy that (i) all directors and officers of the Company, (ii) any Company employees who hold a controller's position, (iii) any Company employees who work in the Company s headquarters in Houston or Greenwich and (iv) certain other designated employees who shall be notified from time to time by the Company s General Counsel that they are restricted (collectively, the Restricted Group may only trade in the Company's securities (including gifts) during designated open trading windows. 
 
 Open trading windows begin after the second full trading day following the release of the Company s annual or quarterly financial results and end two weeks prior to the end of the quarter (each, an open window ). Trading windows close two weeks prior to the end of each quarter and remain closed through the end of the second full trading day following the release of the Company s annual or quarterly financial results (each, a closed window or quarterly blackout period ). 
 
 In addition, from time to time, an event may occur during an open window that is material to the Company that is known by only by the Company s directors and officers and a limited number of employees. So long as the event remains material and non-public, those persons designated by the Company s General Counsel as having access to information regarding the event may not trade in the Company s securities (a special blackout period ). The existence of a special blackout period will not be announced instead, the existence of a special blackout period will be made known only to those directors, officers and employees who are aware of the event giving rise to, and are subject to, the special blackout. If you are notified of a special blackout period, then you may not disclose the existence of the special blackout period, or the event giving rise to the special blackout period, to any other person. 
 
 TRADING REQUESTS 
 
 In addition to only being permitted to trade in the Company s securities during open windows, members of the Restricted Group Insiders are required to request advance written approval from the Company s General Counsel prior to trading in the Company s securities (a trading request ). Each trading request should be submitted to the Company s General Counsel at least two business days prior to the date of the proposed transaction. 
 
 No trading request shall be approved at any time management believes the Insider requesting the trade may be deemed to be in possession of material non-public information. If the Insider requesting the trade becomes aware of material non-public information regarding the Company before the trade is executed, then the preclearance shall be void and the trade must not be completed. 

RULE 10b5-1 PLANS 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing prohibitions and restrictions, an Insider may be permitted to trade in the Company s securities while in possession of material non-public information or during a closed window, if such trades are made pursuant to a written plan that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (a Rule 10b5-1 Plan ). To be effective, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must meet the following requirements 

2 

The plan must be in entered into during an open window , while the Insider is not in possession of any material non-public information. 
 
 The plan must either (i) specify (or include a written formula, algorithm or computer program for determining) the amount of Company securities to be purchased or sold, the price at which Company securities are to be traded, and the dates on which trades are to be made or (2) delegate discretion on these matters to an independent third party. 
 
 The plan must include a required cooling-off period before which trading can commence under the plan. 
 
 For directors and officers, the minimum cooling-off period shall end on the later of (i) 90 days after the adoption (or modification) of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan or (ii) two business days following the disclosure of the Company s financial results in an SEC periodic report for the fiscal quarter in which the plan was adopted, provided that the maximum required cooling-off period is 120 days after adoption of the plan. 
 
 For Insiders other than directors or officers, the minimum cooling-off period shall end 30 days after the adoption (or modification) of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan. 
 
 For directors and officers, the plan must include a representation that the Insider (i) is not aware of any material nonpublic information and (ii) is adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions in Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Rule 10b-5 ). 
 
 Once the plan is adopted, the Insider must not (i) exercise any influence over the plan , including with respect to how, when, or whether to effect trades under the plan, (ii) alter or deviate from the plan (whether by changing the amount, price, or timing of trades), or (iii) enter into or alter a corresponding or hedging transaction or position with respect to the Company s securities. 
 
 An Insider may not enter into overlapping Rule 10b5-1 Plans and may only enter into one single-trade Rule 10b5-1 Plan during any 12-month period , in each case, subject to certain exceptions. 
 
 In addition to the foregoing, it is the Company s policy that (i) a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must meet all then-applicable requirements of the SEC s rules and regulations, including the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act (ii) a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be entered into in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b-5 and (iii) an Insider that adopts a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must at all times act in good faith with respect to the plan. 

PRE-APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS 
 Any adoption, modification or termination of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be approved in advance by the Company s General Counsel. A new Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be submitted to the Company s General Counsel not less than 5 business days prior to the desired date of adoption, and an amendment to a previously approved Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be submitted not less than 5 business days prior to the desired date of amendment. Once a Rule 10b5-1 Plan is approved by the Company s General Counsel, transactions effected under the plan will not require further clearance. 

3 

WHAT IS MATERIAL INFORMATION 
 
 Information is considered material if a reasonable investor would consider the information to be important in making a decision to buy, hold or sell the Company s securities or, in hindsight, if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would have viewed the information as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available by the Company. Any information that could reasonably be expected to affect the Company s stock price, whether it is positive or negative, should be considered material. There is no bright-line standard for determining materiality instead, materiality is based on an assessment of all of the facts and circumstances with the benefit of hindsight. If you are uncertain whether information is material, then you should assume it is, unless the Company s General Counsel advises you otherwise. 
 
 EXAMPLES OF MATERIAL INFORMATION 
 While it is not possible to define all categories of material information, the following are some examples of information that generally would be regarded as material. This list is not meant to be exclusive, and other categories of information not included may also be material 
 Annual or quarterly financial results. 
 Operating reports. 
 Financial projections. 
 Earnings estimates or changes in previously announced earnings estimates. 
 Operating plans and projections. 
 Mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. 
 A significant new contract or customer. 
 A significant expansion or curtailment of operations. 
 Entering into a new line of business. 

Financing transactions. 
 Securities offerings. 
 Purchases or redemptions of the Company s securities. 
 Liquidity problems or bankruptcy proceedings. 
 Significant changes in management. 
 Stock splits and stock dividends. 
 Significant cost savings initiatives. 
 Significant related party transactions. 
 Significant litigation exposure due to actual or threatened litigation. 

Developments in outstanding significant litigation. 
 Regulatory violations and regulatory or governmental inquiries or investigations. 
 Any other factors that could cause the Company s financial results to be substantially different from analysts estimates. 

WHAT IS NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION 
 Information that has not been disclosed to the public is consider to be non-public information. For information to be disclosed to the public, the information must be broadly disseminated in a manner sufficient to ensure its availability to the investing public generally , without favoring any special person or group. Information generally will be considered to have been broadly disseminated if it has been disclosed through a method that is reasonably designed to effect a broad and non-exclusionary distribution to the public. 
 The Company can broadly disseminate material information by disclosing the information in a Form 8-K or other disclosure document that is filed with the SEC and available on the SEC s website and or by issuing a press release, posting the information on the Company s website, announcing the information at a press conference or on a conference call of which the public had advance notice and to which the public was given access either in person, by telephonic transmission or by other electronic transmission (including use of the Internet).

TRADING AFTER DISCLOSURE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION 
 Once material information is broadly disseminated, it is still necessary to allow the investing public sufficient time to absorb the information before the information is considered public. For purposes of insider trading law, you must wait a reasonable time after the disclosure of material non-public information to begin trading. What constitutes a reasonable time will depend on the facts and circumstances. As a general rule, once material non-public information is released, it takes two full trading days for the market to fully absorb the information. For example, if the Company issues a press release disclosing material non-public information after the market closes on Monday, then you should not trade in the Company s securities until the market opens on Thursday. Alternatively, if the Company issues a press release before the market opens on Monday, then you may begin trading in the Company s securities when the market opens on Wednesday. Depending on the circumstances, the Company may determine that a longer or shorter period should apply. If you are unsure if a reasonable time has elapsed after the disclosure of material non-public information, then contact the Company s General Counsel. 
 
 CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATIONS 
 The purchase or sale of securities while aware of material non-public information, or the disclosure of material non-public information to others who then trade in the subject company s securities, is prohibited by federal and applicable state securities laws. Insider trading violations are pursued vigorously by the SEC, U.S. Attorneys and applicable state enforcement authorities, among others. Punishment for insider trading violations is severe, and could include significant fines and imprisonment. While the regulatory authorities concentrate their efforts on the individuals who trade, or who tip inside information to others who trade, the federal securities laws also impose potential liability on companies and other controlling persons if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading by Company employees. In addition, an individual s failure to comply with this Insider Trading Policy may subject the individual to Company disciplinary action up to and including dismissal for cause, whether or not the employee s failure to comply results in a violation of law. A violation of law, or even an SEC investigation that does not result in prosecution, can tarnish a person s reputation and irreparably damage a career. Accordingly, the Company strongly urges all persons covered by this Insider Trading Policy to strictly comply with its terms. 
 
 REPORTING VIOLATIONS 
 Any director, officer or employee who violates this Insider Trading Policy or any federal or state securities laws, including laws that prohibit insider trading or tipping, or who knows of any such violation by any other person, must report the violation immediately to the Company s General Counsel. Upon learning of any such violation, the Company s General Counsel, in consultation with the appropriate members of senior management and the Company s outside legal counsel, will determine whether a violation has occurred, and if a violation is determined to have occurred, what response is appropriate. 
 
 WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF DOUBT 
 If you are uncertain whether information is material or whether it has been publicly disclosed, then you should assume such information is material non-public information and you should not trade in the Company s securities or disclose the information outside of the Company, until you receive clearance from the Company s General Counsel. If you are ever in doubt, or if you are unsure if a violation has occurred, then contact the Company s General Counsel immediately. 
 Please direct all inquiries regarding any of the provisions or procedures set forth in this Insider Trading Policy to the Company s General Counsel.

IES HOLDINGS, INC. 
 INCENTIVE AWARD RECOUPMENT POLICY 
 This INCENTIVE AWARD RECOUPMENT POLICY (this Policy is adopted as of October 2, 2023 (the Effective Date ), by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board of IES Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (our Company ). 
 
 WHEREAS , Section 304 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 Section 304 requires the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of our Company to reimburse our Company for certain Incentive Compensation either receives (including profits they realize on the sale of our Company s securities) during the 12-month period preceding a required restatement of our Company s audited financial statements that resulted from their respective Misconduct 
 
 WHEREAS , the applicable recoupment provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd-Frank are broader than Section 304 and will become effective with respect to certain Incentive Compensation that is Received by a Covered Individual on or after October 2, 2023 and 
 
 WHEREAS , the Committee believes it would be in the best interests of our Company's shareholders to have this Policy adopted by the Committee. 
 
 NOW THEREFORE , the applicable provisions of this Policy are as follows 
 
 1. Definitions . Except as otherwise provided above, terminology used in this Policy shall have the following meanings 
 
 (a) Accounting Restatement means a requirement that the Company prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. Changes to the Company s financial statements that do not represent error corrections are not an Accounting Restatement, including (i) retrospective application of a change in accounting principle (ii) retrospective revision to reportable segment information due to a change in the structure of the Company s internal organization (iii) retrospective reclassification due to a discontinued operation (iv) retrospective application of a change in reporting entity, such as from a reorganization of entities under common control and (v) retrospective revision for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends or other changes in capital structure. 
 
 (b) Covered Individual shall mean differently depending upon whether the reference to Covered Individual relates to the Dodd-Frank clawback or the Section 304 clawback. For purposes of the Dodd-Frank clawback set forth in Section 2(a) of this Policy, the 
 -1- 

term Covered Individual means, both former and current, the (i) named executive officers of our Company (ii) each executive officer of our Company (as such term is defined under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and (iii) any officer of our Company or any of its subsidiaries that is designated by the Committee as being subject to this Policy. For purposes of the Section 304 clawback set forth in Section 3(b) of this Policy, the term Covered individual means the current Chief Executive Officer and or current Chief Financial Officer of the Company. 
 
 (c) Erroneously Awarded Compensation means the amount of Incentive Compensation that was Received that exceeds the amount of Incentive Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had the amount of Incentive Compensation been determined based on the restated Financial Reporting Measures, computed without regard to any taxes paid by the Covered Individual or by the Company on the Covered Individual s behalf. For Incentive Compensation based on total shareholder return or Company stock price, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation will be based on a reasonable estimate by the Committee of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received. The Company will maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to NASDAQ as required. 
 
 (d) Financial Reporting Measures means (i) measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures (whether or not such measures are presented within the Company s financial statements or included in a filing made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), (ii) Company stock price and (iii) Company total shareholder return. 
 
 (e) Incentive Compensation shall mean a Covered Individual's cash bonus awarded under our Company's annual incentive plan and any equity-based awards granted pursuant to our Company's long-term incentive plans that are earned, paid granted or vested wholly (or in part) upon the attainment of any Financial Reporting Measure of our Company. 
 
 (f) Look-Back Period shall have different meaning depending upon whether the reference to Look-Back Period relates to the Dodd-Frank clawback or the Section 304 clawback. For purposes of the Dodd-Frank clawback set forth in Section 2(a) of this Policy, the Look-Back Period shall mean the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the earlier of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. And too, if there is a change in the Company s fiscal year end, the Look-Back Period will also include any transition period to the extent required by Section 303A.14. In contrast, for purposes of the Section 304 clawback set forth in Section 2(b) of this 
 -2- 

Policy, the Look-Back Period shall mean the 12-month period immediately preceding the date on which the Company files full or partial restated financial statements with the Securities Exchange Commission. 
 
 (g) Received shall mean, with respect to Incentive Compensation of a Covered Individual, the fiscal year to which the Financial Reporting Measure is attained, irrespective of whether the Incentive Compensation is subject to additional time or non-financial performance vesting conditions. 
 
 2. Recoupment of Incentive Compensation Restatement of Financial Statements . 
 
 (a) Dodd-Frank Clawback . Subject to the terms of this Policy and the requirements of Section 303A.14, if the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, then the Company shall recover, reasonably promptly from each Covered Individual as set forth in Section 5 below, any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was Received by such Covered Individual during the Look-Back Period. Any amounts otherwise recoverable by the Company under this Section 2(a) shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by any amounts recoverable by the Company under Section 2(b) of this Policy. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Policy shall be deemed automatically and unilaterally amended to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the applicable listing standards to which the Company is listed. 
 
 (b) Section 304 Clawback . In the event the Company is required to restate its financial statements as the result of Misconduct of a Covered Individual, then such Covered Individual that engaged in the Misconduct must reimburse the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was Received by him or her during the Look-Back Period. For purposes of this Section 2(b), the term Misconduct shall mean fraud, intentional misconduct, gross negligence or a material violation of the Company s code of ethics or insider trading policy or any other policies or regulations of the Company governing the conduct of its employees, as determined in the reasonable discretion of the Committee. 
 
 3. Committee Discretion . The Committee may, in determining appropriate remedial action, take into account the financial cost of penalties or punishments imposed by third parties, such as law enforcement agencies, regulators or other authorities however, such determinations shall not mitigate or eliminate the Company s obligations to clawback Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to Section 2 of this Policy. 
 
 4. Amendment, Termination and Interpretation . The Committee may at any time suspend, amend or terminate this Policy to the minimum extent necessary to comply with applicable laws. Pursuant to Section 5, below, the Committee shall have the sole discretion to interpret and enforce this Policy. To that end, this Policy shall be interpreted to be automatically amended to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the provisions of the Dodd-Frank clawback and the Section 304 clawback. 
 
 -3- 

5. Enforcement and Impracticability . The Committee shall recover any Incentive Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such recovery would be impracticable, as determined by the Committee in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the listing standards of the national securities exchange on which the Company s securities are listed. To the extent the Committee determines to enforce recoupment, (i) the Committee shall provide the Covered Individual written notice of its intent to recoup Incentive Compensation under this Policy, along with the timeline within which the Covered Individual must respond, (ii) to the extent the Covered Individual does not intend to comply with such recoupment efforts, he or she must respond to the Committee in writing detailing the reasons why non-compliance is warranted and such response must be provided to the Committee within fifteen (15) business days from the Covered Individual receiving the Committee s initial notice, and (iii) if the Committee disagrees with the Covered Individual s assertions, then the Committee must respond to the Covered Individual in writing detailing such reasons within the fifteen (15) business days immediately following its receipt of the Covered Individual s written response. 
 
 6. Determination of Means of Recovery . With respect to recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation and subject to the requirement that recovery be made reasonably promptly, the Committee will determine the appropriate means of recovery, which may vary, without limitation, between Covered Individuals or based on the nature of the applicable Incentive Compensation, and which may involve, without limitation, establishing a deferred repayment plan or set off against current or future compensation otherwise payable to the Covered Person. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation will be made without regard to income taxes paid by the Covered Individual or by the Company on the Covered Individual s behalf in connection with such Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 
 
 7. Compensation Not Subject to this Policy . Section 2(a) of this Policy does not apply to Incentive-Compensation that was Received before October 2, 2023, and does not apply to Incentive Compensation that was Received by a Covered Individual before beginning service as an Executive Officer. 
 
 8. No Indemnification or Company-Paid Insurance . The Company will not indemnify or reimburse any Covered Individual against or for the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation and will not pay or reimburse any Covered Individual for the purchase of a third-party insurance policy to fund potential recovery obligations. 
 
 9. Effective Date . This Policy shall apply to all Covered Individuals from and after the Effective Date with respect to the Dodd-Frank clawback under Section 2(a) of this Policy, and with respect to the Section 304 clawback under Section 2(b) of this Policy, as required by applicable law.
