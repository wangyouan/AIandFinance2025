PAR T I 
 Item 1 . Business. 
 General 
 SR Bancorp, Inc. SR Bancorp, Inc. SR Bancorp or the Company is a Maryland chartered company and the holding company for Somerset Regal Bank (the Bank ). SR Bancorp s primary business activity is the ownership of the outstanding common stock of Somerset Regal Bank. SR Bancorp does not own or lease any property but instead uses the premises, equipment and other property of Somerset Regal Bank with the payment of appropriate rental fees, as required by applicable law and regulations, under the terms of an expense allocation agreement. 
 At June 30, 2024, SR Bancorp had total assets of 1.02 billion, deposits of 807.1 million and total equity of 199.5 million. 
 The Company became the holding company for Somerset Regal Bank as part of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Somerset Savings Bank, SLA as described below. However, as of June 30, 2023, the conversion had not been completed. Accordingly, the financial and other information contained in this document at and for the year ended June 30, 2023 is for Somerset Savings Bank, SLA, unless indicated otherwise. 
 In the future, SR Bancorp may acquire or organize other entities or operating subsidiaries; however, there are no current plans, arrangements, agreements or understandings, written or oral, to do so. 
 Our website address is www.somersetregalbank.com. We plan to make available on our website, free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Information on our website should not be considered a part of this document. 
 Somerset Regal Bank. Somerset Regal Bank was formed through the combination on September 19, 2023 of Somerset Bank and Regal Bank, two New Jersey chartered institutions. The Bank operates from 14 branches in Essex, Hunterdon, Hudson, Livingston, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union counties in the northern and central New Jersey. The Bank offers a variety of deposit and loan products to individuals and small businesses, most of which are located in our primary market. 
 Completed Stock Offering 
 On September 19, 2023, Somerset Savings Bank, SLA converted from the mutual to stock form of organization and SR Bancorp completed its stock offering. SR Bancorp sold 9,055,172 shares of its common stock at a price of 10.00 per share, which included 760,364 shares sold to Somerset Regal Bank s Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Additionally, the Company contributed 452,758 shares and 905,517 in cash to the Somerset Regal Charitable Foundation, Inc., a charitable foundation formed in connection with the conversion. Upon the completion of the conversion and offering, 9,507,930 shares of SR Bancorp common stock were outstanding. 
 Merger with Regal Bancorp, Inc. and Regal Bank 
 On September 19, 2023, SR Bancorp acquired Regal Bancorp, Inc. Immediately following that acquisition, Regal Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Regal Bancorp, was merged with and into Somerset Savings Bank, which was renamed Somerset Regal Bank (collectively, the Merger ). In connection with the Merger, Regal Bancorp s shareholders received 23.00 in cash for each share of Regal Bancorp common stock they owned. The aggregate cost of the Merger was approximately 69.5 million. The acquisition of Regal Bancorp and Regal Bank, expanded our market presence into Essex, Morris and Union Counties, New Jersey and enhanced our market presence in Somerset County, New Jersey. 
 1 

The Merger increased the combined banks deposit base and its loan portfolio, provided Somerset Savings Bank with greater commercial lending expertise and access to commercial loan customers and provided Regal Bank with greater residential lending expertise and access to residential loan customers. 
 Market Area 
 The Bank, which was formed in 1887, serves Essex, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union counties in New Jersey through its 14 full-service branch locations. 
 The markets served by Somerset Regal Bank encompass a broad geographic area in central and northern New Jersey. The market areas served by Somerset Regal Bank have highly developed and diverse economies. Pharmaceutical, financial services, professional services and retail companies are among the largest employers in the counties served by Somerset Regal Bank. Employment data shows that jobs in services and education/healthcare/social services accounted for the largest and second largest employment sectors, respectively, in the counties and in New Jersey. Wholesale/retail trade was the third largest employment sector for the counties followed by manufacturing jobs in the counties of Hunterdon, Morris and Somerset. Finance/insurance/real estate was the fourth largest employment sector for the counties of Essex, Middlesex and the State of New Jersey. Transportation/utility jobs were the fourth largest employment sector for Union County. 
 Population and household data indicate that the market areas served by Somerset Regal Bank s branches are a mix of urban and suburban markets. Middlesex County is the most populous county with a total population of 861,000, while Hunterdon County is the least populous county with a total population of 130,000. For the 2017 to 2022 period, Essex County recorded the strongest population growth with an annual growth rate of 0.9 . Comparatively, Middlesex County recorded the slowest population growth over the past five years, with an annual growth rate of 0.3 . Five-year annual population growth rates for the U.S. and New Jersey equaled 0.6 and 0.7 , respectively. 
 Income measures show that the counties of Hunterdon, Morris and Somerset are relatively affluent markets, with household and per capita income measures that are well above the comparable U.S. and New Jersey measures. Comparatively, household and per capita income measures for Essex County are the lowest among the primary area counties, which were also lower than the comparable New Jersey measures and similar to the comparable U.S. measures. The primary market area counties experienced income growth rates that were slightly lower than the comparable state and national growth rates for the 2017 through 2022 period. 
 A comparison of household income distribution measures provides another indication of the relative affluence of Hunterdon, Morris and Somerset Counties, which maintained significantly higher percentages of households with incomes above 100,000 compared to the U.S and New Jersey. None of the primary market area counties maintained a lower percentage of households with incomes above 100,000 compared to the U.S, while Essex County and Union County maintained a lower percentage of households with incomes above 100,000 compared to New Jersey. 
 At June 30, 2024, Somerset Regal Bank maintained its largest balance of deposits in Somerset County, where it maintains its headquarters and maintains its largest branch presence. Based on June 30, 2024 deposit data, Somerset Regal Bank s 353.1 million of deposits provided for a 2.0 market share of bank and thrift deposits in Somerset County, which was the tenth largest market share out of 20 financial institutions in the market. 
 Competition 
 We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the many financial institutions operating in our market area, including commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions, and from other financial service companies such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. Several large holding companies operate banks in our market area, and these institutions are significantly larger than us and, therefore, have significantly greater resources. We also face competition for investors funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. 
 2 

Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our market area and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from non-depository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies, financial technology companies and specialty finance companies. 
 We expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend toward consolidation of the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions, including financial technology companies, to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future. 
 Lending Activities 
 We offer a variety of loans, including residential, commercial real estate, multi-family, commercial and industrial and consumer loans. Historically, we have had a significant portion of our loan portfolio concentrated in residential loans, including one- to four-family residential loans. Our merger with Regal Bank greatly expanded our commercial loan portfolio and commercial lending capabilities. At June 30, 2024, residential mortgage loans comprised 53.7 of our total loan portfolio and commercial loans comprised 44.7 , which largely consisted of multi-family loans. 
 We did not participate in the Paycheck Protection Program administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. 
 In the future, we intend to continue to concentrate on ways to compete for a greater share of commercial loan originations in our primary market area.

One- to Four Family-Residential Mortgage Loans . We offer two types of residential mortgage loans: fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. We offer fixed-rate mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years. We offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans with interest rates and payments that adjust annually after an initial fixed period of three, five or six years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate equal to a percentage above the U.S. Treasury Security Index. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2.0 per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally 6.0 over the initial interest rate of the loan. 
 Borrower demand for adjustable-rate loans compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to the interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. 
 While one- to four-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. 
 It is our general policy not to make high loan-to-value loans (defined as loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 80 or more) without private mortgage insurance. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a board-approved independent appraiser. We require title insurance on all first mortgage loans, and borrowers 
 4 

must obtain hazard insurance. Additionally, we require flood insurance for loans on properties located in a flood zone and may require such insurance on properties not located in a flood zone. 
 Generally, adjustable-rate loans will better insulate Banks from interest rate risk as compared to fixed-rate mortgages. An increased monthly mortgage payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment, however, could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. To mitigate the risk of an increase to a monthly mortgage payment of an adjustable-rate loan, which could result in an increase to delinquencies and defaults, we adhere to strict underwriting guidelines by initially qualifying a borrower at a higher interest rate. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. 
 Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Loans . At June 30, 2024, we had 316.1 million in multi-family and commercial real estate loans, representing 43.0 of our total loan portfolio. Our commercial real estate loans are secured primarily by office buildings, industrial facilities, retail facilities and other commercial properties, substantially all of which are located in our primary market area. At June 30, 2024, commercial real estate loans totaled 135.8 million, of which 60.0 million was owner-occupied real estate and 75.8 million was secured by income producing, or non-owner-occupied real estate. 
 We generally originate commercial real estate loans with maximum maturities and amortizations of up to 30 years and loan-to-value ratios of up to 75 of the appraised value of the collateral property on purchases and up to 70 of the appraised value of the collateral property on refinances. Our commercial real estate loans are offered with adjustable interest rates, which generally adjust every three, five, seven and ten years with the interest rate indexed to the five-year United States Treasury Note rate, plus a margin, subject to an interest rate floor. All of our commercial real estate loans are subject to our underwriting procedures and guidelines, including requiring borrowers to generally establish a deposit relationship with us typically in the form of an operating account and/or tenant security accounts. At June 30, 2024, our largest commercial real estate loan totaled 6.0 million and was secured by a non-owner-occupied multi-family apartment building located in our primary market area. At June 30, 2024, this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms. 
 We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications, experience and financial condition of the borrower (including credit history), the value and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan, the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, among other factors, we consider the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure that it is at least 1.25x of the monthly debt service, and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property. Our commercial real estate loans are generally appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by the board of directors. Personal guarantees are often obtained from commercial real estate borrowers. Each borrower s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates. 
 At June 30, 2024, multi-family real estate loans totaled 180.4 million, which represented 24.5 of our total loan portfolio. Our multi-family real estate loans are generally secured by properties consisting of five or more rental units within our market area. We originate multi-family real estate loans with adjustable interest rates with maturities and amortization periods generally of up to 30 years. Interest rates on our multi-family real estate loans are generally indexed to the 5-year United States Treasury Note rate, plus a margin, subject to an interest rate floor. Adjustment periods are generally every three, five, seven and ten years. At June 30, 2024, our largest multi-family real estate loan had an outstanding balance of 6.0 million and was secured by a non-owner-occupied multi-family apartment building located in our primary market area. At June 30, 2024, this loan was performing according to its original terms. 
 5 

In underwriting multi-family real estate loans, we require a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25x and consider several factors, including the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multi-family residential real estate purchase loans have loan-to-value ratios of up to 75 of the appraised value of the property securing the loans and up to 70 of the appraised value of the collateral property on refinances. All of our multi-family real estate loans are subject to our underwriting procedures and guidelines, including requiring borrowers to generally establish a deposit relationship with us typically in the form of an operating account and/or tenant security accounts. The borrower s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. At June 30, 2024, we had 12.5 million of commercial and industrial ("C I") loans outstanding, representing 1.7 of the total loan portfolio. Typically, we originate C I loans and lines of credit to small- and medium-sized companies in our market area under the Small Business Administration ("SBA") program. Our C I loans, specifically SBA loans, are generally used for working capital purposes or for acquiring real estate, equipment, inventory or furniture. Our C I loan portfolio consists of a mix of secured loans and unsecured loans. Generally, secured loans underwritten through the SBA program can have a loan-to-value ratio of up to 90 of the real estate collateral securing the loan. When making SBA C I loans, we require a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25x and we review and consider the financial statements of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the borrower s debt service capabilities, the projected cash flows of the business, and the value of collateral, accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment. Personal guarantees are obtained from all SBA C I borrowers. We generally seek to establish the primary deposit account relationship of our C I business borrowers to maintain their principal deposit accounts with us, which improves our overall interest rate spread and profitability. We may increase this type of lending in the future. 
 The commercial loans that we offer are variable- and fixed-rate loans, generally for a one- to ten-year term. Variable interest rates are indexed to the Prime Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal , plus a margin. Commercial loans typically have shorter terms to maturity and higher interest rates than commercial real estate loans. 
 When making C I loans outside of the SBA program, we require a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25x and, for C I loans secured by real estate, a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75 of the real estate collateral securing the loan. We review and consider the financial statements of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the borrower s debt service capabilities, and the value of the collateral. We generally do not make unsecured C I loans and, if unsecured, typically we secure real estate collateral as an abundance of caution. Personal guarantees are obtained from C I borrowers. 
 At June 30, 2024, our largest C I loan totaled 1.3 million on a line of credit with a total available draw of 1.5 million, and was secured by an owner-occupied commercial building. At June 30, 2024, this loan was performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 
 Consumer loans. We generally offer home equity loans and lines of credit with a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio of 70 based on the appraised value for one- to four-family owner-occupied loans. Home equity loans have fixed rates of interest and are originated with terms of up to 20 years. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates and are based upon the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal . We hold a first or second mortgage position on all of the properties that secure our home equity loans. 
 We offer unsecured personal loans up to 5,000 and rehabilitation loans up to 10,000. Borrowers seeking a personal loan must be a Bank customer for at least one year, among other requirements. Rehabilitation loans are subject to a 70 loan to value limit and must be for one- to two-family owner-occupied properties located in the Bank s market area. We also offer loans secured by passbook and certificates of deposit accounts held at the Bank, up to 90 of the balance of the certificate of deposit or passbook. For more information on our loan commitments, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of SR Bancorp Liquidity and Capital Resources . 
 Unsecured loans generally entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans. Such loan collections depend on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, 
 6 

including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. 
 The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. 
 Loan Originations, Sales, Purchases and Participations . Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary source of loan originations are existing customers, broker referrals, walk-in traffic, purchases from correspondent banks, advertising and referrals from customers. At June 30, 2024, we had loan participations of 4.9 million. As a supplement to our in-house loan originations of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, Somerset Regal Bank enters into agreements with unaffiliated mortgage brokers as a source for additional residential real estate loans. We currently work with eight different mortgage brokers in our market area, none of which we have an ownership interest in or share any common employees or directors. These mortgage brokers fund the one- to four-family residential real estate loans and then sell them on a loan-by-loan basis to the Bank following a re-underwriting of the loan in accordance with our own underwriting criteria. We use the same parameters in evaluating these loans as we do for our in-house loan originations of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. For each purchased loan, we generally pay a fixed fee based on the loan balance. For the years ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, we purchased 41.5 million and 42.6 million, respectively, of loans from these mortgage brokers for our portfolio. As part of purchasing the loans, we acquire the servicing rights to the loans. The purchased loans are acquired from these mortgage brokers without recourse or any right to require the mortgage broker to repurchase the loans. The fixed aggregate fee we pay to acquire the loan and servicing rights are amortized over the contractual life of the loan. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management. The Board of Directors has granted loan approval authority to certain officers or groups of officers up to prescribed limits, based on the officer s position and experience. The Management Loan Committee, comprised of SR Bancorp Inc.'s Chairman, Somerset Regal Bank s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Senior Mortgage Lending Officer and Senior Commercial Lending Officer, approves residential and commercial loans up to 1.0 million and builder tract loans up to 1.5 million. Loans in excess of such amounts must be approved by the Board of Directors. The Management Loan Committee approves commercial loans up to 3.0 million. Loans in excess of such amounts must be approved by the Board of Directors. 
 Loans to One Borrower. The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower s related entities is limited, by regulation, to generally 15 of our stated capital and reserves. At June 30, 2024, our regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was 29.9 million. Our loan policy has a 15.0 million loan to one borrower limit and 20.0 million loan to related borrowers limit. At June 30, 2024, our largest lending relationship was comprised of five loans with an aggregate total of 12.9 million to related borrowers. These loans were performing in accordance with their terms at June 30, 2024. 
 Loan Commitments. We issue commitments for fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate mortgage loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers. Generally, our loan commitments expire after 60 days. 
 Non-Performing and Problem Assets 
 When a loan is 15 days past due, we send the borrower a late charge notice. If the loan delinquency is not corrected, other forms of collections are implemented, including telephone calls and collection letters. We attempt personal, direct contact with the borrower to determine the reason for the delinquency, to ensure that the borrower understands the terms of the loan and to emphasize the importance of making timely payments. If necessary, subsequent late charges and delinquency notices are issued and the account will be monitored on a regular basis thereafter. By the 90 th day of delinquency, we will send the borrower a final demand for payment, after which we 
 7 

may refer the loan to legal counsel to commence foreclosure proceedings. Any of our loan officers can shorten these time frames in consultation with the senior lending officer. 
 Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status when payment of principal or interest is 90 days or more delinquent unless the loan is considered well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans are also placed on non-accrual status if collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt. When loans are placed on a non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received. The loan may be returned to accrual status if both principal and interest payments are brought current and factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, including performance by the borrower under the loan terms for a six-month period. Our Senior Mortgage Lending Officer reports monitored loans, including all loans rated special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss, to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. In addition, management presents a quarterly credit loss allowance analysis to our Board of Directors.

Real Estate Owned . Real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair market value at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Estimated fair value generally represents the sale price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions, including normal terms from other financial institutions, less the estimated costs to sell the property. Holding costs and declines in estimated fair market value result in charges to expense after acquisition. At June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, we had no real estate owned. 
 9 

Classification of Assets. Our policies, consistent with regulatory guidelines, provide for the classification of loans and other assets that are considered to be of lesser quality as substandard, doubtful, or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those assets characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets (or portions of assets) classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and are charged to the ACL as their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve our close attention, are required to be designated as special mention. As of June 30, 2024, we had no assets designated as special mention. 
 The allowance for credit losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to absorb credit losses in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our loss allowances are subject to review by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, which can require that we establish additional loss allowances. We regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of our review of our assets at June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, we had 50,000 and 145,000, respectively of loans classified as substandard, and no assets classified as doubtful or loss. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Our allowance for credit losses ("ACL") is maintained at a level necessary to absorb credit losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for credit losses, considers the losses in our loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. A description of our methodology in establishing our allowance for credit losses is set forth in the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of SR Bancorp Critical Accounting Policies-Allowance for Credit Losses . The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2024 was maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio, and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable. However, this analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment. 
 In addition, as an integral part of their examination process, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance have authority to periodically review our allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.

Investment Activities 
 General . The goals of our investment policy are to maximize portfolio yield over the long term in a manner that is consistent with minimizing risk, and meeting liquidity needs, pledging requirements, and asset/liability management and interest rate risk strategies. Subject to loan demand and our interest rate risk analysis, we will increase the balance of our investment securities portfolio when we have excess liquidity. 
 We have authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including United States Treasury obligations, securities of various U.S. government sponsored enterprises and federal agencies, mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. Within certain regulatory limits, we also may invest a portion of our assets in corporate securities (equity as well as debt) and mutual funds. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, we also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock. 
 Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide an alternate source of low-risk investments when demand for loans is weak and to achieve a yield consistent with credit and interest rate risk parameters included in Somerset Regal Bank s policies. Our Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of our investment policy, which is reviewed and approved at least annually. The Investment Committee, consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for implementation of the investment policy, and monitoring our investment performance. Our Board of Directors reviews the status of our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis. 
 At June 30, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted solely of securities held-to-maturity, primarily of securities and obligations issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises totaling 145.7 million, subordinated debentures issued by financial institutions in the Mid-Atlantic region totaling 7.8 million and collateralized mortgage obligations totaling 2.4 million. At June 30, 2024, we also owned 1.2 million of restricted equity securities, of which 1.1 million consisted of Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, we are required to purchase stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which is carried at cost. 
 We sold all available-for-sale securities during the year ended June 30, 2024, and held no balance as of June 30, 2024. The sales were part of a balance sheet restructuring in which the Company sold 35.4 million in book value of its lower-yielding investment securities for a pre-tax realized loss of approximately 4.4 million. The Company redeployed the 30.9 million of proceeds from the sale of these securities into approximately the same amount of residential and commercial real estate mortgages. The loans originated had a positive spread differential of approximately 472 basis points over the securities that were sold, which is expected to result in 1.4 million in additional pre-tax earnings, on an annualized basis. As such, the Company estimates that the loss on the sale of securities will be recouped within approximately 3.23 years.

For additional information regarding our investment securities portfolio, see Notes 2 and 3 to the Notes to Financial Statements. 
 United States Government and Federal Agency Obligations. While United States Government and federal agency securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and as an interest rate risk hedge in the event of significant mortgage loan prepayments. 
 Mortgage-Backed Securities. We invest in mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae. 
 Mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors. Some securities pools are guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements. However, mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans since there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations. 
 Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or acceleration of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. 
 Collateral Mortgage Obligations. CMOs are debt securities issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and creates different classes of securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules, as well as a residual interest, with each class possessing different risk characteristics. The cash flows from the underlying collateral are generally divided into tranches or classes that have descending priorities with respect to the distribution of principal and interest cash flows, while cash flows on pass-through mortgage-backed securities are distributed pro rata to all security holders. All the CMOs in our investment portfolio are rated AAA by at least one of the major investment securities rating services. 
 14 

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 
 General . Deposits and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. 
 Deposit Accounts . Deposits are primarily attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW accounts), savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. At June 30, 2024, we also held 22.2 million of accounts from a variety of local municipal relationships. We have no brokered deposits. 
 We also offer a variety of deposit accounts designed for the businesses operating in our market area. Our business banking deposit products include a business checking account designed for small businesses, savings and money market accounts. We offer bill payment services through our online banking system. 
 Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, the rates on borrowings, our liquidity needs, profitability to us, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing weekly. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates on all types of deposit products, and to periodically offer special rates to attract deposits of a specific type or term. 
 The following table sets forth the distribution of total deposits by account type at the dates indicated.

Borrowings . We have the ability to utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York to supplement our investable funds. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the Federal Home Loan Bank s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness. 
 At June 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. At June 30, 2024, we had access to Federal Home Loan Bank advances of up to 100.0 million based on our unused qualifying collateral available to support such advances. 
 We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to supplement our investable funds. All borrowings are secured by pledges of qualifying loans and investment securities and are generally on overnight terms with interest rates quoted at the time of the borrowing. At June 30, 2024, we had a no outstanding borrowings with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. At June 30, 2023 we had a 20.0 million borrowing with the Federal Reserve Bank under the Bank Term Funding Program.

Subsidiaries 
 Somerset Regal Bank is SR Bancorp s only subsidiary. 
 Somerset Regal Bank maintains three subsidiaries: (1) RB Properties, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability corporation established to hold and manage foreclosed real estate properties; (2) Somerset Investment Company, a New Jersey corporation established to hold certain investment securities; and (3) Somerset Consumer Service Corporation, A New Jersey corporation that is currently inactive. 
 Regulation and Supervision 
 Upon consummation of the mutual-to-stock conversion, stock offering, charter conversion, Merger and bank merger (collectively, the transactions ), Somerset Regal Bank became a New Jersey chartered commercial bank which is not a member of the Federal Reserve System (referred to as a state nonmember bank ), subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the NJDBI and the FDIC. In turn, SR Bancorp became a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. As a public holding company, SR Bancorp is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. This description is not intended to be a complete list or description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Somerset Regal Bank and SR Bancorp. 
 
 Bank Regulation 
 As a New Jersey chartered commercial bank with federally insured deposits, Somerset Regal Bank will be subject to comprehensive regulation by the NJDBI, as its chartering authority, and by the FDIC, as its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer. New Jersey chartered commercial banks are required to file reports with, and are periodically examined by, the FDIC and the NJDBI concerning their activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. 
 This regulatory and supervisory structure is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies regarding classifying assets and establishing an adequate allowance for credit losses for regulatory purposes. The regulatory authorities have substantial discretion to take enforcement action with respect to an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or engages in violations of law or unsafe and unsound practices. 
 
 New Jersey Banking Laws and Supervision 
 As a New Jersey chartered commercial bank, Somerset Regal Bank will be subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the NJDBI, as its chartering authority. 
 Activity Powers . New Jersey chartered banks derive their lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended, and the regulations of the NJDBI. Under these laws and regulations, New Jersey chartered banks generally may invest in: 
 1. real estate mortgages; 

2. consumer and commercial loans; 

3. specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies; 

4. certain types of corporate equity securities; and 

5. certain other assets. 

17 

New Jersey-chartered banks may also make other investments pursuant to leeway authority that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act. Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of such investments. A bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the NJDBI. New Jersey-chartered banks also may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the NJDBI by regulation or by specific authorization is required. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is limited by federal law and regulations. See Federal Bank Regulation Activities and Investments below. Certain corporate transactions by a New Jersey-chartered bank, such as establishing branches and acquiring other banks, require the prior approval of the NJDBI. 
 Loan-to-One-Borrower Limitations. With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey chartered bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15 of the bank s capital funds. A bank may lend an additional 10 of the bank s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act. 
 The New Jersey Banking Act imposes conditions and limitations on the liabilities to a bank of its directors and executive officers and of corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons, that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under federal law, as discussed below. The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a bank that is in compliance with the Federal Reserve s Regulation, as discussed below, is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act. 
 Dividends. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock bank may not pay a cash dividend unless, following the payment, the bank s capital stock will be unimpaired, and the bank will have a surplus of no less than 50 of its capital stock or, if not, the payment of the dividend will not reduce the surplus of the bank. Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by a New Jersey chartered nonmember bank. See Federal Bank Regulation Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action below. 
 Minimum Capital Requirements. Regulations of the NJDBI impose on New Jersey chartered depository institutions minimum capital requirements generally similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks. See Federal Bank Regulation Capital Requirements . 
 Examination and Enforcement. The NJDBI examines all state chartered commercial banks. The NJDBI has authority to enforce applicable law and prevent practices that may cause harm to an institution, including the issuance of cease and desist orders and civil money penalties and removal of directors, officers and employees. The NJDBI also has authority to appoint a conservator or receiver for a bank under certain circumstances such as insolvency or unsafe or unsound condition to transact business. 
 
 Federal Bank Regulation 
 Supervision and Enforcement Authority . Somerset Regal Bank will be subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the FDIC as its primary federal prudential regulator and the insurer of its deposits. State nonmember banks must file reports with the FDIC concerning their activities and financial condition. State nonmember banks must also obtain prior FDIC approval before entering into certain corporate transactions such as establishing new branches and mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the FDIC to evaluate state nonmember bank's safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. 
 The FDIC maintains substantial enforcement authority over regulated institutions. That includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured bank under certain circumstances. 
 18 

Capital Requirements. FDIC regulations require FDIC-supervised institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8 , and a Tier 1 capital to average total assets leverage ratio of 4 . 
 Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI ), up to 45 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Somerset Regal Bank exercised the AOCI opt-out-election. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, a bank s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on perceived risks inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0 is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50 is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to-four family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100 is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150 is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0 to 600 is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements, effectively resulting in the following minimum ratios: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 , a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 , and a total capital ratio of 10.5 . 
 Institutions that have less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria may elect to use the optional community bank leverage ratio framework, which requires maintaining a leverage ratio of greater than 9 , to satisfy the regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. Somerset Regal Bank has opted into the community bank leverage ratio framework. 
 In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but also qualitative factors. The FDIC has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions were deemed necessary. 
 At June 30, 2024, Somerset Regal Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements. 
 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any 
 19 

standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
 
 Activities and Investments. Federal law provides that a state-chartered bank insured by the FDIC generally may not engage as a principal in any activity not permissible for a national bank to conduct or make any equity investment of a type or in an amount not authorized for a national bank, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. 
 
 In addition, the FDIC is authorized to permit a state-chartered bank to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that the activities or investments involved do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC has adopted procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. In addition, a state nonmember bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 
 
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 
 An institution is considered well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5 or greater. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 or greater. An institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5 . An institution is significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 or a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 3.0 . An institution is critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets equal to or less than 2.0 . At June 30, 2024, Somerset Regal Bank was classified as a well capitalized institution. 
 
 Undercapitalized banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized bank s compliance with a capital restoration plan must be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0 of the institution s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized bank fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with one or more of a number of possible additional measures, including an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, dismiss directors or officers, or to limit interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers or capital distributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after they are determined to be critically undercapitalized. 
 
 A bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the FDIC, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 
 
 Qualifying institutions that elect and comply with the community bank leverage ratio framework are considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations if they have a community bank leverage ratio of 9 or greater. See Capital Requirements above.

Transactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law and regulation. Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve s Regulation W, made applicable to Somerset Regal Bank by Section 18(j) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations, prohibit a bank and its subsidiaries from engaging in a covered transaction with an affiliate if the aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding with that affiliate would exceed an amount equal to 10 of the bank s capital stock and surplus. The aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding with all affiliates is limited to 20 of the bank s capital stock and surplus. The term covered transaction includes making loans to, purchasing assets from, and issuing guarantees to an affiliate, and other similar transactions. Loans or other extensions of credit by a bank to an affiliate are required to be collateralized according to the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act applies to covered transactions, as well as to certain other transactions, and requires that all such transactions be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or its subsidiary as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving a non-affiliate. Transactions covered by Section 23B also include the provision of services and selling of assets by a bank to an affiliate. 
 
 Somerset Regal Bank s loans to its and its affiliates' directors, executive officers and owners of 10 or more of its stock (each, an insider) and entities controlled by such persons (each, a related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve s Regulation, as made applicable to the Bank by Section 18(j) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extension of credit to insiders be made on terms that are substantially the same as and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that such extensions of credit do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. In addition, extensions of credit to insiders may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based on a bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by a majority of the bank s entire Board of Directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
 
 Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Deposit accounts in Somerset Regal Bank are insured up to a maximum of 250,000 per depositor. The FDIC assesses all insured depository institutions. An institution s assessment rate depends upon the perceived risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund of that institution, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Currently, assessments for institutions of less than 10 billion of total assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical models estimating the probability of failure within three years. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) for insured depository institutions with assets of less than 10 billion currently range from 24.5 to 32 basis points of each institution s total assets less tangible capital. 
 
 The FDIC may increase or decrease the range of assessments uniformly, except that no adjustment in the risk-based assessment system may be made without notice and comment rulemaking. 
 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, every insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate- income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of each state non-member bank, to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to establish branches and acquire other financial institutions. The CRA and its current regulations require the FDIC to provide a written 
 21 

evaluation of an institution s CRA performance utilizing a four- tiered descriptive rating system. Somerset Regal Bank's most recent FDIC CRA rating, dated May 31, 2022, was Satisfactory. 
 
 On October 24, 2023, the FDIC and the other federal banking agencies issued a final rule to strengthen and modernize the CRA regulations. Under the final rule, banks with assets of at least 600 million as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years and less than 2 billion as of December 31 in either of the prior two calendar years will be an intermediate bank. The agencies will evaluate intermediate banks under the Retail Lending Test and either the current community development test, referred to in the final rule as the Intermediate Bank Community Development Test, or, at the bank s option, the Community Development Financing Test. The applicability date for the majority of the provisions set out in the CRA regulations is January 1, 2026, and additional requirements will be applicable under the regulations on January 1, 2027. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. Somerset Regal Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Somerset Regal Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. Somerset Regal Bank was in compliance with this requirement at June 30, 2024. 
 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 
 Federal Holding Company Regulation . SR Bancorp is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve and subject to regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over SR Bancorp and its non-bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary bank. 
 
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5 of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (1) making or servicing loans; (2) performing certain data processing services; (3) providing discount brokerage services; (4) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (5) leasing personal or real property; (6) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (7) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. 
 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including that its depository institution subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed, to opt to become a financial holding company. A financial holding company may engage in a broader range of financial activities than a bank holding company. Such activities may include insurance underwriting and investment banking. SR Bancorp has no plans to elect financial holding company status at this time. 
 
 Capital. Bank holding companies with 3 billion or more in total consolidated assets are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements that are as stringent as those applicable to their insured depository subsidiaries. SR Bancorp has consolidated assets of less than 3 billion and, therefore, is not subject to the consolidated capital requirements, unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve. 
 
 Source of Strength. Federal law provides that bank and savings and loan holding companies must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary depository institution. The expectation is that the holding company will provide capital, liquidity and other support for the institution in times of financial stress. 
 
 22 

Stock Repurchases and Dividends. A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. Federal Reserve guidance provides for regulatory consultation and non-objection under specified circumstances prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments, including common stock, regardless of the previously referenced notification requirement. 
 
 The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions, including dividends, by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with and non-objection of the Federal Reserve in certain cases, such as where a proposed dividend exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend would be paid e.g. , calendar quarter) or where the holding company s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund a proposed dividend. The Federal Reserve guidance also provides for consultation and non-objection for material increases in the amount of a bank holding company s common stock dividend. Additionally, under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. 
 
 These regulatory policies could affect the ability of SR Bancorp to pay dividends, engage in stock repurchases or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 
 Acquisition of Holding Company. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person, or group of persons acting in concert, may acquire control of a bank holding company, such as SR Bancorp, unless the Federal Reserve has been given 60 days prior written notice and not disapproved the proposed acquisition. Control, as defined under the Change in Bank Control Act and applicable regulations, means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of the company or to vote 25 or more of any class of voting securities of the company. Acquisition of more than 10 of any class of a bank holding company s voting securities constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under certain circumstances, including where, as is the case with SR Bancorp, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. 
 
 In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Control, as defined under the Bank Holding Company Act and Federal Reserve regulations, means ownership, control or power to vote 25 or more of any class of voting stock, control in any manner over the election of a majority of the company s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or policies of the company. Any company that acquires such control becomes a bank holding company subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve. Effective September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve amended its regulations concerning when a company exercises a controlling influence over a bank or bank holding company for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act. Relevant factors include the company s voting and nonvoting equity investment in the bank or bank holding company, director, officer and employee overlap and the scope of business relationships between the company and bank or bank holding company. 
 
 New Jersey Holding Company Regulation. As a bank holding company, SR Bancorp is also subject to the provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended, and the regulations of the NJDBI. New Jersey law establishes similar filing and prior approval requirements by the NJDBI for acquisitions of New Jersey chartered institutions.

Federal Securities Laws 
 
 SR Bancorp s common stock is registered with the SEC. SR Bancorp, therefore, is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act. 
 
 The registration under the Securities Act of shares of common stock issued in the stock offering does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not affiliates of SR Bancorp may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by an affiliate of SR Bancorp will be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If SR Bancorp meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144, each affiliate that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1 of the outstanding shares of SR Bancorp, or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status. SR Bancorp qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, we also will not be subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. An emerging growth company may also elect to use an extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. 
 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. SR Bancorp has in place policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with this Act and its implementing regulations. 
 
 Federal Taxation 
 
 General. SR Bancorp and Somerset Regal Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to SR Bancorp and Somerset Regal Bank. 
 
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Somerset Regal Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending June 30 for filing its federal income tax returns. 
 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Effective with the passage of the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, net operating loss carrybacks are no longer permitted, and net operating losses are allowed to be carried forward indefinitely. Net operating loss carryforwards arising from tax years beginning after January 1, 2018 are limited to offset a maximum of 80 of a future year s taxable income. At June 30, 2024, Somerset Regal Bank had approximately 3.6 million in net operating loss carryovers at the federal level and approximately 7.2 million in net operating loss carryovers at the state level. 
 
 24 

Capital Loss Carryovers. Generally, corporations may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any loss remaining after the five-year carryover period that has not been deducted is no longer deductible. At June 30, 2024, Somerset Regal Bank had approximately 2.5 million in capital loss carryovers. 
 
 Corporate Dividends. We may generally exclude from our income 100 of dividends received from Somerset Regal Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
 
 Audit of Tax Returns. SR Bancorp's federal income tax returns and New Jersey State income tax returns have not been audited in the last three years. 
 
 State Taxation 
 
 New Jersey State Taxation. In 2014, tax legislation was enacted that changed the manner in which banks and their affiliates are taxed in New Jersey. Taxable income is apportioned to New Jersey based on the location of the taxpayer s customers, with special rules for income from certain financial transactions. The location of the taxpayer s offices and branches are not relevant to the determination of income apportioned to New Jersey. The Corporation Business Tax rate is 9 on adjusted entire net income or on the portion allocable to New Jersey; the rate is 7.5 for all corporations with entire net income of 100,000 or less; and the rate is 6.5 for all corporations with entire net income of 50,000 or less. 
 
 Maryland State Taxation . As a Maryland business corporation, SR Bancorp is required to file an annual report with and pay franchise taxes to the State of Maryland. 
 Item 1A . Risk Factors. 
 You should consider carefully the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in the shares of common stock. 
 Risks Related to Recent Acquisition 
 The Company must successfully integrate the former Regal Bank operations and retain the former Regal Bank employees and customers. 
 The Company completed its acquisition of Regal Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary Regal Bank in September 2023. Future results of operations will depend in large part on the Company s ability to successfully integrate the operations of Regal Bank and retain Regal Bank s employees and customers. If the Company is unable to successfully manage the integration of the Regal Bank cultures, employee and customer bases and operating systems and achieve the synergies and costs savings it anticipated, the Company s results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Economic Conditions 
 A worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings. 
 Local economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans. A deterioration in economic conditions, especially local conditions, could have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and could more negatively affect us compared to a financial institution that operates with more geographic diversity: 
 
 demand for our products and services may decline; 

25 

loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase; 

collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and 

the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us. 

Moreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, an epidemic or pandemic, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. 
 Inflation can have an adverse impact on our business and on our customers. 
 Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. Inflation has remained elevated and, in response the Federal Reserve Board raised certain benchmark interest rates. As discussed below under Risks Related to Interest Rates Changes in interest rates or the shape of the yield curve may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition, as inflation increases and market interest rates rise the value of our investment securities, particularly those with longer maturities, decrease, although this effect can be less pronounced for floating rate instruments. In addition, inflation generally increases the cost of goods and services we use in our business operations, such as electricity and other utilities, which increases our noninterest expenses. Furthermore, our customers are also affected by inflation and the rising costs of goods and services used in their households and businesses, which could have a negative impact on their ability to repay their loans with us. Sustained higher interest rates by the FRB to tame persistent inflationary pressures could decrease asset prices and weaken economic activity. 
 A recession could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which would lead to lower revenue, higher credit losses and lower earnings. 
 Our business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and in our local market area. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, unemployment levels, real estate values, monetary supply, consumer confidence and spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the economy in the United States generally and in our market area in particular. If the national economy experiences a recession, which might include rising unemployment levels, declines in real estate values and/or an erosion in consumer confidence, the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans in accordance with their terms could be impaired. Nearly all of our loans are secured by real estate or made to businesses in the counties in which we have offices in New Jersey. As a result of this concentration, a prolonged or more severe downturn in the local economy could result in significant increases in non-performing loans, negatively impacting our interest income and resulting in higher provisions for credit losses. An economic downturn could also result in reduced demand for credit, which would lessen our revenues. 
 Risks Related to Interest Rates 
 Changes in interest rates or the shape of the yield curve may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. 
 We derive our income mainly from the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the larger the spread, the more we earn. When market interest rates change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our income. 
 26 

In response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve s Federal Open Market Committee has significantly increased market interest rates, with the expectation of maintaining this level of market interest rates for the foreseeable future. Our net interest spread and net interest margin may have decreased and may continue to decrease due to potential increases in our cost of funds that may outpace any increases in our yield on interest-earnings assets. The rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many financial institutions, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities. For example, during the years ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, Somerset Regal Bank experienced an increase in certificates of deposits and a decrease in lower-cost savings accounts reflecting the decision of many depositors to take advantage of increased interest rates being paid on certificates of deposits. Interest rates also affect how much money we lend. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases and loan originations tend to decrease. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and securities. For example, an increase in interest rates generally results in decreased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, as borrowers are less likely to refinance their debt. 
 Risks Related to Strategy and Growth 
 Our business strategy includes moderate growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. 
 Our business strategy includes moderate growth in assets, deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market, thereby increasing our share of the market, and to expand the size of our market area. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Furthermore, there can be considerable costs involved in expanding lending capacity, and generally a period of time is required to generate the necessary revenues to offset these costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings until certain economies of scale are reached. 
 New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks. 
 From time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. In addition, we will continue to invest in research, development, and marketing for new products and services. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Furthermore, if customers do not perceive our new offerings as providing significant value, they may fail to accept our new products and services. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, the burden on management and our information technology in introducing any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A significant portion of our loans are secured by real estate, which could negatively impact our profitability upon a downturn in the local real estate market. 
 At June 30, 2024, approximately 722.4 million or 98.3 of our loan portfolio was secured by real estate, most of which is located in our primary lending market area of Essex, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union Counties, New Jersey and surrounding areas. Future declines in real estate values in our primary lending 
 27 

markets and surrounding markets because of an economic downturn could significantly impair the value of the collateral securing our loans and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure for an amount necessary to satisfy the borrower s obligations to us. This could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses to address the decrease in the value of the real estate securing our loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 
 Unlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends primarily on the general economic conditions in our primary market area. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on our residential real estate and other types of lending, including, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. 
 Our reliance on third parties to originate certain loans may negatively impact our financial results if such relationships are discontinued. 
 We purchase residential mortgage loans from third-party brokers. Such purchases represented 41.5 million, or 52.7 , of our residential mortgage loan purchases and originations for the year ended June 30, 2024. Similarly, we relied on third-party brokers to refer to us multi-family real estate loans. Such referrals represented 16.7 million, or 57.6 , of Bank's multi-family loan originations for the year ended June 30, 2024. These third parties are used to supplement the originations made by in-house staff. In each case, Somerset Regal Bank separately underwrite each loan before it is either purchased or closed. Should these broker relationships be discontinued or the Bank is otherwise unable to use these companies in the future, our ability to originate residential mortgage loans or multi-family real estate loans may be reduced unless and until we are able to find a suitable replacement or have the capability to originate such loans through our lending staff. If we have to add more staff, our compensation expense would increase. Our income may be negatively affected if our residential mortgage lending or multi-family residential lending operations are disrupted. 
 Because we intend to increase our multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial loan originations, our lending risk will increase. 
 Multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial loans generally have more risk than residential mortgage loans. Because the repayment of multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. Multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely impact the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower s business thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans. Also, many multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial business borrowers can have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan. Further, unlike residential mortgages or multi-family and commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans may be secured by collateral other than real estate, such as inventory and accounts receivable, the value of which may be more difficult to appraise, may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value at default, and may be more difficult to realize upon enforcement of our remedies. As our multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase. 
 If our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual credit losses, our earnings and capital could decrease. 
 We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate other factors including, among other things, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover probable and incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions 
 28 

to our allowance, that could materially decrease our net income. Our allowance for credit losses was 0.71 and 0.31 of total loans at June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The implementation of the Current Expected Credit Losses accounting standard or "CECL" was effective for SR Bancorp on July 1, 2023. CECL requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This changed the method of providing allowances for loan losses that are incurred or probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses in the future and will greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. 
 In addition, Somerset Regal bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and, based on their judgments and information available to them at the time of their review, may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. An increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may reduce our net income and our capital, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Funding 
 Our inability to generate core deposits may cause us to rely more heavily on wholesale funding strategies for funding and liquidity needs, which could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and profitability. 
 We must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. Deposits have traditionally been our exclusive source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also receive funds from loan repayments, maturities of securities and income on other interest-earning assets. While we emphasize generating transaction accounts, we cannot guarantee if and when this will occur. Certificates of deposit comprised 272.8 million or 33.8 of our total deposits at June 30, 2024. Certificates of deposit due within one year of June 30, 2024 totaled 111.4 million, or 13.8 of total deposits. Further, the considerable competition for deposits in our market area also has made, and may continue to make, it difficult for us to obtain reasonably priced deposits. Moreover, deposit balances can decrease if customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If we are not able to increase our lower-cost transactional deposits at a level necessary to fund our asset growth or deposit outflows, we may be forced seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, brokered deposits and lines of credit to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers, which may be more expensive and have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and profitability. 
 Risks Related to Competition 
 Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability. 
 Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition, market presence and substantially more resources that benefit them in attracting business and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Our smaller asset size also makes it more difficult to compete, as many of our competitors are larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected. Competition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. For additional information see Business of SR Bancorp and Somerset Regal Bank Competition . 
 The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of continuing legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued industry consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and 
 29 

merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many Competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services than we can as well as better pricing for those products and services. 
 Risks Related to Operations and Security 
 We face significant operational risks because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions. 
 We operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and/or suffer damage to our reputation. 
 Cyber-attacks or other security breaches could adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation. 
 We regularly collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf. 
 Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial and other transactions, the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks and mobile phishing and more employees working remotely. Mobile phishing, a means for identity thieves to obtain sensitive personal information through fraudulent e-mail, text or voice mail, is an emerging threat targeting the customers of financial entities. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses. 
 Although we employ a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to protect confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse or loss, these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, and that if mishandling, misuse or loss of information does occur, those events will be promptly detected and addressed. Similarly, when confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf, our policies and procedures require that the third party agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information, establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to preserve the confidentiality of the information, and permit us to confirm the third party s compliance with the terms of the agreement. As information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. 
 If our confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and/or financial loss. 
 30 

Risks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings. 
 Information technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur and may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security. 
 In addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. 
 The occurrence of any system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our success depends on retaining certain key personnel. 
 Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of our experienced senior management team. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as loan and deposit generation. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect our income. In addition, the loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which would reduce our net income. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. 
 The cost of additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy our new public company reporting requirements will increase our expenses. 
 The obligations of being a public company require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may need to hire additional compliance, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical knowledge, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion. As a result, we may need to rely on outside consultants to provide these services for us until qualified personnel are hired. These obligations will increase our operating expenses and could divert our management s attention from our operations. 
 We are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. 
 We are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our 
 31 

operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and operating results may be materially adversely affected. 
 Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses. 
 Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use broad and diversified risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses if we fail to properly anticipate and manage these risks. 
 While our Board of Directors takes an active role in cybersecurity risk tolerance, we rely to a large degree on management and outside consultants in overseeing cybersecurity risk management. 
 Our Board of Directors takes an active role in our cybersecurity risk management and all members receive cybersecurity training annually. The Board reviews the annual risk assessments and approves information technology policies, which include cybersecurity. Furthermore, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing all audit findings related to information technology general controls, internal and external vulnerability, and penetration testing. The Board receives an annual information security report from our Chief Technology Officer as it relates to cybersecurity and related issues. We also engage outside consultants to support our cybersecurity efforts. However, our directors do not have significant experience in cybersecurity risk management outside of the Company and therefore, its ability to fulfill its oversight function remains dependent on the input it receives from management and outside consultants. 
 Natural disasters, acts of terrorism, global market disruptions and other external events could harm our business. 
 Natural disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, violence or human error could cause disruptions to our business or the economy as a whole. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. Additionally, global markets may be adversely affected by natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Global market disruptions may affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad, as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels. 
 Risks Related to Regulatory Matters 
 Changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by our banking regulators. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of insurance funds and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for the protection of our shareholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on our operations, classify our assets and determine the level of our allowance for credit losses. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, deposit insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control 
 32 

the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. As a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the ongoing increased costs of compliance with banking and other regulations. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firm. These changes could materially impact, potentially retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions. 
 The USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. 
 Monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. 
 The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions. 
 We are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors. 
 We are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, we also will not be subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have also elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 
 33 

We are also a smaller reporting company, and even if we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors. 
 In addition to qualifying as an emerging growth company, we qualify as a smaller reporting company under the federal securities laws. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may choose to take advantage of reduced financial disclosure obligations and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile. 
 Risks Related to Accounting Matters 
 Changes in accounting standards could affect reported earnings. 
 The bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively. 
 Changes in management s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results. 
 In preparing our periodic reports, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management is required to make estimates and assumptions as of specified dates. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and experience at such times and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, and the determination of our deferred income taxes. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 Our return on equity remains low following the stock offering, which could negatively affect our stock price. 
 Net income divided by average shareholders equity, known as return on equity, is a ratio many investors use to compare the performance of financial institutions. Our return on equity will be low until we are able to profitably leverage the additional capital we received from the offering. Our return on equity also will be negatively affected by added expenses associated with our employee stock ownership plan and the stock-based benefit plan we intend to adopt. Until we can increase our net interest income and noninterest income and leverage the capital raised in the offering, we expect our return on equity to be low, which may reduce our stock price. 
 Various factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve. 
 Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of SR Bancorp without our Board of Directors approval. Under applicable regulations, for a period of three years following completion of the conversion, no person may acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10 of our common stock without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of a bank holding company. There also are provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt, including a provision that prohibits any person from voting more than 10 of our outstanding shares of common stock. Taken as a whole, these statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and thus could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Risks Related to COVID-19 
 The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to pose risks to our business, our results of operations and the future prospects of SR Bancorp. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the global and national economy and certain industries and geographies in which our clients operate. Given its ongoing and dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business of SR Bancorp, its clients, employees and third-party service providers. The extent of such an impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Additionally, the responses of various governmental and non-governmental authorities and consumers to the pandemic may negatively impact our business and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to the Somerset Regal Charitable Foundation 
 Our contribution to the charitable foundation may not be tax deductible, which could reduce our profits. 
 We may not have sufficient profits to be able to fully use the tax deduction from our contribution to the charitable foundation. Under the Internal Revenue Code, an entity is permitted to deduct up to 10 of its taxable income (generally income before federal income taxes and charitable contributions expense) in any one year for charitable contributions. Any contribution in excess of the 10 limit may be deducted for federal income tax purposes over each of the five years following the year in which the charitable contribution is made. Accordingly, a charitable contribution could, if necessary, be deducted over a six-year period and expires thereafter. 
 Item 1B . Unresolved Staff Comments. 
 Not applicable. 
 Ite m 1C. Cybersecurity. 
 Our risk management program is designed to identify, assess and mitigate risks across various aspects of our company, including financial, operational, regulatory, reputational and legal. Cybersecurity is a critical component of this program as we rely extensively on various information systems and other electronic resources to operate our business. Additionally, we rely to a great extent on third-party service providers to perform critical functions to assist in maintaining customer accounts, providing electronic banking services and financial reporting. Our Information Security Officer, who is a member of our Executive Management Team, is primarily responsible for managing our cybersecurity program. Our Information Security Officer has direct access to our Board of Directors and is authorized to evaluate our cybersecurity posture throughout the Company to ensure the implementation of appropriate controls over our systems and applications to maintain an effective cybersecurity program. The information security officer consults, where appropriate, with both our staff of IT professionals and, at times, outside security professionals to ensure the implementation of appropriate controls. 
 We have implemented a cybersecurity risk management program to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information and information technology environment. Our cybersecurity risk management program consists of an extensive range of risk assessments to identify the cyber threats to our environment along with multiple policies and procedures to mitigate the risks identified, including, but not limited to, information technology and cybersecurity standards, incident response and disaster recovery/business continuity. Employees receive regular information and cybersecurity training and reminders throughout the year. 
 Daily operations are monitored by a dedicated team of information technology professionals complemented by management s monitoring of critical information security monitoring reports along with our third-party security vendor who provides for 24x7 monitoring of our external connections and email system. Defined incident response procedures are maintained, including a requirement that our security vendor notify designated members of management when unusual or suspicious activity is identified. 
 To test and evaluate the effectiveness of our cybersecurity program, we are subject to annual audits of our program by an outside audit firm who specializes in both information technology and cybersecurity 
 35 

assessments. These assessments include a review of general IT controls, external penetration assessments, internal penetration assessments and security awareness testing of our staff. 
 Our vendor management program is designed to identify the risks associated with using third-party service providers to run our business. Third-party service providers that present cyber risk to our operations must meet specific criteria, such as the maintenance of appropriate controls, processes and monitoring to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and resources prior to being onboarded. In addition to initial assessments of our critical third-party service provides, we perform regular on-going monitoring of these critical third parties' infrastructure and performance, including data security and the effectiveness of their cybersecurity risk management programs. 
 Our Board of Directors, along with our information Technology Committee, which is comprised of key senior managers, are actively involved in providing oversight of our cybersecurity program. Monthly updates are provided to our Board regarding the status of our program, including key monitoring metrics and trends noted both internally and within our industry. Our Board reviews and approves all cybersecurity-related risk assessments, polices and formalized reviews performed throughout the year.

Item 7 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The objective of this section is to assist in the understanding of the financial performance of the Company and its subsidiaries through a discussion of our results of operations and financial condition as of the dates presented. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the SR Bancorp Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements that appear at the end of this document. Due to the timing of the stock offering and acquisition noted below, the financial information provided herein as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023 is solely that of Somerset Savings Bank, SLA, and its subsidiaries, unless indicated otherwise. 
 Conversion, Stock Offering and Merger 
 The conversion of Somerset Savings Bank, SLA from the mutual to stock form of organization and related stock offering by SR Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company"), the holding company for Somerset Savings Bank, SLA, was completed on September 19, 2023. The Company s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol SRBK on September 20, 2023. 
 The Company sold 9,055,172 shares of its common stock at a price of 10.00 per share, which included 760,634 shares sold to Somerset Regal Bank s Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Additionally, the Company contributed 452,758 shares and 906,000 in cash to the Somerset Regal Charitable Foundation, Inc., a charitable foundation formed in connection with the conversion. Upon the completion of the conversion and offering, 9,507,930 shares of Company common stock were outstanding. 
 Promptly following the completion of the conversion and related stock offering, Regal Bancorp, Inc., a New Jersey corporation Regal Bancorp ), merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity (the Merger ). Immediately following the Merger, Regal Bank, a New Jersey chartered commercial bank headquartered in Livingston, New Jersey and the wholly-owned subsidiary of Regal Bancorp, merged with and into Somerset Bank, which had converted to a commercial bank charter, and was renamed Somerset Regal Bank (the Bank ). In connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of Regal Bancorp common stock converted into the right to receive 23.00 in cash. The Merger was completed on September 19, 2023. 
 Overview 
 Our principal business is to acquire deposits from individuals and businesses in the communities surrounding our offices and to use these deposits to fund loans. 
 Somerset Regal Bank is a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank that operates from 15 branches in Essex, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union Counties, New Jersey. Somerset Regal Bank offers a variety of deposit and loan products to individuals and small businesses, most of which are located in our primary market. The acquisition of Regal Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary, Regal Bank, expanded our market presence into Essex, Morris and Union Counties, New Jersey and enhanced our market presence in Somerset County, New Jersey. At June 30, 2024, SR Bancorp had total assets of 1.02 billion, deposits of 807.1 million and total equity of 199.5 million. 
 Income . Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits. Changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income. 
 A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which is revenue that we receive from providing products and services. The majority of our noninterest income generally comes from service charges and fees related to deposit accounts and net gains in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance. In some years, we recognize income from the sale of securities. 
 40 

Allowance for Credit Losses . The allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for the current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for credit losses is charged to earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the principal loan amount is not probable. Recoveries on loans previously charged off, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses when realized. 
 Expenses. The noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses, occupancy expenses, furniture and equipment expenses, data processing, advertising, FDIC insurance premiums, directors fees, professional fees, insurance, telephone, postage and supplies and other miscellaneous expenses. 
 Our largest noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits, which consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement plans and other employee benefits including disability insurance and health insurance and compensation expenses related to the recently implemented employee stock ownership plan. 
 Occupancy expenses and furniture and equipment expenses are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, and consist primarily of depreciation charges, furniture and equipment expenses, repair and maintenance costs, real estate taxes and costs of utilities. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the expected lease terms, if shorter. 
 Data processing expenses are fees paid to third parties for use of their software and for processing customer information, deposits and loans. 
 Advertising includes most marketing expenses including multi-media advertising (public and in-branch), promotional events and materials, civic and sales focused memberships, and community support. 
 Federal deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the FDIC for insurance of our deposit accounts. 
 Professional fees include legal, accounting, auditing, risk management and payroll processing expenses. 
 Insurance includes expenses for worker s compensation, property and casualty insurance and professional insurance. 
 Other expenses include expenses for directors fees, office supplies, postage, telephone and other miscellaneous operating expenses. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Certain of our accounting policies are important to the presentation of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances that could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. 
 The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company we plan to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 
 41 

Management believes our most critical accounting policies, which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments, are as follows: the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the assessment of the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and the valuation of our deferred tax assets. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses : The allowance for credit losses ACL ), calculated in accordance with ASC 326, is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans. The ACL represents an amount that, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb the lifetime expected credit losses that may be experienced on outstanding loans at the balance sheet date based on the evaluation of the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions and prepayment experience. The allowance for credit losses is measured and recorded upon the initial recognition of a financial asset. Determination of the adequacy of the allowance is inherently complex and requires the use of significant and highly subjective estimates. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible by management. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses. 
 In calculating the allowance for credit losses, loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and risk profiles. Common characteristics and risk profiles include the type of loan, underlying collateral, geographical similarity and historical or expected credit loss patterns. The Company applies two methodologies to estimate the allowance on its pooled portfolio segments: a cohort method based on common characteristics and the weighted average remaining life method. The models related to these methodologies utilize the Company s historical default and loss experience adjusted for future economic forecasts. The reasonable and supportable forecast period represents a one-year economic outlook for the applicable economic variables. 
 In some cases, management may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics that differentiate the loan from other loans within our loan pools. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. Specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing, among other things, the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk rating of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower. 
 Management qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease management s estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be considered in making qualitative factor adjustments include, among other things: the impact of changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, write-offs, and recoveries; actual and expected changes in national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the loan pools; changes in the composition and size of the loan portfolio and in the terms of the underlying loans; changes in the experience, ability, and depth of our lending management and staff; changes in volume and severity of past due and nonaccrual assets; changes to the quality of our internal loan review system; the existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit; and regulatory, legal and environmental events. Management believes it uses relevant information available to make determinations about the allowance and that it has established the existing allowance in accordance with GAAP. However, the determination of the allowance requires significant judgment, and estimates of expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed. While management uses available information to recognize expected losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio, changes in the current and forecasted economic conditions, changes to the interest rate environment and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets : Our intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. The initial recording of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual tests for impairment, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. We may elect to perform a qualitative assessment as a part of the annual impairment test. If the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, then we would be required to perform a quantitative test for goodwill impairment. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit less than the carrying value, goodwill is impaired and is written down to its estimated fair value. 
 42 

In the year ended June 30, 2024, we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill. Based on that assessment, we determined that it was more likely than not that the unit's fair value was not less than its carrying amount. We concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of June 30, 2024. 
 Core deposit intangibles are amortized on an accelerated basis using an estimated life of ten years. The core deposit intangibles are evaluated annually for impairment in accordance with GAAP. An impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not considered recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. 
 Income Taxes : Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 
 The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. 
 A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. 
 We recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in other operating expenses. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to operate and grow a profitable community-oriented financial institution.We plan to achieve this by: 
 Leveraging our residential and commercial lending expertise to pursue new opportunities to increase lending in our primary market area and expand our existing loan relationships . Prior to the Merger, Somerset Savings Bank s principal business activity historically had been the origination of residential mortgage loans, while Regal Bank s principal business activity historically had been the origination of multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Somerset Regal Bank will continue to provide products and services that meet the needs of the existing residential lending customers and be able to offer such products, services and expertise to the former Regal Bank customers throughout its newly-expanded market area. Additionally, Somerset Regal Bank will continue to provide products and services that meet the needs of the existing commercial customers and be able to offer such products, services and expertise to the former Somerset Savings Bank customers throughout its newly-expanded market area. 
 The opportunity for both banks to diversify their loan portfolios and leverage their lending expertise in new markets were primary factors for the Merger. Moreover, with the additional capital raised in the stock offering, we can increase our loan originations in our market area and originate loans with larger balances. Somerset Regal Bank s legal lending limit was 29.9 million at June 30, 2024. While Somerset Regal Bank s credit risk management policies will result in an internal loan to one borrower limit less than Somerset Regal Bank s regulatory limit, the legal lending limit will provide opportunities to expand existing customer relationships and reach new larger customers. 
 We intend to leverage the SBA preferred lender expertise to expand SBA lending activity in our market areas. SBA lending capabilities provide an opportunity to establish additional commercial account relationships and the potential to generate additional noninterest income related to the sale and servicing of the guaranteed portion of an SBA loan on the secondary market. 
 43 

Continuing to use prudent underwriting practices to maintain a high-quality loan portfolio. Maintaining high asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. Somerset Regal Bank seeks to grow its loan portfolio while keeping non-performing assets to a minimum. Somerset Regal Bank s strategy for credit risk management focuses on having an experienced team of credit professionals, well-defined policies and procedures, appropriate and conservative loan underwriting criteria and active credit monitoring. At June 30, 2024, Somerset Regal Bank had 50,000 of non-performing loans. 
 Building profitable business and consumer relationships through enhanced product offerings and by continuing to provide superior customer service. We are a full-service financial services company offering our customers a broad range of loan and deposit products and services, including internet banking, which enables our customers to pay bills on-line. Our commercial lending capacity has been significantly enhanced through our merger, which allows us to continue to increase the commercial real estate and commercial business loans we originate and better serve the small businesses in our market area, and realize higher fees and yields associated with such type of lending. Further, commercial deposit accounts, generally yield higher average balances than can be acquired from retail deposit relationships. 
 As a community-oriented financial institution, we emphasize providing superior customer service to attract and retain customers. We deliver personalized service and respond with flexibility to customer needs. We believe that our community orientation is attractive to our customers and distinguishes us from the larger institutions that operate in our area. Further, given our attractive market area, we believe we are well-positioned to increase our customer relationships without a proportional increase in overhead expense or operating risk. 
 Increasing transaction deposit accounts and deposit balances. Deposits are our primary source of funds for lending and investment. We intend to focus on expanding our core deposits (which we define as all deposits except certificates of deposit). Core deposits represented 66.2 of our total deposits at June 30, 2024 compared to 68.4 of our total deposits at June 30, 2023. We believe core deposits will increase by increasing our commercial lending activities and enhancing our relationships with retail customers through our commitment to quality customer service along with the introduction of additional products and services, such as remote deposit capture and enhanced online business account services. 
 Continuing to leverage technology to maintain efficient operations and enhance customer service. We have historically focused on leveraging technology to maintain efficient operations and provide our customers with secure means to conduct business outside of our traditional branch network. Customer facing applications include online banking and mobile banking with bill payment capabilities, mobile deposit and debit card control functionality. We have been a Zelle participant since 2019, which has allowed our customers the ability to send and receive real-time payments online and through mobile banking. Our online loan application platform affords customers the convenience of submitting a loan application online. Internally we leverage technology to achieve efficiencies for tasks such as document preparation and retention, data analytics and call report preparation. We intend to build on this foundation and have plans to add, among other services, online deposit account opening for existing customers, tokenization (meaning the process of exchanging sensitive data with a less sensitive equivalent (or token), specifically Apply Pay , Google Pay and Samsung Pay ), and expanded business online banking capabilities including wire transfer origination and ACH origination services. These additional services are in various stages of implementation, and we anticipate customer availability for most prior to the end of 2024. Our investment in technology allows us to remain competitive, effectively serve our customers and results in operating efficiencies. 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 
 Total Assets . Total assets increased 369.4 million, or 56.7 , to 1.02 billion at June 30, 2024 from 651.5 million at June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of Regal Bancorp, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Regal Bank, on September 19, 2023, which had 427.8 million of assets at the time of the acquisition. The increase was also due to net proceeds of 86.9 million obtained from the completion of the Company s stock offering on the same date. These increases were offset by a 20.0 million repayment of a borrowing and a decrease in deposits due to the interest rate environment and competition in our market area. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents increased 3.5 million, or 8.2 , to 45.9 million at June 30, 2024 from 42.4 million at June 30, 2023 due to 55.3 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired from 
 44 

the Regal Bancorp acquisition and the net proceeds of 86.9 million retained from the stock offering, partially offset by 69.5 million paid for the acquisition of Regal Bancorp, offset by a 20.0 million repayment of a borrowing and a decrease in deposits due to the interest rate environment and competition in our market area. 
 Securities Available-for-Sale . Following the completion of the Merger, the Company sold 19.2 million of its available-for-sale portfolio, followed by the sale of the remaining 35.4 million of securities-available-for-sale in the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2024 at a loss of 4.4 million as part of its balance sheet restructuring. The Company held no securities available-for-sale at June 30, 2024. The Company redeployed the proceeds from the sale of these lower yielding securities into higher yielding loans as part of a balance sheet restructuring strategy. The loans originated had a positive spread differential of approximately 472 basis points over the securities that were sold, which is expected to result in 1.4 million in additional pre-tax earnings, on an annualized basis. As such, the Company estimates that the loss on the sale of securities will be recouped within approximately 3.23 years. 
 Securities Held-to-Maturity . Securities held-to-maturity decreased 12.9 million, or 7.5 , to 158.3 million at June 30, 2024 from 171.2 million at June 30, 2023 as the maturities of securities during the period more than offset the acquisition of 2.6 million of held-to-maturity securities from the Regal Bancorp acquisition. 
 Loans . Loans receivable, net, increased 369.6 million, or 102.0 , to 731.9 million at June 30, 2024 from 362.3 million at June 30, 2023. The Company acquired 321.6 million of loans from the Regal Bancorp acquisition, primarily consisting of multi-family and commercial real estate loans. As a result of the acquisition, the composition of the loan portfolio changed significantly from June 30, 2023. The percentage of residential mortgage loans to total loans decreased from 97.8 at June 30, 2023 to 53.7 at June 30, 2024. Commercial loans (consisting of multi-family and commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans) accounted for 44.7 of loans at June 30, 2024. 
 Bank Owned Life Insurance . Bank owned life insurance increased 8.4 million, or 29.2 , to 37.1 million at June 30, 2024 from 28.7 million at June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of the Regal Bancorp acquisition, which had 7.5 million of bank owned life insurance at the time of acquisition. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets . The Company recognized goodwill and a core deposit premium intangible through the acquisition of Regal Bancorp. At the time of acquisition, goodwill was 20.5 million and the core deposit premium intangible asset was 9.1 million. Finalization of the purchase allocation reduced goodwill to 20.4 million at June 30, 2024. No impairment loss was recognized on goodwill during the year ended June 30, 2024. The carrying amount of the core deposit premium intangible, net of accumulated amortization, was 7.7 million at June 30, 2024. 
 Total Liabilities . Total liabilities increased 292.0 million, or 55.1 , to 821.4 million at June 30, 2024 from 529.4 million at June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of the Regal Bancorp acquisition, which had 378.7 million of liabilities at the time of the acquisition, offset by a 20.0 million repayment of a borrowing and a decrease in deposits due to the interest rate environment and competition in our market area. 
 Deposits . Deposits increased 303.2 million, or 60.2 , to 807.1 million at June 30, 2024 from 503.9 million at June 30, 2023 due primarily to the 371.9 million of deposits assumed from the Regal Bank acquisition offset by a decrease in deposits due to the interest rate environment and competition in our market area. At the time of the acquisition, Regal Bank s deposits consisted of 90.8 million of noninterest-bearing deposits, 162.4 million in NOW, money market and savings accounts and 118.7 million of certificates of deposit. 
 Borrowings . We had no borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2024 as the 20.0 million of borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2023 were repaid during the year ended June 30, 2024. 
 Total Equity . Total equity increased 77.4 million, or 63.4 , to 199.5 million at June 30, 2024 from 122.1 million at June 30, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from the 86.9 million in net proceeds from the Company s stock offering and other comprehensive income of 3.8 million, partially offset by the 7.6 million initial funding of the ESOP and a net loss of 10.9 million for the period.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 
 General. The Company recorded a net loss for the year ended June 30, 2024 of 10.9 million, compared to net income of 1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to one-time merger-related expenses of 4.4 million, a 4.2 million provision for credit losses, a 5.4 million charitable contribution to establish the Somerset Regal Charitable Foundation and a 4.5 million loss on the sale of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by 4.1 million of net accretion income related to fair value adjustments. 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 24.7 million, or 153.5 , to 40.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 16.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from a 22.3 million, or 197.1 , increase in interest income on loans and a 2.8 million increase in interest income on interest bearing deposits at other banks, offset by a 482,000, or 13.1 , decrease in interest income on securities. The average balance of loans increased 282.2 million, or 80.2 , to 634.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to 352.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. In addition, the average yield on the loan portfolio increased 209 basis points to 5.30 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 3.21 for the year ended June 30, 2023, which reflected the higher interest rate environment and the greater proportion of commercial loans in the portfolio. 
 The decrease in income on securities was primarily due to the sales of 54.6 million of available-for-sale securities during the year as part of a balance sheet restructuring, which resulted in the average balance of securities decreasing 29.1 million, or 13.0 , to 195.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to 225.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. 
 The increase in the interest income on interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold was due to a 80 basis point increase in the average yield from 3.64 for the year ended June 30, 2023 to 4.44 for the year ended June 30, 2024, due to the higher interest rate environment, and a 60.4 million, or 196.1 , increase in the average balance from 30.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2023 to 91.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 due to excess cash from the merger and the offering. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 9.1 million or 373.4 , to 11.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 2.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from an increase in interest expense on certificates of deposits. The average balance of certificates of deposit increased 100.9 million, or 67.9 , to 249.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 148.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, while the average rate increased 246 basis points to 3.79 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 1.33 for the year ended June 30, 2023 as the Company increased rates on certificates of deposit to increase deposits and liquidity. The average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits increased 55.8 million, to 199.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 143.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The average rate on interest-bearing demand deposits increased 49 basis points to 0.56 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 0.07 for the year ended June 30, 2023. 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 15.7 million, or 114.5 , to 29.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 13.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The net interest rate spread increased 59 basis points to 2.73 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 2.14 for the year ended June 30, 2023 while the net interest margin increased 94 basis points to 3.19 for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 2.25 for the year ended June 30, 2023. The average balance of net interest-earning assets increased 116.34 million, or 88.8 , to 247.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 130.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increases in the net interest rate spread and net interest margin were a result of both the acquisition of Regal Bancorp and the increasing yield on interest-earning assets outpacing the increasing cost of interest-bearing liabilities primarily due to the change in the composition of the loan portfolio.

Average Balances and Yields . The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects are immaterial. Average balances are calculated using month-end average balances, rather than daily average balances. We believe the use of month-end average balances is representative of our operations. Non-accrual loans are included in average balances only. Average yields include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. Deferred loan fees are immaterial.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. Changes attributable to both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Provision for Credit Losses. We establish provisions for credit losses, which are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, we consider, among other things, loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, current and reasonably supportable economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of delinquent loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change. We assess the allowance for credit losses and make provisions for credit losses on a monthly basis. 
 Based on our evaluation of the above factors, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to having no provision for the year ended June 30, 2023. The provision recorded related to the Day 1 allowance for credit losses on Regal Bancorp's loan portfolio in the amount of 4.2 million was recorded through the provision for credit losses within the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. In 2024, we had no charge-offs and had only one classified and non-performing loan at June 30, 2024 totaling 50,000. The absence of a provision for credit losses for the year ended June 30, 2023 reflected that we had no charge-offs for the period, no classified loans at June 30, 2023 and only one non-performing loan in the amount of 145,000 at June 30, 2023. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.71 at June 30, 2024 compared to 0.31 at June 30, 2023, reflecting the establishment of a 4.2 million general credit reserve for the acquired loan portfolio. To the best of our knowledge, we have provided for all losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.

Noninterest income decreased 3.8 million, or 296.9 , to a loss of 2.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease of 4.3 million on the sale of securities due to the 4.44 million loss incurred in connection with the sale of securities as part of the Company's balance sheet restructuring. Offsetting this decrease were increases of 249,000 in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance and 151,000 in service charges and fees on deposit accounts. The increase in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance was attributable to the additional bank-owned life insurance acquired in the Merger.

Noninterest expense increased 21.4 million, or 162.9 , to 34.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 from 13.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a 5.4 million charitable contribution, contained within other expenses, as the Company established the Somerset Regal Charitable Foundation in connection with its conversion to the stock form of organization and funded it with 452,758 shares of SR Bancorp common stock and 905,517 in cash. The increase was also due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits for change in control payments totaling 2.6 million related to the Merger, an increase in professional fees for merger expenses totaling 760,000, an increase in data processing expenses primarily due to the payment of a 414,000 early termination fee related to the acquisition of Regal Bancorp, and additional miscellaneous expenses related to the Merger totaling 72,000. Furthermore, the fact the Company was operating at a significantly greater asset size for the majority of the year ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the asset size for the year ended June 30, 2023, was a contributing factor to the increase in total noninterest expense. 
 Income Tax Expense. The benefit for income taxes was 909,000 for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to a tax expense of 250,000 for the year ended June 30, 2023. The benefit for the year ended June 30, 2024 was due 
 49 

to the loss for the period and is net of a 2.2 million provision for an allowance against certain of the Company's deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate was 7.7 and 13.9 for the year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting lower state income tax liabilities due to the application of net operating loss carryforwards and a lower state income tax rate applied to the net investment income derived by Somerset Regal Bank s investment company subsidiary. 
 Market Risk 
 General . Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our ALCO/Investment Committee, which consists of members of management, is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our Board of Directors. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates. 
 We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: 
 growing transaction deposit accounts; 

rebalancing our loan portfolio through the Merger to include higher-yielding, shorter-term commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans; and 

continuing to price our one-to-four family residential real estate loan products in a way that encourages borrowers to select our adjustable-rate loans as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate loans. 

By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to changes in market interest rates. 
 
 We generally do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures or options, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities. 
 Economic Value of Equity . We compute amounts by which the net present value of our cash flow from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items (economic value of equity EVE would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. We measure potential change in our EVE through the use of a financial model. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3 to 4 would mean, for example, a 100-basis point increase in the Basis Point Change in Interest Rates column below. 
 50 

The table below sets forth, as of June 30, 2024 the calculation of the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.

The table above indicates that at June 30, 2024, after one year, we would have experienced an 7.5 decrease in NII in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and an 7.0 decrease in NII in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The above table assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the date indicated remains constant uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our NPV and will differ from actual results.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is the ability to fund assets and meet obligations as they come due. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, and repayments from investment securities. In addition, we have the ability to borrow in the wholesale markets or from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We seek to maintain a ratio of liquid assets (including cash and federal funds sold) as a percentage of total deposits ranging between 4 and 30 . At June 30, 2024, this ratio was 5.7 We believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs as of June 30, 2024. 
 We regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: 
 (i) expected loan demand; 

(ii) expected deposit flows; 

(iii) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and 

(iv) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. 

Excess cash is invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short- and intermediate-term securities. 
 Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing and investing activities during any given period. At June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 45.9 million. 
 At June 30, 2024, we had 36.0 million in outstanding loan commitments and 36.1 million of unused lines of credit. Certificates of deposit due within one year of June 30, 2024 totaled 111.4 million, or 13.8 of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including loan sales, other deposit products, including replacement certificates of deposit, securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) or advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and other borrowing sources. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or after June 30, 2024. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. 
 Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our primary investing activities are originating and purchasing loans and purchasing mortgage-backed securities. During the year ended June 30, 2024, we originated 74.1 million of loans and purchased 41.5 million. We had no purchases of securities during the year ended June 30, 2024. 
 Financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts. Deposits increased 303.2 million, or 60.2 , to 807.1 million at June 30, 2024 from 503.9 million at June 30, 2023. At the time of the acquisition, Regal Bank s deposits consisted of 90.8 million of noninterest-bearing deposits, 162.4 million in NOW, money market and savings accounts and 118.7 million of certificates of deposit. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors, and by other factors. 
 We had no outstanding borrowings with the Federal Reserve Bank at June 30, 2024 and a 20.0 million outstanding borrowing at June 30, 2023.

Regulatory Capital 
 Somerset Regal Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At June 30, 2024 Somerset Regal Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Somerset Regal Bank is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Regulation and Supervision Federal Banking Regulation Capital Requirements and Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The net proceeds from the offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources. Over time, the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of loans. Our financial condition and results of operations will be enhanced by the net proceeds from the offering, resulting in increased net interest-earning assets and net interest income. However, due to the increase in equity resulting from the net proceeds raised in the offering, our return on equity will be adversely affected following the offering until such excess funds can be deployed. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 Our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than the effects of inflation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIS TERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholders and Board of Directors of SR Bancorp Inc: 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of SR Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 /s/ Baker Tilly US, LLP 
 We have not been able to determine the specific year that we began serving as the Company s auditor; however, we are aware that we have served as the Company s auditor since at least 1994.

t record an allowance for credit losses ("ACL") on its available-for-sale ("AFS") securities during the year ended June 30, 2024 or upon implementation of CECL on July 1, 2023. As of both periods, the Company considered the unrealized losses on the AFS securities to be related to fluctuations in market conditions, primarily interest rates, and not reflective of deterioration in credit. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had AFS securities. As of June 30, 2023, the Company's AFS securities consisted primarily of highly-rated government sponsored agency (GSE) residential mortgage-backed securities. The unrealized losses were higher due to market uncertainty resulting from inflation and rising interest rates from the time of the security purchase. The Company's held-to-maturity ("HTM") portfolio consists principally of highly-rated GSE residential mortgage-backed securities. The Company segments its HTM into GSE, residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"), and other debt securities to determine the ACL. The ACL is determined based on the security's historical losses and the ratings of major investment securities rating services, adjusted for certain qualitative factors. The Company has determined that for GSE residential mortgage-backed securities, it would be appropriate to assume the expected credit loss to be zero. At both June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had HTM securities that were past due 30 days or more as to principal or interest payments. Based on its review of HTM securities, the Company deemed no ACL reserve was necessary for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

Management s determination of whether these investments are impaired is based on its assessment of the ultimate recoverability of their cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. The determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of their cost is influenced by criteria such as: (1) the significance of the decline in net assets of the FHLB as compared to the capital stock amount for the FHLB and the length of time this situation has persisted; (2) commitments by the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the FHLB; and (3) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and, accordingly, on the customer base of the FHLB. Management believes impairment charge was necessary related to the FHLB, ACBB or BCG stock as of June 30, 2024 or June 30, 2023 .

Upon completion of the Merger, the Company acquired operating leases for office space. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had not entered into any material leases that have not yet commenced.

The impact of the reserve for unfunded liabilities to the consolidated financial statements was not material. The Company did not record an allowance for held-to-maturity securities on July 1, 2023 as the investment portfolio consists almost entirely of debt securities backed by the full faith of the U.S. Government for which credit risk is deemed negligible. The impact of this ASU could change in the future depending on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the securities portfolio as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods)

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures . This standard eliminates the recognition and measurement guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan restructurings when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. For public business entities, these amendments require that an entity disclose current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. Gross charge-off information must be included in the vintage disclosures required for public business entities in accordance with paragraph 326-20-50-6, which requires that an entity disclose the amortized cost basis of financing receivables by credit quality indicator and class of financing receivable by year of origination. ASU No. 2022-02 was effective for the Company on July 1, 2023.

During the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded one-time merger-related expenses of million, consisting of million for change in control payments, for investment banking services, related to the termination of a data processing contract, for legal-related expenses, for severance payments, in other professional services and in other miscellaneous expenses. In addition, the Company recorded a million charitable contribution expense for the establishment of the Somerset Regal Charitable Foundation, as well as a million provision for estimated credit losses in connection with the acquired loan portfolio. The fair value of loans acquired from Regal Bank was estimated using cash flow projections based on the remaining maturity and repricing terms. Cash flows were adjusted by estimating future credit losses and the rate of prepayments. Projected monthly cash flows were then discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted market rate for similar loans. There was no carryover of Regal Bank s allowance for credit losses associated with the loans that were acquired. The core deposit intangible asset recognized is being amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately years utilizing the sum-of-the-years digits method. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the Company recognizes amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair value. Fair value estimates are based on the information available, and are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information relative to the closing date fair values becomes available. The fair value of retail demand and interest-bearing deposit accounts was assumed to approximate the carrying value as these accounts have no stated maturity and are payable on demand. The fair value of time deposits was estimated by discounting the contractual future cash flows using market rates offered for time deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of borrowings was based on the FHLB calculation to prepay borrowings with associated penalties.

Upon adoption of ASC 326, management no longer evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates whether there is a credit loss associated with any declines in fair value. Management considers the nature of the collateral, default rates, delinquency rates, credit ratings and interest rate changes, among other factors. However, the Company has determined that highly-rated issues of mortgage-backed securities of government-sponsored agencies have a zero expected credit loss.

The Company engages primarily in the lending of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans. Lending activities are targeted to individuals within the Company's geographic footprint. Risks associated with lending activities include economic conditions and changes in interest rates, which can adversely impact both the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the associated collateral. Credit risk exposure in these areas of lending are minimized by the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-income ratios, credit scores and conservative underwriting standards that emphasize conservative loan-to-value ratios of generally no more than for commercial loans, for multifamily loans and for residential loans. Residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the loan-to-value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance. The real estate home equity portfolio consists of fixed-rate home equity loans and variable-rate home equity lines of credit. Risks associated with second lien loans secured by residential properties are generally lower than commercial loans and include general economic risks, such as the strength of the job market, employment stability and the strength of the housing market.

Net deferred income tax asset included in other assets 

A deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. The measurement of such deferred tax items is reduced by the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on available evidence. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards become deductible. At June 30, 2024 and 2023, there was a valuation allowance of million and , respectively. A corporation may carry forward net operating losses to the succeeding taxable years for New Jersey state tax purposes. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank had total state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that expire beginning in tax year . Management assesses the available evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the existing deferred tax asset. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, a valuation allowance of million was established for the year ended June 30, 2024 attributable to the Company's charitable contribution and capital loss carryforwards. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income increased or if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. Net deferred tax assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. At June 30, 2023 , the Company had valuation allowance.

 million, comprised of million for unused equity lines of credit and million to originate and purchase loans, expiring within . At June 30, 2023, total unfunded loan-related commitments, including lines of credit, amounted to million , comprised of million for unused equity lines of credit and million to originate and purchase loans, expiring within . Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. A reserve for unfunded commitments is recognized and included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Periodic adjustments to either increase or decrease the reserve are recognized in non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income, however the Company recorded no expense for the years ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. The balance for unfunded commitments was at both June 30, 2024 and 2023. 

 , comprised of common equity Tier I capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements and must be maintained to avoid limitations on capital distributions. In 2021, the Bank adopted the new community bank leverage ratio framework. This framework simplifies the regulatory capital requirements by requiring the Bank to meet only the Tier 1 capital to average assets (leverage) ratio. The Bank must only maintain a leverage ratio greater than the required minimum to be considered well capitalized under this framework. The Bank can opt out of the new framework and return to the risk-weighting framework at any time.

The classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Other securities are measured at fair value using quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets and are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. The estimated fair values of equity securities are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized exchanges (Level 1 inputs).

Appraisal of collateral 
 
 Selling costs 

Loans which meet certain criteria are evaluated individually for impairment. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Bank's impaired loans are generally collateral dependent whose fair value is estimated through current appraisals, and adjusted as necessary by management to reflect current market conditions. Appraisals of collateral securing impaired loans are conducted by approved, qualified, and independent third-party appraisers. Such appraisals are ordered once the loan is deemed impaired, as previously described. Impaired loans are generally classified as Level 3 assets. There were transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company discloses fair value information about financial assets, whether or not recognized in the statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The fair value of financial assets that are not measured at fair value in the financial statements were based on the exit price notion. The following estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, the estimates below are not necessarily indicative of amounts that could be realized in the marketplace. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Exhibit 4.1 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF SR BANCORP CAPITAL STOCK 
 General 
 SR Bancorp, Inc. SR Bancorp is authorized to issue 55,000,000 shares, of which 50,000,000 shares are common stock having a par value of 0.01 per share and 5,000,000 shares are preferred stock having a par value of 0.01 per share. Each share of SR Bancorp s common stock has the same relative rights as, and is identical in all respects with, each other share of common stock. All of the shares of common stock are duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable. 
 Common Stock 
 Dividends. SR Bancorp may pay dividends on its common stock if, after giving effect to such distribution, (1) it would be able to pay its indebtedness as the indebtedness comes due in the usual course of business and (2) its total assets exceed the sum of its liabilities and the amount needed, if it were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of any holders of capital stock who have a preference upon dissolution. The holders of common stock of SR Bancorp will be entitled to receive and share equally in dividends declared by the Board of Directors of SR Bancorp. If SR Bancorp issues preferred stock, the holders of the preferred stock may have a priority over the holders of the common stock with respect to dividends. 
 Voting Rights. The holders of common stock of SR Bancorp will possess exclusive voting rights in SR Bancorp. They elect SR Bancorp s Board of Directors and act on other matters as are required to be presented to them under Maryland law or as are otherwise presented to them by the Board of Directors. Generally, each holder of common stock will be entitled to one vote per share and will not have any right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. Any person who beneficially owns more than 10 of then-outstanding shares of SR Bancorp s common stock, however, is not entitled or permitted to vote any shares of common stock held in excess of the 10 limit. If SR Bancorp issues preferred stock, holders of SR Bancorp preferred stock may also possess voting rights. 
 Liquidation. If there is any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Somerset Regal Bank, SR Bancorp, as the sole holder of Somerset Regal Bank s capital stock, would be entitled to receive all of Somerset Regal Bank s assets available for distribution after payment or provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of Somerset Regal Bank, including all deposit accounts and accrued interest and the balance of the liquidation account, if any. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of SR Bancorp, the holders of its common stock would be entitled to receive after payment or provision for payment of all its debts and liabilities all of the assets of SR Bancorp available for distribution. If SR Bancorp issues preferred stock, the preferred stockholders may have a priority over the holders of the common stock upon liquidation or dissolution. 

Preemptive Rights; Redemption. Holders of the common stock of SR Bancorp are not be entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares that may be issued. The common stock cannot be redeemed. 
 Dissenters Rights of Appraisal. SR Bancorp s articles of incorporation provide that SR Bancorp s shareholders will not be entitled to dissenters rights of appraisal with respect to a merger or consolidation of SR Bancorp with another corporation unless the Board of Directors determines by a resolution approved by a majority of directors then in office that dissenters rights will apply to all or any classes of stock. 
 Preferred Stock 
 Preferred stock may be issued with designations, powers, preferences and rights as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. The Board of Directors can, without shareholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, liquidation and conversion rights that could dilute the voting strength of the holders of the common stock and may assist management in impeding an unfriendly takeover or attempted change in control. 
 SR Bancorp s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 SR Bancorp s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain a number of provisions relating to corporate governance and rights of shareholders that might discourage future takeover attempts. As a result, shareholders who might desire to participate in such transactions may not have an opportunity to do so. In addition, these provisions will also render the removal of the Board of Directors or management of SR Bancorp more difficult. 
 Directors . SR Bancorp s Board of Directors is currently divided into three classes, with the members of each class of directors serving staggered three-year terms. SR Bancorp s bylaws provide for the phased-in elimination of the classified board of directors over a seven-year period, such that by the SR Bancorp 2030 annual meeting of stockholders, all directors are elected to serve a one-year term. 
 Evaluation of Offers. The articles of incorporation of SR Bancorp provide that its Board of Directors, when evaluating a transaction that would or may involve a change in control of SR Bancorp (whether by purchases of its securities, merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution, liquidation, sale of all or substantially all of its assets, proxy solicitation or otherwise), may, in connection with the exercise of its business judgment in determining what is in the best interests of SR Bancorp and its shareholders and in making any recommendation to the shareholders, give due consideration to all relevant factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the social and economic effect on the present and future employees, creditors and customers of, and others dealing with, SR Bancorp and its subsidiaries and on the communities in which SR Bancorp and its subsidiaries operate or are located; 

whether the proposal is acceptable based on the historical, current or projected future operating results or financial condition of SR Bancorp; 

whether a more favorable price could be obtained for SR Bancorp s stock or other securities in the future; 

the reputation and business practices of the other entity to be involved in the transaction, including its management and affiliates, and how they would affect the employees of SR Bancorp and its subsidiaries; 

any anti-trust or other legal and regulatory issues that are raised by the proposal; 

the business and historical, current or expected future financial condition or operating results of the other entity to be involved in the transaction, including, but not limited to, debt service and other existing financial obligations, financial obligations to be incurred in connection with the proposed transaction, and other likely financial obligations of the other entity to be involved in the proposed transaction; and 

the ability of SR Bancorp to fulfill its objectives as a financial institution holding company and the ability of its subsidiary financial institution(s) to fulfill the objectives of a federally insured financial institution under applicable statutes and regulations. 

If the Board of Directors determines that any proposed transaction should be rejected, it may take any lawful action to defeat such transaction. 
 Restrictions on Calling Special Meetings . SR Bancorp s bylaws provide that special meetings of shareholders may be called by the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairperson of the Board or by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors that SR Bancorp would have if there were no vacancies on the Board of Directors. In addition, special meetings of the shareholders shall be called by the Secretary at the request of shareholders only on the written request of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting. 
 Prohibition of Cumulative Voting . The articles of incorporation prohibit cumulative voting for the election of directors. 
 Limitation on Voting Rights . The articles of incorporation provide that in no event will any person who owns more than 10 of then-outstanding shares of common stock, be entitled or permitted to vote any of the shares of common stock held in excess of the 10 limit. The 10 limit does not apply if, before the shareholder acquires shares in excess of the 10 limit, the acquisition is approved by a majority of the directors who are not affiliated with the holder and who were members of the Board of Directors before the time of the acquisition (or who were chosen to fill any vacancy of an otherwise unaffiliated director by a majority of the unaffiliated directors). 
 Restrictions on Removing Directors from Office . SR Bancorp s articles of incorporation provide that directors may be removed from office only for cause and only by the vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, (after giving effect to the limitation on voting rights discussed above in Limitation on Voting Rights ). 

Shareholder Nominations and Proposals. The bylaws provide that any shareholder desiring to make a nomination for the election of directors or a proposal for new business at an annual meeting of shareholders must submit written notice to SR Bancorp between 90 and 120 days before the anniversary date of the proxy statement relating to the previous year s annual meeting. However, if less than 90 days prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given to shareholders and the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days, or delayed by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of the preceding year s annual meeting, then shareholders must submit written notice to SR Bancorp no later than 10 days following the day on which public disclosure of the date of the meeting is first made. Shareholder submissions regarding nominations or business proposals must contain certain information as set forth in the bylaws. 
 Authorized but Unissued Shares . The articles of incorporation authorize 50,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of serial preferred stock. SR Bancorp is authorized to issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series subject to applicable provisions of law, and the Board of Directors is authorized to fix the designations, and relative preferences, limitations as to dividends, voting rights, and terms and conditions of redemption of such shares. In addition, the articles of incorporation provide that a majority of the total number of directors may, without action by the shareholders, amend the articles of incorporation to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock of any class or series that SR Bancorp has the authority to issue. If there is a proposed merger, tender offer or other attempt to gain control of SR Bancorp that the Board of Directors does not approve, it would be possible for the Board of Directors to authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock with rights and preferences that would impede the completion of the transaction. An effect of the possible issuance of preferred stock therefore may be to deter a future attempt to gain control of SR Bancorp. 
 Filling Vacancies on the Board of Directors. Pursuant to SR Bancorp s articles of incorporation, vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, and any director elected to fill a vacancy will hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies. 
 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. Generally, SR Bancorp s articles may be amended by the approval of at least two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast by the holders of shares of capital stock of SR Bancorp entitled to vote on the matter, except that the proposed amendment of any provision of the articles of incorporation need only be approved by the vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of shares of capital stock of SR Bancorp entitled to vote on the matter if the amendment of such provision is approved by at least two-thirds of the Board of Directors. However, SR Bancorp s articles of incorporation provide that following the SR Bancorp 2030 annual meeting of stockholders, SR Bancorp stockholders will be able to amend the SR Bancorp articles by a majority vote regardless of whether such amendment was approved by two-thirds of the Board of Directors. 
 SR Bancorp s bylaws may be amended either by a majority of the Board of Directors, or by an 80 vote of SR Bancorp s shareholders, voting together as a single class. However, SR Bancorp s articles of incorporation provide that following the SR Bancorp 2030 annual meeting of stockholders, SR Bancorp stockholders will be able to amend the SR Bancorp bylaws by a majority vote. 

Maryland Corporate Law 
 Business Combinations. Under Maryland law, business combinations between a Maryland corporation and an interested shareholder or an affiliate of an interested shareholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, certain transfers of assets, certain stock issuances and transfers, liquidation plans and reclassifications involving interested shareholders and their affiliates or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. Maryland law defines an interested shareholder as: (1) any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of a corporation s voting stock after the date on which the corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of its stock; or (2) an affiliate or associate of the corporation at any time after the date on which the corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of its stock who, within the two-year period before the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock of the corporation. A person is not an interested shareholder under the statute if the Board of Directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder. However, in approving a transaction, the Board of Directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board. 
 After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested shareholder generally must be recommended by the Board of Directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least: (1) 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation; and (2) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation excluding shares held by the interested shareholder with whom the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder. These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation s common shareholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its shares. 
 Maryland Control Share Acquisition Statute. Maryland General Corporation Law contains a control share acquisition statute that, in general terms, provides that where a shareholder acquires issued and outstanding shares of a corporation s voting stock (referred to as control shares) within one of several specified ranges (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more), approval by shareholders of the control share acquisition must be obtained before the acquiring shareholder may vote the control shares. The required shareholder vote is two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast, excluding interested shares, defined as shares held by the acquiring person, officers of the corporation and employees who are also directors of the corporation. 
 A corporation may, however, opt out of the control share statute through an articles or bylaw provision, which SR Bancorp has done pursuant to its bylaws. Accordingly, the Maryland control share acquisition statute does not apply to acquisitions of shares of SR Bancorp common stock. Though not expected, SR Bancorp could decide to become subject to the Maryland control share acquisition statute by amending its bylaws to eliminate the opt-out provision. 

Conversion Regulations 
 Conversion regulations provide that, except with the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve, no person may make an offer or announcement of an offer to purchase shares or actually acquire shares of a converted institution or its holding company for a period of three years from the date of the completion of the conversion if, upon the completion of such offer, announcement or acquisition, the person would become the beneficial owner of more than 10.0 of the outstanding stock of the institution or its holding company. 
 Change in Control Regulations 
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person, or group of persons acting in concert, may acquire control of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not disapproved the proposed acquisition. The Federal Reserve considers several factors in evaluating a notice, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and competitive effects. Control, as defined under the applicable regulations, means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of the company or to vote 25 or more of any class of voting securities of the company. Acquisition of more than 10 of any class of a bank holding company s voting securities constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under certain circumstances, including where, as will be the case with SR Bancorp, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control (as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act) of a bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Any company that acquires such control becomes a bank holding company subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve.

Exhibit 10.6 
 
 SR BANCORP, INC. 
 
 POLICY REGARDING INSIDER TRADING 

SR Bancorp, Inc. (the Company is a public company, the common stock of which is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a public company, the Company files periodic reports and proxy statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Investment by directors, officers and employees in the Company stock is generally desirable and encouraged. However, such investments should be made with caution and with recognition of the legal prohibitions against the use of confidential information by insiders for their own profit. 
 As a director, officer or employee of a public company, you have the responsibility not to participate in the market for the Company stock while in possession of material, non-public (inside) information about the Company. There are harsh civil and criminal penalties if you wrongly obtain or use such material, inside information when you are deciding whether to buy or sell securities, or if you give that information to another person who uses it in buying or selling securities. If you buy or sell securities while in possession of material, inside information, you will not only have to pay back any profit you made, but you could be found guilty of criminal charges, and face substantial fines or even prison. Additionally, the Company could be held liable for your violations of insider trading laws. 
 To avoid these harsh consequences, the Company has developed the following guidelines to briefly explain the insider trading laws and set forth procedures and limitations on trading by directors, officers and employees. However, these guidelines do not address all possible situations that you may face. In addition, you need to review and understand the Company s Policy on Fair Disclosure to Investors that describes your obligations regarding the selective disclosure of confidential information to ensure compliance with SEC Regulation FD, which requires fair disclosure of material, non-public information. 
 Insider Trading Concepts 
 What is Inside Information? 
 Inside information includes any non-public information of which you become aware because of your special relationship with the Company as a director, officer or employee and which has not been disclosed to the public i.e. , is non-public). The information may be about the Company, Somerset Regal Bank (the Bank or any other subsidiaries or affiliates. It may also include information you learn about another company (for example, companies that are current or prospective customers or suppliers to the Company or those with which the Company may be in negotiations regarding a potential transaction). 

What is Material Information? 
 Information is material if an investor would think that it is important in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold stock, or if it could affect the market price of the stock. Either good or bad information may be material. If you are unsure whether the information is material, assume it is material. 
 Examples of material information typically include, but are not limited to: 
 Financial or accounting problems; 

Estimates of future earnings or losses; 

Significant non-recurring gains or losses; 

Events that could result in restating financial information; 

A proposed acquisition, sale or merger; 

Changes in key management personnel; 

Beginning or settling a major lawsuit; 

Changes in dividend policies; 

Declaring a stock split; 

A stock repurchase program; or 

A stock or bond offering. 

What is Non-Public Information? 
 Non-public information is information that has not yet been made public by the Company. Information only becomes public when the Company makes an official announcement (in a publicly accessible conference call, a press release or in SEC filings, for example) and the investing public has had an opportunity to see or hear it. 
 Trading Guidelines 
 A.	Rules Applicable to All Directors, Officers and Employees. 
 No director, officer or employee may trade any security , whether issued by the Company or by any other company, while in possession of material inside information about the issuer. Further, no director, officer or employee may disclose material inside information to any other person (including immediate family members, friends or stockbrokers) so that such other person may trade in the stock. It is usually safe to buy or sell stock after the information is officially announced, as long as you do not know of other material information that has not yet been announced. Even after the information is announced, you should generally wait one full trading day before buying or selling securities to allow the market to absorb the information. 
 This means the following with respect to certain Bank or Company employee benefit plans: 
 401(k) Plan . An officer or employee having material inside information regarding the Company may not (i) initiate a transfer of funds into or out of an SR Bancorp, Inc. stock fund of the 401(k) plan, or (ii) increase an existing election to invest funds in 

the SR Bancorp, Inc. stock fund. However, ongoing purchases of the Company s stock through the plan pursuant to a prior election are not prohibited. 

Other Company Stock Purchase Plans . A director, officer or employee having material inside information regarding the Company may not sign up for, or increase participation in, any employee stock purchase plan or dividend reinvestment plan. However, ongoing purchases through those plans pursuant to a prior election are not prohibited. 

Stock Options . A director, officer or employee may exercise a stock option at any time, but any stock acquired upon such exercise may not be sold (whether by means of a cashless exercise or otherwise) if the employee has material inside information regarding the Company. At any time, however, an employee may deliver Company stock already owned to pay the option exercise price and taxes. 

B.	Additional Rules. 
 1.	 Options and Other Stock Plans . The sale of stock acquired upon an exercise of stock options and the transfer of funds into and out of the Company s stock plans are subject to special rules. The Filing Coordinator should be contacted before any such transaction is conducted. 
 2.	 Pension Fund Blackouts . The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the Company to prohibit all purchases, sales or transfers of the Company s securities by directors and executive officers during a pension fund blackout period. A pension fund blackout period exists whenever 50 or more of the plan participants are unable to conduct transactions in their accounts for more than three consecutive days. These blackout periods typically occur when there is a change in the retirement plan s trustee, record keeper or investment manager. Directors and executive officers will be contacted when these or other restricted trading periods are instituted. 
 3.	 Rule 10b5-1 Plans . Directors and executive officers may only enter into a trading plan when they are not in possession of material non-public information. In addition, directors and executive officers should not enter into a trading plan during a quarterly blackout period or during a pension blackout period. The Filing Coordinator should be contacted prior to implementation of a trading plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Transactions made under a trading plan should be promptly reported to the Filing Coordinator who will prepare the necessary Form 4. Certain information regarding the trading plan will be required to be disclosed in the Company s SEC filings, including a description of the material terms of such trading plan. 

C.	Additional Rules Applicable to Proposed Mergers/Acquisitions. 
 Whenever the Company is actively considering a merger, acquisition or another significant business relationship (such as a joint venture), all Company personnel aware of the transaction or involved in due diligence or other planning for or attention to the transaction or business relationship should not trade in any of the Company s securities and any securities of the other company without first contacting the Filing Coordinator, who may consult with outside counsel. 
 Note : 	This policy applies to securities transactions by the directors and officers and by the employees aware of the transaction or involved in due diligence or other planning for or attention to the transaction or business relationship and also applies to: 
 (a) Transactions for accounts in which the director, officer or employee has an interest or an ability to influence transactions; and 

(b) Transactions by the director s, officer s or employee s spouse or any other member of their household unless (i) the household member s investment decisions are made independently of the director, officer or employee and (ii) the household member has not received inside information about the issuer of the security. 

D. Stock Repurchase by the Company. 

This policy does not restrict the Company s purchase of its common stock. The Board of Directors may choose to delegate to the Chief Executive Officer or his designee(s) the authority and discretion to authorize the Company to purchase Company common stock pursuant to a Board-approved and currently effective stock repurchase program, including during a restricted trading period under this policy. In such a circumstance, the Chief Executive Officer must determine that the following conditions are met: 
 (a) The Company is not in possession of material non-public information that prohibits such purchases; 

(b) Market conditions for the repurchase are favorable; 

(c) There are no material differences in the financial condition of the Company referenced in the last publicly reported balance sheet date that have not been publicly disclosed;

Confidentiality 
 Serious problems could develop for the Company by unauthorized disclosure of inside information about the Company, whether or not to facilitate improper trading of the Company s stock. 
 A. Confidentiality of Non-Public Information. 

Directors, officers and employees should not discuss internal matters or developments with anyone outside of the Company (including family members, securities analysts, individual investors, members of the investment community and news media), except as required in the performance of regular corporate duties. In addition, directors, officers and employees of the Company with knowledge of material, non-public information should only disclose such information to other Company personnel on a need-to-know basis so that the group of individuals with knowledge of material, non-public information is kept as small as possible. 
 All inquiries about the Company made by the financial press, investment analysts or others in the financial community, or by stockholders must be handled in accordance with the Company s Policy on Fair Disclosure to Investors. If you have any doubt as to your responsibilities under this policy, you should seek clarification from the Disclosure Policy Compliance Officer before acting. 
 B. Prohibition Against Internet Disclosure 

It is inappropriate for any unauthorized person to disclose Company information or to discuss the Company on the Internet, including in any forum or chat room where companies and their prospects are discussed. The posts in these forums are, in some cases, made by investors who are poorly informed, who have malicious intent or who intend to benefit their own stock positions. To avoid the disclosure of material, inside information, no director, officer or employee may discuss the Company or Company-related information in an Internet forum or chat room, regardless of the situation.
