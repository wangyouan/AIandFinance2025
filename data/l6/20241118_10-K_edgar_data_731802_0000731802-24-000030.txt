 PART I 
 The terms we, our, us, Atmos Energy, and the Company refer to Atmos Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context suggests otherwise. 

ITEM 1. Business. 
 Overview and Strategy 
 Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and incorporated in Texas and Virginia, is the country s largest natural-gas-only distributor based on number of customers. We safely deliver reliable, efficient, and abundant natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over 3.3 million residential, commercial, public authority, and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the South. We also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in Texas based on miles of pipe. 
 Atmos Energy's vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services. We will be recognized for exceptional customer service, for being a great employer, and for achieving superior financial results. 
 Our operating strategy is focused on modernizing our business and infrastructure while reducing regulatory lag. This operating strategy supports continued investment in safety, innovation, environmental sustainability, and our communities. 
 Operating Segments 
 We manage and review our consolidated operations through the following reportable segments: 
 The distribution segment is comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states. 
 The pipeline and storage segment is comprised primarily of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana. 
 Distribution Segment Overview 
 The following table summarizes key information about our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions, presented in order of total rate base. 
 Division Service Areas Communities Served Customer Meters Mid-Tex Texas, including the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex 550 1,804,265 Kentucky/Mid-States Kentucky 220 176,903 Tennessee 161,193 Virginia 23,777 Louisiana Louisiana 270 360,870 West Texas Amarillo, Lubbock, Midland 80 314,503 Mississippi Mississippi 110 251,147 Colorado-Kansas Colorado 170 129,727 Kansas 139,435 
 We operate in our service areas under terms of non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve. At September 30, 2024, we held 1,026 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years. A number of our franchises expire each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their terms. Historically, we have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises as they expire. 
 Revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. These rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business, including a reasonable return on invested capital. In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our distribution systems.

Table of Contents 

 Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that (i) are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs, (ii) represent a large component of our cost of service, and (iii) are generally outside our control. 
 Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a traditional and common form of cost adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas. Therefore, although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, distribution operating income is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas. 
 Additionally, some jurisdictions have performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking adjustments, purchased gas costs savings are shared between the Company and its customers. 
 Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers, including independent producers, and marketers. The gas is delivered into our systems by various pipeline companies, withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets, and base load and peaking arrangements, as needed. 
 Supply arrangements consist of both base load and peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices. Base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and peaking quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions. 
 Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers. We select these suppliers based on their ability to reliably deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost. Major suppliers during fiscal 2024 were Cima Energy, LP, ConocoPhillips Company, EnLink Gas Marketing LP, Enterprise Navitas Midstream Midland Basin LLC, Hartree Partners, L.P., Sequent Energy Management LLC, Symmetry Energy Solutions, LLC, Targa Gas Marketing LLC, Tenaska Marking Ventures, and Texla Energy Management, Inc. 
 The combination of base load and peaking agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage, allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which minimizes our need to enter into long-term firm commitments. We estimate our peak-day availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 5.3 Bcf. The peak-day demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2024 was on January 15, 2024, when sales to customers reached approximately 4.3 Bcf. 
 Currently, our distribution divisions utilize 34 pipeline transportation companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have pipeline no-notice storage service, which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas supply for our Mid-Tex Division is delivered primarily by our APT Division. 
 To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have the ability, and have exercised our right, to interrupt or curtail service to certain customers pursuant to contracts and applicable state regulations or statutes. Our customers demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis, and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities. Interruption and curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs requirements of our customers on a reliable basis. Priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as other factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the demands of some of our customers. 
 Pipeline and Storage Segment Overview 
 Our pipeline and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of APT and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana. APT is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas-producing areas of central, northern, and eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the Barnett Shale, the Texas Gulf Coast, and the Permian Basin of West Texas. Through its system, APT provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third party local distribution companies, industrial and electric generation customers, marketers, and producers. As part of its pipeline operations, APT owns and operates five underground storage facilities in Texas. 
 Revenues earned from transportation and storage services for APT are subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the RRC. Rates are updated through periodic filings made under Texas GRIP. GRIP allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five

 years; the most recent of which was completed in December 2023. APT s existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under market-based rates. 
 Our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana are comprised of a 21-mile pipeline located in the New Orleans, Louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in Louisiana under a long-term contract and, on a more limited basis, to third parties. The demand fee charged to our Louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. We also manage two asset management plans that serve distribution affiliates of the Company, which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. Generally, these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements. 
 Ratemaking Activity 
 Overview 
 The method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate. The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment. Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business, including a reasonable return on invested capital. 
 Our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag, obtaining adequate returns, and providing stable, predictable margins, which benefit both our customers and the Company. As a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years, Atmos Energy has: 
 Formula rate mechanisms in place in four states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to rates. 
 Infrastructure programs in place in all of our states that provide for an annual adjustment to rates for qualifying capital expenditures. Through our annual formula rate mechanisms and infrastructure programs, we have the ability to begin recovering approximately 90 percent of our capital expenditures within six months and substantially all of our capital expenditures within twelve months. 
 Authorization in tariffs, statute or commission rules that allows us to defer certain elements of our cost of service such as depreciation, ad valorem taxes, pension costs, and certain safety related expenses, until they are included in rates. 
 WNA mechanisms in seven states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on approximately 97 percent of our distribution residential and commercial revenues. 
 The ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts in six states which represents approximately 89 percent of our distribution residential and commercial revenues.

 Although substantial progress has been made in recent years to improve rate design and recovery of investment across our service areas, we are continuing to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments. Further, potential changes in federal energy policy, federal safety regulations, and changing economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the Company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors. 
 Recent Ratemaking Activity 
 The amounts described in the following sections represent the annual operating income that was requested or received in each rate filing, which may not necessarily reflect the stated amount referenced in the final order, as certain operating costs may have changed as a result of the commission's or other governmental authority's final ruling. Our ratemaking outcomes include the refund (return) of excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation and do not reflect the true economic benefit of the outcomes because they do not include the corresponding income tax benefit. The following tables summarize the annualized ratemaking outcomes we implemented in each of the last three fiscal years.

 Annual Formula Rate Mechanisms 
 As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual basis without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms. We currently have specific infrastructure programs in all of our distribution divisions with tariffs in place to permit the investment associated with these programs to have their surcharge rate adjusted annually to recover approved capital costs incurred in a prior test-year period. The following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms by state.

 Rate Case Filings 
 A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates. This process is referred to as a show cause action. Adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the Company s costs as well as a reasonable rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable, reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers. 
 The following table summarizes our recent rate case activity during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

 Other Regulation 
 We are regulated by various state or local public utility authorities. We are also subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities. In addition, our operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters. From time to time, we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters. We believe that our properties and operations comply with, and are operated in conformity with, applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations. 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 There are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), within the U.S. Department of Transportation, develops and enforces regulations for the safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operation of the pipeline transportation system. The PHMSA pipeline safety statutes provide for states to assume safety authority over intrastate natural transmission and distribution gas pipelines. State pipeline safety programs are responsible for adopting and enforcing the federal and state pipeline safety regulations for intrastate natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines. 
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA), gas transportation services through our APT assets on behalf of interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines, without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGPA. Additionally, the FERC has regulatory authority over the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. The FERC also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with FERC s other rules, policies, and orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation, or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. We have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations. 
 The SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act, established numerous regulations relating to U.S. financial markets. We enacted procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regulations. 
 Competition 
 Although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas, we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers. We compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources, including, in particular, electricity. Electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water heating, and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved equipment efficiencies, and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential, commercial, and industrial markets. 
 Our pipeline and storage operations have historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage, and other services for customers. In the last few years, several new pipelines have been completed, which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business. 
 Employees 
 The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability, and Safety Committee of the Board of Directors oversees matters relating to equal employment opportunities, diversity, and inclusion; human workplace rights; employee health and safety; and the Company s vision, values, and culture. It oversees the Company's policies, practices, and procedures relating to sustainability to support the alignment of the Company's sustainability strategy with the Company's corporate strategy. 
 Part of our vision is to create a culture that respects and appreciates diversity. For this reason, we strive to have a workforce that reflects the communities we serve. At September 30, 2024, we had 5,260 employees. We monitor our workforce data on a calendar year basis. As of December 31, 2023, the last date for which information is available, 61 percent of our employees worked in field roles and 39 percent worked in support/shared services roles. None of our employees have chosen to work under a collective bargaining agreement. 

To recruit and hire individuals with a variety of skills, talents, backgrounds, and experiences, we value and cultivate our strong relationships with various community and diversity outreach sources. We also target jobs fairs including those focused on minority, veteran, and women candidates and partner with local colleges and universities to identify and recruit qualified

 applicants in each of the cities and towns we serve. Finally, we believe we offer a competitive benefits program to help retain our employees. 

We perform succession planning annually to ensure that we develop and sustain a strong bench of talent capable of performing at the highest levels. Not only is talent identified, but potential paths of development are discussed to ensure that employees have an opportunity to build their skills and are well-prepared for future roles. The strength of our succession planning process is evident through our long history of promoting most of our leaders from within the organization.

 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors, many of which are not within our control. Investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report. These factors include the following, which are organized by category: 
 Regulatory and Legislative Risks 
 We are subject to federal, state, and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results. 
 We are subject to safety and financial regulatory oversight from various federal, state, and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve. Therefore, our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other third-party intervenors. In the normal course of business, as a regulated entity, we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust 
 14 

Table of Contents 

 our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed. Further, the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking. Because of this process, we could suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly referred to as regulatory lag. 
 Regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved various infrastructure and annual rate adjustment mechanisms to effectively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process. Regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms. The regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may (i) review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or (ii) limit or disallow the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers. 
 We are also subject to laws, regulations, and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state, and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the clean-up of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to employee health and safety. Environmental legislation also requires that our facilities, sites, and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned, and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits, and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties, or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results. In addition, existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations. 
 Some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results. 
 FERC has regulatory authority over some of our operations, including the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. FERC has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with FERC s other rules, policies, and orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation, or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. These rules carry increased penalties for violations. Although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current FERC regulations, changes in FERC regulations or their interpretation by FERC or additional regulations issued by FERC in the future could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or financial results. 
 We may experience increased federal, state, and local regulation of the safety of our operations. 
 The safety and protection of the public, our customers, and our employees is our top priority. We constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution systems to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely, reliably, and efficiently through our network of more than 80,000 miles of distribution and transmission lines. As in recent years, natural gas distribution and pipeline companies are continuing to encounter increasing federal, state, and local oversight of the safety of their operations. Although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates, the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a short-term adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results. 
 Operational Risks 
 We may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs. 
 PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in high consequence areas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. As a pipeline operator, the Company is required to: 
 perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; 
 identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area 
 improve data collection, integration, and analysis; 
 repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and 
 implement preventative and mitigating actions. 
 The Company incurs significant costs to comply with existing PHMSA and comparable state regulations. Although we believe these costs are ultimately recoverable through our rates, the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a short-term adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results. For example, the adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require installation of new or modified safety controls, new capital projects, or accelerated maintenance programs, all of which could require a potentially significant increase in operating costs.

 Distributing, transporting, and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs. 
 Our operations involve a number of hazards and operating risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of our distribution system. While Atmos Energy, with the support from each of its regulatory commissions, is accelerating the replacement of pipeline infrastructure, operating issues such as leaks, accidents, equipment problems, and incidents, including explosions and fire, could result in legal liability, repair, and remediation costs, increased operating costs, significant increased capital expenditures, regulatory fines and penalties, and other costs and a loss of customer confidence. We maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks. However, because some of our transmission pipeline and storage facilities are near or are in populated areas, any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large. If these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance, which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles, our operations or financial results could be adversely affected. 
 If contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline, and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner, our ability to meet our customers natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 In order to meet our customers annual and seasonal natural gas demands, we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas, interstate pipeline capacity, and storage capacity. If we are unable to obtain these, either from our suppliers inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions, legislative or regulatory actions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, extreme cold weather, terrorist or cyber-attacks, or acts of war, our operations or financial results could be adversely affected. 
 Our operations are subject to increased competition. 
 In residential and commercial customer markets, our distribution operations compete with other energy products, such as electricity and propane. Our primary product competition is with electricity for heating, water heating, and cooking. If customer growth slows or existing customers choose to conserve their use of gas or choose another energy product, reduced gas purchases and customer billings could adversely impact our business. 
 In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic conditions, including higher gas costs, could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy, such as electricity, or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per-unit costs. Our pipeline and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage, and other services for customers. The completion of new pipelines in our service area may increase the competition in this segment of our business. 
 Failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 The competition for talent has become increasingly intense and we may experience increased employee turnover due to a tightening labor market. If we are unable to recruit and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, the Company could encounter operating challenges primarily due to a loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, errors due to inexperience, or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel. In addition, higher costs could result from loss of productivity, increased safety compliance issues, or cost of contract labor. 
 Additionally, our ability to operate is contingent on maintaining a healthy workforce and a safe working environment. As a provider of essential services, we have an obligation to provide natural gas services to customers. Incidents that impact the health and availability of our workforce could threaten the continuity of our business operations. 
 Natural disasters, adverse weather, terrorist activities, or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results. 
 Natural disasters and adverse weather are always a threat to our assets and operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Also, companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations to increased risks. As a result, the Company's contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited, which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results. 
 Technology and Cybersecurity Risks 
 The failure of technology may hinder the Company s business operations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 The Company uses Company-owned information technology and technology hosted by third parties to support critical functions including scheduling and dispatching of service technicians, automated meter reading systems, customer care and billing, operational plant logistics, management reporting, and external financial reporting. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or the Company s inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder its business operations and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations. 
 Although the Company has, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into its computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that these efforts would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies. 
 Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information. 
 Our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems. Disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers, operate our pipeline and storage systems, or serve our customers timely. Further, any attack on our technology systems that would result in the unauthorized release of confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs, and expose us to material legal claims and liability. The Company has implemented policies, procedures, and controls to identify, protect, detect, and respond to cyberattacks or acts of terrorism. However, these measures may be insufficient or become ineffective, and there are no assurances that cybersecurity breaches or acts of terrorism will not impact our business operations and strategy, results of operations, and financial condition in the future. Even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyber-related risks, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage. 
 Compliance with and changes in cybersecurity requirements have a cost and operational impact on our business, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 
 As cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated, U.S. government warnings have indicated that critical infrastructure assets, including pipeline infrastructure, may be specifically targeted by certain groups. In recent years, the U.S. government has issued directives that require critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, provide vulnerability assessments, and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements. Such directives or other requirements may require expenditure of significant additional resources to respond to cyber-attacks, to continue to modify or enhance protective measures, or to assess, investigate, and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities. Any failure to comply with such government regulations or failure in our cybersecurity protective measures may result in enforcement actions that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, there is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against threats will be recovered through rates. 
 Climate Risks 
 Adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results. 
 We have weather-normalized rates for approximately 97 percent of our residential and commercial revenues in our distribution operations, which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmer-than-normal weather for meters in those service areas. However, there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future. The loss of such weather-normalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, our operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season. Additionally, sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our operations. 
 Legislation to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions or fossil fuels could increase our operating costs, adversely affecting our financial results, growth, cash flows, and results of operations. 
 Six of the eight states in which we operate have passed legislation to prevent local governments from limiting the types of energy available to customers. However, federal, regional, and/or state legislative and/or regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane, by requiring the adoption of new infrastructure or technology to limit greenhouse gas emissions, limiting our ability to serve new or existing customers, imposing costs or restrictions on end users of natural gas, or assessing additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities. Such laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows if the costs we incur to comply with these laws or regulations are not recovered or if the cost of providing natural gas services becomes prohibitively expensive, leading to a reduction in the demand for natural gas or fuel-switching to alternate sources of energy.

 The operations and financial results of the Company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate change. 
 Climate change may result in a reduction in the demand for natural gas or cause shifts in the population of our service territories which could adversely impact the economic outlook for our service territories. These occurrences could adversely impact our financial results, growth, cash flows, and results of operations. 
 It could also result in more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers or impact the cost of gas. If we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers, our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent we would be unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services, our future business, financial condition, or financial results could be adversely impacted. 
 Financial, Economic, and Market Risks 
 Our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business, which requires extensive capital spending. 
 Our operations are capital-intensive. We must make significant capital expenditures on a long-term basis to modernize our distribution and transmission system and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate. In addition, we must continually build new capacity to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve. The magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors, including new policy and regulations, and the general state of the economy. 
 The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing. The cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets, interest rates and other market conditions. This in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure. 
 The Company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy. 
 Our long-term debt is currently rated as investment grade by Standard Poor s Corporation and Moody s Investors Service, Inc. Similar to most companies, we rely upon access to both short-term and long-term credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements. If adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private credit and public capital markets, we could see a reduction in our liquidity. A significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the credit rating agencies. Such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit and/or public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing. 
 While we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future. The future effects on our business, liquidity, and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us, both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate. 
 We are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control, which could adversely affect our financial results. 
 We are subject to market risks beyond our control, including (i) commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics, counterparty performance, or counterparty creditworthiness and (ii) interest rate risk. We are generally insulated from commodity price risk through our purchased gas cost mechanisms. With respect to interest rate risk, increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results to the extent that we do not recover our actual interest expense in our rates. 
 The concentration of our operations in the State of Texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions, weather patterns, and regulatory decisions in Texas. 
 Approximately 75 percent of our consolidated operations are located in the State of Texas. This concentration of our business in Texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the Texas economy in general, weather patterns, and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in Texas. 
 A deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results. 
 Any adverse changes in economic conditions in the states in which we operate could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households. As a result, our customers could seek to use less gas and it may be more difficult for them to pay their gas bills. This would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable. This, in turn, could increase our financing requirements. Additionally, should economic conditions deteriorate, our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources, which could result in lower transportation volumes.

 Increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness. 
 Rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in short-term or long-term debt. We must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered. Increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collections as customers may delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to higher than normal accounts receivable. This could result in higher short-term debt levels, greater collection efforts, and increased bad debt expense. 
 Our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to investment and interest rate risk that could negatively impact our financial condition. 
 We have pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide benefits to many of our employees and retirees. Costs of providing benefits and related- funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plans. The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in the Company s financial statements are affected by various factors, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, including economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies, and demographics. Poor investment returns or lower interest rates may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements, which could have an adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations if such costs are not ultimately recoverable.

 ITEM 1C. Cybersecurity. 
 We continuously assess our risk of cyber threats to adapt quickly to the ever-changing challenges and risks surrounding cybersecurity. Atmos Energy has implemented policies, procedures, and controls to identify, protect, detect, and respond to cyberattacks or acts of online terrorism. Atmos Energy is also subject to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Transportation Security Administration (TSA) security directive for our natural gas pipeline monitoring and control systems. 
 The potential impact of cybersecurity risks on our business operations, results of operations, or financial condition is discussed in the Technology and Cybersecurity Risks section of Item 1A Risk Factors. We have not had any material cybersecurity breaches or incidents and have not incurred any material expenses, penalties, or settlement costs related to any cybersecurity breaches or incidents. However, measures that we take to identify, protect, detect, and respond from cybersecurity breaches or incidents may be insufficient or become ineffective, and there are no assurances that cybersecurity breaches or incidents will not impact our business operations and strategy, results of operations, and financial condition in the future. 
 The following describes our risk management and strategy and corporate governance as it pertains to cybersecurity. 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 Atmos Energy s cybersecurity program leverages the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) in its design of controls intended to reduce the risk and potential impact of cybersecurity incidents. This comprehensive approach encompasses continuous monitoring, risk assessments, a cybersecurity incident response plan, and regular evaluations to align our practices with industry standards. Additionally, we actively engage in cybersecurity risk management practices and continually improve procedures and practices to support the continued safe and reliable delivery of natural gas to our customers. 
 The identification and management of cybersecurity risk is a component of our Integrated Risk Management process, which applies adaptive process improvement to help us respond to the changing cybersecurity landscape. Additionally, we use third parties to enhance our collective capability to monitor, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. Further, we maintain collaborative relationships with government officials, law enforcement, and industry peers to keep informed of trends and potential cyber tactics. Finally, we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for the size and complexity of our business. 
 We have an information technology cybersecurity incident response plan to manage cybersecurity incidents. The plan provides guidelines for actions in response to cyber security incidents that may occur at or otherwise affect Atmos Energy. These guidelines include notification to a cross-functional management team to assess incident materiality and an escalation process to members of our senior management team and our Board of Directors. This plan, which is periodically reviewed and tested, is supported by third parties to provide guidance and support to our cybersecurity management team.

Table of Contents 

 We also address cybersecurity risks associated with third-party service providers, including those in our supply chain or who have access to our data or our information technology systems. Atmos Energy currently conducts cyber assessments on potential vendors that will have access to information technology systems, data or facilities that house such systems or data. Following approval, those vendors are contractually required to manage their cybersecurity risks and provide notification in the event of a cybersecurity incident. 
 Governance 
 Our Vice President and Chief Information Officer (CIO), who has over two decades of experience in information technology, is responsible for overseeing our cybersecurity program. The CIO oversees an IT Information security team responsible for our overall cybersecurity program. This team is comprised of several IT professionals with varying degrees of cybersecurity experience and is led by our Director Cybersecurity who has over 30 years of experience in information technology and cybersecurity. The Director Cybersecurity reports to the CIO, who reports to the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
 The CIO is a member of the Company s Risk Management and Compliance Committee (RMCC). The RMCC is comprised of members from the senior leadership team and is responsible for overseeing enterprise-wide risk management across all categories, including cybersecurity. The RMCC is overseen by the Company s Management Committee, which is comprised of the President and Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Utility Operations, Senior Vice President, General Counsel Corporate Secretary and Senior Vice President, Human Resources. The CIO provides regular cybersecurity updates to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Management Committee. These updates address prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents, as well as risks, threats, and the threat landscape. 
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the company's cybersecurity risks. Additionally, our Board of Directors periodically engages with third-party advisors to provide further education about cybersecurity risks.

 ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

INTRODUCTION 
 This section provides management s discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. It includes management s interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results, and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
 Several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above, Risk Factors . They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements. 
 Cautionary Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 
 The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of our documents or oral presentations, the words anticipate , believe , estimate , expect , forecast , goal , intend , objective , plan , projection , seek , strategy , or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply, and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the following: federal, state, and local regulatory and political trends and decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; possible increased federal, state, and local regulation of the safety of our operations; possible significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs; the inherent hazards and risks involved in distributing, transporting, and storing natural gas; the availability and accessibility of contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline, and/or storage services; increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce; natural disasters, adverse weather, terrorist activities, or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control; failure of technology that affects the Company's business operations; the threat of cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee, or Company

 information; the impact of new cybersecurity compliance requirements; adverse weather conditions; the impact of legislation to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions or fossil fuels; the impact of climate change; the capital-intensive nature of our business; our ability to continue to access the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities, including commodity price volatility, counterparty performance or creditworthiness, and interest rate risk; the concentration of our operations in Texas; the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers; changes in the availability and price of natural gas; and increased costs of providing health care benefits, along with pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates. 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult, subjective, or complex accounting estimates. Accordingly, these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policy Summary of Policy Factors Influencing Application of the Policy Regulation Our distribution and pipeline operations meet the criteria of a cost-based, rate-regulated entity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, the financial results for these operations reflect the effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions to which we are subject. As a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized. The amounts expected to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations. Discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities or changes in the accounting for our various regulatory mechanisms could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income.

 Critical Accounting Policy Summary of Policy Factors Influencing Application of the Policy Pension and other postretirement plans Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a September 30 measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates, and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. The assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate, and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those rates from the prior year, and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing, and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years. The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use of this methodology will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period. We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date. General economic and market conditions

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Overview 
 Atmos Energy's vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services. Our commitment to this vision requires significant levels of capital spending to modernize our natural gas distribution system and operating costs to deliver natural gas safely and reliably and in full compliance with the various safety regulations impacting our business. We have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of our expenditures timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns. The execution of our capital spending program, the ability to recover these expenditures timely and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance. 
 The following table details our consolidated net income by segment during the last three fiscal years: 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2024 2023 2022 (In thousands) Distribution segment 671,413 580,397 521,977 Pipeline and storage segment 371,482 305,465 252,421 Net income 1,042,895 885,862 774,398 
 During fiscal 2024, we recorded net income of 1,042.9 million, or 6.83 per diluted share, compared to net income of 885.9 million, or 6.10 per diluted share in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in net income of 157.0 million largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending. Additionally, our fiscal 2024 results were favorably impacted by 21.1 million as a result of legislation that became effective during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to reduce property tax expenses in Texas and 13.9 million as a result of a change to our bad debt recovery mechanism in Mississippi. These increases were partially offset by increased employee-related costs, depreciation expense, and interest expense. 
 During the year ended September 30, 2024, we implemented ratemaking regulatory actions which resulted in an increase in annual operating income of 376.3 million. Excluding the impact of the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation, our total fiscal 2024 rate outcomes were 307.1 million. Additionally, we had ratemaking efforts in progress at September 30, 2024, seeking a total increase in annual operating income of 218.0 million. 
 During fiscal year 2024, we refunded 133.6 million in excess deferred tax liabilities to customers. These refunds also reduced our income tax expense, resulting in an immaterial impact to our fiscal 2024 and 2023 results. 
 Capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 were 2.9 billion. Approximately 83 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation systems, with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less. 
 During fiscal 2024, we completed approximately 2.0 billion of long-term debt and equity financing. As of September 30, 2024, our equity capitalization was 61.0 percent. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 4.8 billion in total liquidity, consisting of 307.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, 1,380.6 million in funds available through equity forward sales agreements, and 3,094.4 million in undrawn capacity under our credit facilities. 
 Distribution Segment 
 The distribution segment is comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states. The primary factors that impact the results of our distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, competitive factors in the energy industry, and economic conditions in our service areas. 
 Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and, ultimately, separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. The Ratemaking Activity section of this Form 10-K describes our current rate strategy, progress towards implementing that strategy, and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail. During fiscal 2024, we completed regulatory proceedings in our distribution segment resulting in a 266.8 million increase in annual operating income. Excluding the impact of the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation, our total fiscal 2024 annualized rate outcomes in our distribution segment were 234.5 million. 
 Our distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas. We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; therefore, increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Revenues in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. 
 The cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our operating income because these costs are recovered through our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. However, higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense. This risk is currently mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 89 percent of our residential and commercial revenues. Additionally, higher gas costs may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities, resulting in higher interest expense. Finally, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources.

 Fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating income for our distribution segment increased 23.4 percent. Key drivers for the change in operating income include: 
 a 219.2 million increase in rate adjustments, primarily in our Mid-Tex Division. 
 a 24.8 million increase related to residential customer growth, primarily in our Mid-Tex Division, and increased industrial load. 
 a 10.6 million decrease in bad debt expense, as discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Partially offset by: 
 a 50.0 million increase in depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments. 
 a 19.9 million increase in employee-related costs primarily due to an increase in headcount to support company growth. 
 a 2.7 million increase in property taxes, which is inclusive of a 15.7 million decrease related to the Texas property tax legislation discussed above. 
 a 26.9 million increase in other operation and maintenance expense, including higher costs associated with software maintenance, compliance activities, training, and other administrative costs. 
 Interest charges increased 39.9 million primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt during fiscal 2024. The increase in interest charges is also due to the amortization of the Texas regulatory asset that is discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. However, this increase is offset by a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in no impact to net income. 
 The fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 for our distribution segment is described in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. 
 The following table shows our operating income by distribution division, in order of total rate base, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

 Pipeline and Storage Segment 
 Our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline Texas Division (APT) and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana. APT is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central, northern, and eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the Barnett Shale, the Texas Gulf Coast, and the Permian Basin of West Texas. APT provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third-party local distribution companies, industrial, and electric generation customers, as well as marketers and producers. Over 80 percent of this segment's revenues are derived from these APT services. These revenues are subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC). As part of its pipeline operations, APT owns and operates five underground storage facilities in Texas. 
 Our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana are comprised of a 21-mile pipeline located in the New Orleans, Louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in Louisiana under a long-term contract and, on a more limited basis, to third parties. The demand fee charged to our Louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. We also manage two asset management plans, which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. Generally, these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements. 
 Our pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry, and economic conditions in our Texas and Louisiana service areas. Natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas. However, natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the supply areas that we serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipelines. Further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve in Texas could influence the volumes of gas transported for shippers through our Texas pipeline system and rates for such transportation. 
 The results of APT are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of its local distribution company customers. Additionally, its operations may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs. 
 APT annually uses GRIP to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year. On February 27, 2024, APT made a GRIP filing that covered changes in net property, plant and equipment investment from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023 with a requested increase in operating income of 82.4 million. On May 14, 2024, the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) approved the Company's GRIP filing. 
 Additionally, GRIP requires a utility to file a statement of intent at least once every five years to review its costs and expenses, including capital costs filed for recovery under GRIP. On May 19, 2023, APT filed its statement of intent seeking 107.4 million in additional annual operating income. On December 13, 2023, the RRC approved the settlement agreement between APT and the intervening parties for an increase in annual operating income of 27.0 million, exclusive of the impact of the cessation of 36.9 million in excess deferred income tax refunds, which are substantially offset by a corresponding increase in income taxes. New rates were implemented effective December 13, 2023. 
 The demand fee our Louisiana natural gas transmission pipeline charges to our Louisiana distribution division increases five percent annually and has been approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission until September 30, 2027.

 Fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating income for our pipeline and storage segment increased 33.8 percent. Key drivers for the change in operating income include: 
 a 68.4 million increase due to rate adjustments from the GRIP filings approved in May 2023 and 2024, and the rate case approved in December 2023. 
 a 39.0 million net increase in APT's through-system activities primarily associated with increased spreads. 
 a 27.8 million decrease in refunds of excess deferred taxes to customers, which is substantially offset in income tax expense. 
 a 14.5 million increase due to higher capacity contracted by tariff-based customers due to their increased peak day demand. 
 a 3.1 million decrease in property taxes, which is inclusive of a 5.4 million decrease related to the Texas property tax legislation discussed above. 
 Partially offset by: 
 an 8.4 million increase in depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments. 
 an 18.1 million increase in operation and maintenance expense due to increased storage and compression maintenance and other compliance-related activities. 
 Interest charges increased 13.5 million primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt during fiscal 2024. 
 The fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 for our pipeline and storage segment is described in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing. Additionally, we have a 1.5 billion commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with 3.1 billion in total availability from third-party lenders. The commercial paper program and credit facilities provide cost-effective, short-term financing until it can be replaced with a balance of long-term debt and equity financing that achieves the Company's desired capital structure. Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis. 
 We have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows us to issue up to 5.0 billion in common stock and/or debt securities. As of the date of this report, 1.1 billion of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement, which expires March 31, 2026. 
 We also have an at-the-market (ATM) equity sales program that allows us to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 1.0 billion (including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to forward sale agreements entered into in connection with the ATM equity sales program), which expires March 31, 2026. As of the date of this report, 10.0 million of equity is available for issuance under this ATM equity sales program. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had 1.4 billion in available proceeds from outstanding forward sale agreements issued under the ATM program. 
 In the first half of fiscal 2025, we anticipate filing a new 8.0 billion shelf registration statement and a prospectus supplement under this new shelf registration statement for a new 1.7 billion ATM equity sales program to replace the former arrangements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had the following forward starting interest rate swaps in place to hedge future planned debt issuances: 
 Planned Debt Issuance Date Amount Hedged Effective Interest Rate (In thousands) Fiscal 2026 300,000 2.16 300,000 
 The liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the Company's working capital needs and capital expenditures program. Additionally, we expect to continue to be able to obtain financing upon reasonable terms as necessary. 
 The following table presents our capitalization as of September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 September 30 2024 2023 (In thousands, except percentages) Short-term debt 241,933 1.4 Long-term debt (1)

 (1) Inclusive of our finance leases, but exclusive of AEK's securitized long-term debt. 

Cash Flows 
 Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These factors include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks, and other factors. 
 Cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 are presented below.

 Cash flows from operating activities 
 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, cash flow provided by operating activities was 1,733.7 million compared with 3,459.7 million in the prior year. Fiscal 2023 operating cash flow included 2,021.9 million of cash received as a result of the conclusion of Texas securitization proceedings. Excluding this cash inflow, operating cash flow in fiscal 2023 was 1,437.8 million, and the year-over-year increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects the positive effects of successful rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2024 and 2023. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Our capital expenditures are primarily used to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission system through pipeline replacement and system modernization and to enhance and expand our system to meet customer needs. Over the last three fiscal years, approximately 86 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system. 
 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we had 2.9 billion in capital expenditures compared with 2.8 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Capital spending in our distribution segment increased 322.2 million, primarily as a result of increased system modernization and customer growth spending. Capital spending in our pipeline and storage segment decreased 191.0 million, primarily due to the timing of spending for pipeline system safety and reliability in Texas. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Our financing activities provided 1,478.6 million of cash for fiscal year 2024 compared with 696.8 million of cash used by financing activities for fiscal year 2023. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we received approximately 2.0 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity. We completed a public offering of 500 million of 6.20 senior notes due October 2053 and 400 million of 5.90 senior notes due October 2033, and received net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, of 889.4 million. We also completed a public offering of 325 million of 5.90 senior notes due October 2033, and received net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, of 339.0 million. Additionally, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we settled 6,401,469 shares that had been sold on a forward basis for net proceeds of 750.0 million. The net proceeds were used primarily to support capital spending and for other general corporate purposes. We also received 231.1 million from the settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps related to a debt issuance completed in October 2024. Cash dividends increased due to an 8.8 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we repaid 2.2 billion in long-term debt, and we received approximately 1.6 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity. We completed a public offering of 500 million of 5.75 senior notes due October 2052 and 300 million of 5.45 senior notes due October 2032, and received net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, of 789.4 million. Additionally, during the year ended September 30, 2023, we settled 7,272,261 shares that had been sold on a forward basis for net proceeds of 806.9 million. The net proceeds were used primarily to support capital spending and for other general corporate purposes. We also received 171.1 million from the settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps related to a debt issuance completed in October 2023. Cash dividends increased due to an 8.8 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares

 (1) Share amounts do not include shares issued under forward sale agreements until the shares have been settled. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including but not limited to, debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest, and operating cash flow less dividends to debt. In addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the risks associated with our business, and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate. 
 Our debt is rated by two rating agencies: Standard Poor s Corporation (S P) and Moody s Investors Service (Moody s). On April 1, 2024, Moody's reaffirmed its long-term and short-term credit ratings and placed our ratings under negative outlook. As of September 30, 2024, our outlook and current debt ratings, which are all considered investment grade, are as follows: 
 S P Moody s Senior unsecured long-term debt A- A1 Short-term debt A-2 P-1 Outlook Stable Negative 
 A significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings. 
 A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating is AAA for S P and Aaa for Moody s. The lowest investment grade credit rating is BBB- for S P and Baa3 for Moody s. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. Our debt covenants are described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

 We maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts. Our Mid-Tex Division also maintains a limited number of long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices. At September 30, 2024, we were committed to purchase 25.9 Bcf within one year and 38.7 Bcf within two to three years under indexed contracts. At September 30, 2024, we were committed to purchase 6.8 Bcf within one year under fixed price contracts with a weighted average price of 3.10 per Mcf. 
 
 Risk Management Activities 
 In our distribution and pipeline and storage segments, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts, and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. Additionally, we manage interest rate risk by entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. 
 We record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices.

Commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. Interest-rate risk is the potential increased cost we could incur when we issue debt instruments or to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities. Additionally, interest-rate risk could affect our ability to issue cost effective equity instruments. 
 We conduct risk management activities in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments. In our distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed-price forward contracts, and financial instruments, primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season. Our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, our earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short-term commercial paper and our other short-term borrowings. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We purchase natural gas for our distribution operations. Substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Therefore, our distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates associated with our short-term commercial paper program and other short-term borrowings. We use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short-term interest rate risk. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our short-term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short-term borrowings. Had interest rates associated with our short-term borrowings increased by an average of one percent, our interest expense would not have materially increased during 2024.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy Corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Company) as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 18, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

 Regulation 
 Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s distribution and pipeline and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which they operate. The Company s accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions and are subject to accounting principles for rate-regulated activities. As a result, certain costs are permitted to be capitalized rather than expensed because they can be recovered through rates. The Company records certain costs as regulatory assets when future recovery through customer rates is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon the Company s historical experience and understanding of the regulations. As of September 30, 2024, there were 579.4 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets and 1,227.9 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting cash outflow or potential refund. 
 Auditing the effects of regulatory matters is complex as it requires specialized knowledge of rate-regulated activities and assessments as to matters that could affect the recording or updating of regulatory assets and liabilities. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities, including, among others, controls over management's assessment of the likelihood of approval by regulators for new matters and controls over the evaluation on rulings with regulatory bodies on existing regulatory assets and liabilities, including factors that may affect the timing or nature of recoverability. 
 We performed audit procedures that included, among others, examining evidence of correspondence with regulatory bodies to test that the Company appropriately evaluated information obtained from regulatory rulings. For example, we assessed the recoverability and completeness of various regulatory assets and liabilities, considering information obtained from regulatory rulings. In addition, we tested that amortization of regulatory assets and liabilities corresponded to relevant regulatory rulings. 

/s/ 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 1983.

APT provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third party local distribution companies, and certain industrial customers under tariff rates approved by the RRC. APT also provides certain transportation and storage services to industrial and electric generation customers, as well as marketers and producers, under negotiated rates. Our pipeline in Louisiana is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our Louisiana Division under a long-term contract and on a more limited basis to third parties. The demand fee charged to our Louisiana Division is subject to regulatory approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. We also manage asset management plans with distribution affiliates of the Company at terms that have been approved by the applicable state regulatory commissions. The performance obligations for these transportation customers are satisfied by means of transporting customer-supplied gas to the designated location. Revenue is recognized and our performance obligation is satisfied over time when natural gas is delivered to the customer. Management determined that these arrangements qualify for the invoice practical expedient for recognizing revenue. For demand fee arrangements, revenue is recognized and our performance obligation is satisfied by standing ready to transport natural gas over the period of each individual month. 
 Alternative Revenue Program Revenues 
 of the difference between the total non-tariffed revenues earned during a test period and a revenue benchmark established by the RRC. With the completion of APT's most recent rate case in December 2023, the revenue benchmark was increased from million to million. Differences between actual revenues and revenues calculated under these mechanisms adjust the amount billed to customers. These mechanisms are considered to be alternative revenue programs under accounting standards generally accepted in the United States as they are deemed to be contracts between us and our regulator. Accordingly, revenue under these mechanisms are excluded from revenue from contracts with customers.

 Texas 
 In Texas, we recorded a billion regulatory asset in fiscal 2021 for costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri. In 2021, the Texas Legislature passed House Bill 1520, which authorized the RRC to issue a statewide securitization financing order directing the Texas Public Finance Authority (TPFA) to issue bonds (customer rate relief bonds) for gas utilities that chose to participate to recover extraordinary costs incurred to secure gas supply and to provide service during Winter Storm Uri, and to restore gas utility systems after that event, thereby providing rate relief to customers by extending the period during which these extraordinary costs would otherwise be recovered and supporting the financial strength and stability of gas utility companies. 
 In March 2023, the Texas Natural Gas Securitization Finance Corporation (the Finance Corporation), with the authority of the TPFA, issued billion in customer rate relief bonds with varying scheduled final maturities from to years. The bonds are obligations of the Finance Corporation, payable from the customer rate relief charges and other bond collateral, and are not an obligation of Atmos Energy. We collected billion of this amount and relieved the regulatory asset.

 reportable segments: 
 The distribution segment is comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in states. 
 The pipeline and storage segment is comprised primarily of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana. 
 Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic operating units under which we manage sales of various products and services to customers. Although our distribution segment operations are geographically dispersed, they are aggregated and reported as a single segment as each natural gas distribution division has similar economic characteristics. In addition, because the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana have similar economic characteristics, they have been aggregated and reported as a single segment. 
 The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on net income or loss of the respective operating units. We allocate interest and pension expense to the pipeline and storage segment; however, there is no debt or pension liability recorded on the pipeline and storage segment balance sheet. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated; however, we have not eliminated intercompany profits when such amounts are probable of recovery under the affiliates rate regulation process. Income taxes are allocated to each segment as if each segment s income taxes were calculated on a separate return basis.

 Winter Storm Uri Financing 
 A historic winter storm impacted supply, market pricing and demand for natural gas in our service territories in mid-February 2021. We experienced unforeseeable and unprecedented market pricing for gas costs, which resulted in aggregated natural gas purchases in February 2021 of approximately billion. These gas costs were paid using funds received from a public offering of debt securities completed in March 2021 of billion. On March 3, 2023, we entered into a term loan agreement for a billion senior unsecured term loan facility and used the proceeds, along with cash on hand, to repay at maturity the outstanding billion senior notes that matured on March 9, 2023. On March 23, 2023, we received proceeds from the Finance Corporation in the amount of billion and repaid the term loan. 
 Short-term Debt 
 We utilize short-term debt to provide cost-effective, short-term financing until it can be replaced with a balance of long-term debt and equity financing that achieves the Company s desired capital structure. Our short-term borrowing requirements are driven primarily by construction work in progress and the seasonal nature of the natural gas business. 
 Our short-term borrowing requirements are satisfied through a combination of a billion commercial paper program and committed revolving credit facilities with third-party lenders that provide billion of total working capital funding. 
 The primary source of our funding is our commercial paper program, which is supported by a unsecured billion credit facility that was replaced on March 28, 2024, with a new senior unsecured billion credit facility that expires on March 28, 2029. This new facility bears interest at a base rate or at a Term SOFR-based rate for the applicable interest period, plus a margin ranging from percent to percent for base rate advances or a margin ranging from percent to percent for Term SOFR-based advances, based on the Company s credit ratings. Additionally, the facility contains a million accordion feature, which provides the opportunity to increase the total committed loan to billion. At September 30, 2024, there were amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. At September 30, 2023, there was million outstanding under our commercial paper program. 
 We also had a million unsecured revolving credit facility, which was replaced on March 28, 2024, with a new billion senior unsecured credit facility, which expires March 28, 2027 and is used to provide additional working capital funding. This new facility bears interest at a base rate or at a Term SOFR-based rate for the applicable interest period, plus a margin ranging from percent to percent for base rate advances or a margin ranging from percent to percent for Term SOFR-based advances, based on the Company's credit ratings. Additionally, the facility contains a million accordion feature, which provides the opportunity to increase the total committed loan to billion. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were borrowings outstanding under this facility. 
 Additionally, we have a million -day unsecured facility, which was renewed April 1, 2024 and is used to provide working capital funding. There were borrowings outstanding under this facility as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Finally, we have a million -day unsecured revolving credit facility, which was renewed March 31, 2024 and is used to issue letters of credit and to provide working capital funding. At September 30, 2024, there were borrowings outstanding under the new facility; however, outstanding letters of credit reduced the total amount available to us to million.

 These credit facilities and our public indentures contain usual and customary covenants for our business, including covenants substantially limiting liens, substantial asset sales, and mergers. Additionally, our public debt indentures relating to our senior notes and debentures, as well as certain of our revolving credit agreements, each contain a default provision that is triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of million to in excess of million becomes due by acceleration or is not paid at maturity. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. If we were unable to comply with our debt covenants, we would likely be required to repay our outstanding balances on demand, provide additional collateral or take other corrective actions.

 million of Series 2023-A Senior Secured Securitized Utility Tariff Bonds with a term of years and semi-annual payments of principal and interest. The net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, of million were primarily used to purchase the Securitized Utility Tariff Property from Atmos Energy for million. The bonds are governed by an indenture between AEK and the indenture trustee. The indenture contains certain covenants that restrict AEK's ability to sell, transfer, convey, exchange or otherwise dispose of its assets. AEK's assets cannot be used to settle Atmos Energy's obligations, and the holders of the Securitized Utility Tariff Bonds have no recourse against Atmos Energy. 
 Because AEK's equity at risk is less than 1 of its total assets, it is considered to be a variable interest entity. Atmos Energy has the power to direct the most significant financial and operating activities of AEK, including billing, collections and remittance of customer cash receipts to enable AEK to service the principal and interest payments due under the Securitized Utility Tariff Bonds. Atmos Energy also has the obligation to absorb losses and rights to receive returns from AEK. Therefore, Atmos Energy is the primary beneficiary of AEK, and as a result, AEK is included in the consolidated financial statements of Atmos Energy. gain or loss was recognized upon initial consolidation. 
 The Securitized Utility Tariff Property that was acquired by AEK is classified as a securitized intangible asset on our consolidated balance sheets. This securitized intangible asset will be amortized over years, the estimated period needed to collect the required amounts from Atmos Energy's customers to service the Securitized Utility Tariff Bonds, with a remaining weighted average amortization period of years as of September 30, 2024. The amortization expense related to the securitized intangible asset is included in depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

 Defined Benefit Plans 
 Employee Pension Plan 
 As of September 30, 2024, we maintained one cash balance defined benefit plan, the Atmos Energy Corporation Pension Account Plan (the Pension Plan). The Pension Plan was established effective January 1999 and covers most of the employees of Atmos Energy that were hired on or before September 30, 2010. Effective October 1, 2010, the Pension Plan was closed to new participants. The assets of the Pension Plan are held within the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the Master Trust). 
 Opening account balances were established for participants as of January 1999 equal to the present value of their respective accrued benefits under the pension plans which were previously in effect as of December 31, 1998. The Pension Plan credits an allocation to each participant s account at the end of each year according to a formula based on the participant s age, service, and total pay (excluding incentive pay). In addition, at the end of each year, a participant s account is credited with interest on the employee s prior year account balance. Participants are fully vested in their account balances after of service and may choose to receive their account balances as a lump sum or an annuity. 
 Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), including the funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. 
 During fiscal 2024 and 2023, we contributed million and million in cash to the Pension Plan to achieve a desired level of funding while maximizing the tax deductibility of this payment. Based upon market conditions at September 30, 2024, the current funded position of the Pension Plan, and the funding requirements under the PPA, we do not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal 2025. However, we may consider whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels. 
 We make investment decisions and evaluate performance of the assets in the Master Trust on a medium-term horizon of at least three to . We also consider our current financial status when making recommendations and decisions regarding the Master Trust s assets. Finally, we strive to ensure the Master Trust s assets are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk and meet the Master Trust s long-term asset investment policy adopted by the Qualified Retirement Plans and Trusts Committee, comprised of a group of executives appointed by the Board of Directors to oversee the Company's employee pension plan, defined contribution plan and postretirement benefit plan. 
 To achieve these objectives, we invest the Master Trust s assets in equity securities, fixed income securities, interests in commingled pension trust funds, other investment assets, and cash and cash equivalents. Investments in equity securities are diversified among the market s various subsectors in an effort to diversify risk and maximize returns. Fixed income securities are invested in investment grade securities. Cash equivalents are invested in securities that either are short term (less than 180 days) or readily convertible to cash with modest risk.

 In August 1998, we adopted the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) (formerly known as the Performance-Based Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan), which covers all corporate officers selected to participate in the plan between August 12, 1998 and August 5, 2009. The SERP is a defined benefit arrangement which provides a benefit equal to percent of covered compensation under which benefits paid from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the benefits under the SERP. 
 Effective August 5, 2009, we adopted a new defined benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the 2009 SERP), for corporate officers or any other employees selected at the discretion of the Board. Under the 2009 SERP, a nominal account has been established for each participant, to which the Company contributes at the end of each calendar year an amount equal to percent percent for members of the Management Committee appointed on or after January 1, 2016) of the total of each participant s base salary and cash incentive compensation earned during each prior calendar year, beginning December 31, 2009.

 Postretirement Benefits Plan 
 We sponsor the Retiree Medical Plan for Retirees and Disabled Employees of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Retiree Medical Plan). This plan provides medical and prescription drug protection to all qualified participants based on their date of retirement. The Retiree Medical Plan provides different levels of benefits depending on the level of coverage chosen by the participants and the terms of predecessor plans. Effective January 1, 2022, the Retiree Medical Plan was amended to change the post-65 retiree coverage to Via Benefits with an Atmos Energy funded Health Reimbursement Account. Eligible post-65 retirees and post-65 spouses will be able to elect coverage through Via Benefits, including those that previously deferred or declined retiree coverage. 
 Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of ERISA. However, additional voluntary contributions are made annually as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. We expect to contribute between million and million to our Retiree Medical Plan during fiscal 2025.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy Corporation 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Atmos Energy Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Atmos Energy Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated November 18, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
 
 The following summary of the common stock, no par value per share (the common stock ), of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Company is based on and qualified by reference to, the Company s Restated Articles of Incorporation filed in Texas and Virginia (the Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws ). For a complete description of the terms and provisions of the Company s equity securities, including its common stock, refer to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, each of which are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 General 
 
 Our authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value. Each of our shares of common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters voted upon by shareholders. Our shareholders do not have cumulative voting rights. With respect to any matter, other than a matter for which the affirmative vote of the holders of a specified portion of common stock may be required by law or our Articles of Incorporation, an act of the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on a matter and represented in person or by proxy at a meeting at which a quorum is present. The power to alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws, and to adopt new Bylaws, is vested in our Board of Directors, subject to repeal or change by the affirmative vote of the holders of 75 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon. Our issued and outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the shares of our common stock, and such shares are not entitled to any preemptive rights. Since we are incorporated in both Texas and Virginia, we must comply with the laws of both states when issuing shares of our common stock. 
 
 Holders of our shares of common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors from our assets legally available for the payment of dividends and, upon our liquidation, a pro rata share of all of our assets available for distribution to our shareholders.

 Charter and Bylaws Provisions 
 
 Some provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect. The following description of these provisions is only a summary, and we refer you to our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws for more information. 

Cumulative Voting. Our Articles of Incorporation prohibit cumulative voting. In general, in the absence of cumulative voting, one or more persons who hold a majority of our outstanding shares can elect all of the directors who are subject to election at any meeting of shareholders. 
 
 Removal of Directors. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws also provide that our directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 percent of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. 
 
 Fair Price Provisions. Article VII of our Articles of Incorporation provides certain Fair Price Provisions for our shareholders. Under Article VII, a merger, consolidation, sale of assets, share exchange, recapitalization or other similar transaction, between us or a company controlled by or under common control with us and any individual, corporation or other entity which, alone or together with its affiliates or associates, owns or controls 10 percent or more of our voting capital stock, would be required to satisfy the condition that the aggregate consideration per share to be received in the transaction for each class of our voting capital stock be at least equal to the highest per share price, or equivalent price for any different classes or series of stock, paid by the 10 percent shareholder in acquiring any of its holdings of our stock. If a proposed transaction with a 10 percent shareholder does not meet this condition, then the transaction must be approved by the holders of at least 75 percent of the outstanding shares of voting capital stock held by our shareholders other than the 10 percent shareholder, unless a majority of the directors who were members of our board immediately prior to the time the 10 percent shareholder involved in the proposed transaction became a 10 percent shareholder have either 
 
 expressly approved in advance the acquisition of the outstanding shares of our voting capital stock that caused the 10 percent shareholder to become a 10 percent shareholder or 
 
 approved the transaction either in advance of or subsequent to the 10 percent shareholder becoming a 10 percent shareholder. 
 
 The provisions of Article VII may not be amended, altered, changed, or repealed except by the affirmative vote of at least 75 percent of the votes entitled to be cast thereon at a meeting of our shareholders duly called for consideration of such amendment, alteration, change, or repeal. In addition, if there is a 10 percent shareholder, such action must also be approved by the affirmative vote of at least 75 percent of the outstanding shares of our voting capital stock held by the shareholders other than the 10 percent shareholder. 
 
 Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations. Our Bylaws include provisions setting forth specific conditions and restrictions under which business may be transacted at meetings of shareholders. For example, no business may be transacted at a meeting unless it is (a) specified in the notice of meeting, (b) otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or (c) brought before the meeting by a shareholder of record who provided notice and other specified information in writing to the corporate secretary not earlier than the 120th day and no later than the 90th day before the one-year anniversary of the date of the previous year s annual meeting. These provisions may restrict the content of the issues to be discussed at a shareholders meeting.

 Exhibit 19 
 
 August 6, 2024 
 
 Insider Trading Policy 

Purpose Atmos Energy Corporation (including its subsidiaries, Atmos Energy or the Company prides itself in promoting and maintaining a culture in which sound, ethical business standards and practices are the norm. Such a culture promotes the confidence of our shareholders and the public markets in the Company, and maintaining this confidence is extremely important. One of the ways in which investor confidence is maintained is through practicing a policy which prohibits the misuse by the directors, officers, and employees of Atmos Energy of material financial or other information that has not been publicly disclosed. This policy not only ensures fairness to the investing public, but further promotes compliance with applicable federal securities laws, which can impose strict penalties on both companies and individuals who violate those laws. 
 
 Definitions Atmos Energy Securities include common stock of Atmos Energy as well as any other securities issued by Atmos Energy and derivative securities, whether or not issued by Atmos Energy, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss, manage risk or benefit from changes in the share price of Atmos Energy common stock, such as options. The term also includes debt securities such as bonds and notes. 
 
 Company Persons are directors, officers, and employees of Atmos Energy, as well as others, such as contractors or consultants who have access to MNPI, whom Atmos Energy has notified of such status. 
 
 Compliance Officers are the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary Corporate Secretary and the Associate General Counsel and Assistant Corporate Secretary Assistant Corporate Secretary of Atmos Energy. The Corporate Secretary s primary responsibilities as a Compliance Officer include, but are not limited to, assisting the Assistant Corporate Secretary, when necessary, in the administration of the Atmos Energy insider trading prevention program and compliance with this Policy. The Assistant Corporate Secretary s primary responsibilities as a Compliance Officer include, but are not limited to, providing guidance on Section 16 issues and pre-clearance matters, supervising the preparation and filing of Section 16 reports, providing notification of trading blackout periods, monitoring developments in the securities laws that may require changes to or modifications of this Policy, and generally administering the Atmos Energy insider trading prevention program and compliance with this Policy. 
 
 MNPI stands for material non-public information. Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell securities. Any information that could reasonably be expected to affect the price of securities is material. The following are common examples of material information 

Exhibit 19 
 
 August 6, 2024 
 
 Insider Trading Policy 

Projections of future earnings or losses 
 Financial results 
 News of a pending or proposed merger, acquisition or tender offer 
 News of a significant sale of assets or the disposition of a subsidiary 
 Changes in dividend policies, the declaration of a stock split or the offering of additional securities 
 A change in management 
 Impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems 
 New major contracts, orders, suppliers, customers or finance sources, or the loss thereof 
 A significant cybersecurity event at the Company 
 
 Both positive and negative information can be material. Because trading that receives scrutiny will be evaluated after the fact with the benefit of hindsight, questions concerning the materiality of particular information should be resolved in favor of materiality and trading should be avoided. 
 
 Information that is not generally known or available to the public is considered to be nonpublic information. Information is considered to be available to the public only when it has been released broadly to the marketplace (such as through a press release, a filing with the SEC or a publicly-accessible and pre-announced meeting or conference call) and the investing public has had sufficient time to fully absorb the information. As a general rule, information is considered nonpublic until after one full trading day after the information is released. Therefore, no director, officer, or employee of Atmos Energy may engage in any transactions involving Atmos Energy Securities until after one full trading day after the information has been released, subject to the additional restrictions outlined below. 
 
 Related Person means, with respect to any person 
 Such person s spouse 
 Such person s minor children 
 Any other person who lives in such person s household and 
 Any other person who does not live in such person s household but whose transactions in Atmos Energy Securities are directed by such person or are subject to such person s direct or indirect control e.g. , parents, children, or friends who consult with such person before they trade in Atmos Energy Securities). 
 
 In addition, the term Related Person includes any entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by such person e.g. , a corporation in which such person owns a majority of the voting stock, a limited partnership in which such person is a general partner, a trust in which such person is the trustee, or an estate in which such person is an executor). 
 
 SEC is the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the chief enforcement agency of the federal securities laws. 

Exhibit 19 
 
 August 6, 2024 
 
 Insider Trading Policy 

Selected Personnel includes employees who are likely to have access to MNPI. The Compliance Officers determine annually those employees who are considered Selected Personnel. The Compliance Officers notify Selected Personnel that they are considered Selected Personnel and their obligations with respect to blackout periods. 

Trades or transactions include, among other things 
 purchases and sales of Atmos Energy Securities in public markets or private transactions 
 sales of Atmos Energy Securities obtained through the exercise of employee stock options granted by the Company, including broker assisted cashless exercise (i.e., the broker selling some or all of the shares underlying the option on the open market) or 
 making gifts of Atmos Energy Securities (including charitable donations). 
 
 Conversely, references to trades and transactions do not include 
 the exercise of Atmos Energy stock options if no shares are to be sold or if there is a net exercise (i.e., the use of the underlying shares to pay the exercise price and or tax withholding obligations) 
 the vesting of Atmos Energy stock options, restricted stock or restricted stock units 
 the withholding of shares to satisfy a tax withholding obligation upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units 
 transferring shares to an entity that does not involve a change in the beneficial ownership of the shares (for example, transferring shares from one brokerage account to another brokerage account controlled by the Company Person) 
 sales of Atmos Energy Securities as a selling stockholder in a registered public offering in accordance with applicable securities laws or 
 any other purchase of Atmos Energy Securities from the Company or sales of Atmos Energy Securities to the Company in accordance with applicable securities and state laws. 
 
 Dividend reinvestment plan 
 To the extent Company Persons participate in the Company s dividend reinvestment plan, this Policy will not apply to purchases of Atmos Energy stock under the plan resulting from such election to reinvest dividends made when outside of a blackout period (if applicable to the Company Person) and such Company Person is not aware of MNPI. However, this Policy does apply to any (a) election to participate in the plan (b) increase or decrease in the level of participation in the plan and (c) sale of Atmos Energy stock purchased pursuant to the plan. 
 
 Retirement Savings Plan 
 This Policy does not apply to purchases of Atmos Energy stock in the Company s Retirement Savings Plan resulting from periodic contributions to the plan by 

Exhibit 19 
 
 August 6, 2024 
 
 Insider Trading Policy 

Company Persons pursuant to a payroll deduction election made when outside of a blackout period (if applicable to the Company Person) and such Company Person is not aware of MNPI. However, this Policy will apply to any election made to (a) begin or terminate investing in Atmos Energy stock in the Retirement Savings Plan (b) change the investment allocation of Atmos Energy Securities in the Retirement Savings Plan (c) make an intra-plan transfer of an existing account balance into or out of the fund for Atmos Energy stock (d) liquidate some or all of an investment in Atmos Energy stock in the Retirement Savings Plan (e) borrow money, to the extent otherwise permitted, against a Retirement Savings Plan account if the loan will result in a liquidation of some or all of the Atmos Energy stock and (f) prepay a Retirement Savings Plan loan if the prepayment will result in allocation of loan proceeds to Atmos Energy stock. 
 
 Policy No Company Persons, or Related Persons of Company Persons, while aware of MNPI about Atmos Energy, may trade Atmos Energy Securities. This policy also applies to trading in the securities of other companies with which Atmos Energy has a business relationship, such as customers or suppliers Business Partners ), when a Company Person is aware of information about such Business Partner as a result of the Company Person s employment or other relationship with Atmos Energy. 
 
 Additionally, no MNPI may be passed on to others by any Company Persons, nor may they recommend to anyone the purchase or sale of securities when they are aware of such information. This practice, known as tipping, also violates the federal securities laws and may result in the same civil and criminal penalties that apply to insider trading, even though the person doing the tipping did not trade and did not gain any benefit from another s trading. 
 
 No personal financial emergency excuses lack of compliance with this policy. Even the appearance of an improper transaction must be avoided to preserve the Company s reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct. 
 
 Directors, officers, and Selected Personnel are required to annually certify to the Compliance Officers their knowledge of and intent to comply with this policy. Company Persons are ultimately responsible for adhering to this policy and for assuring that any Related Person also complies with this Policy. 
 
 Blackout Quarterly Trading Blackout Periods 
 Periods Atmos Energy s announcement of its quarterly financial results almost always has the potential to have a material effect on the market for Atmos Energy Securities. Accordingly, to avoid even the appearance of trading on the basis of MNPI, Atmos Energy s directors, officers, and Selected Personnel may not trade in Atmos Energy Securities during the period which generally begins two weeks before the end of each fiscal quarter and ends after one full trading day following the release of Atmos 

Exhibit 19 
 
 August 6, 2024 
 
 Insider Trading Policy 

Energy s earnings for that quarter. Advance notification of the beginning and ending of a quarterly trading blackout period will be provided by the Compliance Officers. 
 
 Interim Earnings Guidance and Event-Specific Trading Blackout Periods 
 Atmos Energy may from time to time impose other trading blackout periods, such as when it issues interim earnings guidance or other potentially material information by means of a press release, an SEC filing on Form 8-K, or other means designed to achieve widespread dissemination of the information. Trading blackout periods may also be imposed for specific events which may only be known only to a few directors, executives, and other employees, such as the occurrence of a significant cybersecurity event, or trading blackout periods may be imposed on all transactions in a specific employee benefit plan such as the Retirement Savings Plan. It should be anticipated that trading will be blacked out while Atmos Energy is in the process of assembling the information to be released and until the information has been released and fully absorbed by the market. The Compliance Officers will notify anyone affected by such a trading blackout period. 
 
 Preclearance All directors, officers, and Selected Personnel, and Related Persons of the foregoing, 
 Requirements must seek pre-clearance from a Compliance Officer (and for directors, the Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary must pre-clear) prior to conducting any of the following 
 
 Purchasing or selling Atmos Energy Securities 
 Selling Atmos Energy Securities held in the Retirement Savings Plan or any other incentive plan 
 Changing the investment allocation of Atmos Energy Securities in the Retirement Savings Plan or any other incentive plan 
 Borrowing funds from the Retirement Savings Plan or any other incentive plan if the loan may result in a liquidation of Atmos Energy Securities 
 Any pledge or hypothecation of Atmos Energy Securities

 August 6, 2024 
 
 Insider Trading Policy 

Pre-Clearance Requirement 
 The 10b5-1 plan must be reviewed and approved in advance by a Compliance Officer at least 5 business days prior to the entry into the plan. 
 
 Time of Adoption 
 In addition to the pre-clearance requirement described above, a 10b5-1 plan may only be adopted at a time when 
 
 The person entering into the 10b5-1 plan is not aware of any MNPI and 
 No blackout period is in effect. 
 
 Plan Instructions 
 Any 10b5-1 plan must be in writing, signed, and either 
 
 Specify the amount, price and date of the sales (or purchases) of Atmos Energy Securities to be effected 
 Provide a formula, algorithm or computer program for determining when to sell (or purchase) Atmos Energy Securities, the quantity to sell (or purchase) and the price or 
 delegate decision-making authority with regard to these transactions to a broker or other agent without any MNPI about Atmos Energy or Atmos Energy Securities. 
 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the person entering into the 10b5-1 plan may not subsequently influence how, when or whether to effect purchases or sales with respect to the Atmos Energy Securities subject to a 10b5-1 plan. 
 
 Good Faith Requirements 
 The person entering into the 10b5-1 plan must be entering into such plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions or Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. This must be true as of the time of adoption of the 10b5-1 plan and is also required throughout the duration of the plan.

Exhibit 19 
 
 August 6, 2024 
 
 Insider Trading Policy 

For directors and Section 16 Officers the later of (a) two business days following the filing of the Form 10-Q or Form 10-K for the completed fiscal quarter in which the 10b5-1 plan was adopted and (b) 90 calendar days after adoption of the 10b5-1 plan provided, however, that the cooling-off period shall in no event exceed 120 days.

 Single Transaction Plans 
 A person may not enter into more than one 10b5-1 plan designed to effect the open-market purchase or sale of the total amount of Atmos Energy Securities as a single transaction during any rolling 12-month period, subject to certain exceptions. A 10b5-1 plan is designed to effect the purchase or sale of Atmos Energy Securities as a single transaction when the terms of the plan would, for practical purposes, directly or indirectly require execution in a single transaction. 
 
 No Hedging 
 The person entering into the 10b5-1 plan must not have entered into or altered a corresponding or hedging transaction or position with respect to the Atmos Energy Securities subject to the 10b5-1 plan and must agree not to enter into any such transaction while the 10b5-1 plan is in effect. 
 
 Modifications and Terminations 
 Modifications amendments and terminations of an existing 10b5-1 plan are strongly discouraged due to legal risks, and can affect the validity of trades that have taken place under the plan prior to such modification amendment or termination. Any modification amendment to the amount, price, or timing of the purchase or sale of the Atmos Energy Securities underlying the 10b5-1 plan will be deemed to be a termination of the current 10b5-1 plan and creation of a new 10b5-1 plan. If a person is considering ministerial changes to a 10b5-1 trading plan, such as changing the account information, such person should consult with the Compliance Officers in advance to confirm that any such change does not constitute an effective termination of such plan. 
 
 As such, the modification amendment of an existing 10b5-1 trading plan is subject to the review and approval by the Compliance Officers in accordance with the pre-clearance procedures set forth above, and will be subject to all the other requirements set forth in this policy regarding the adoption of a new 10b5-1 plan. 
 
 The termination (other than through an amendment or modification) of an existing 10b5-1 plan is subject to the review and approval by the Compliance Officers. Except in limited circumstances, the termination of a 10b5-1 plan will not be approved unless 

Exhibit 19 
 
 August 6, 2024 
 
 Insider Trading Policy 

The 10b5-1 plan will be terminated at a time when the person is not aware of MNPI and 
 No trading blackout period is in effect. 
 
 Atmos Energy is required to disclose whether any Section 16 Officer has adopted, modified or terminated a 10b5-1 plan in its Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC, along with the material terms of such plan, other than the price.
