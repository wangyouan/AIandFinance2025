TRANSFER
AGENT AND REGISTRAR 

As
of the date of this filing, we have engaged Vstock Transfer, LLC as our Company transfer agent. 

PENNY
STOCK REGULATIONS 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets more than 1,000,000, or annual incomes
exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

DIVIDEND
POLICY 

Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our
Board of Directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no contractual obligations or restrictions to declare
or pay dividends on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our Board of Directors
currently intends to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future. 

SECURITIES
AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS 

We
have not established any compensation plans under which equity securities are authorized for issuance.

CONCERN 

For
the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 334,397 and used cash in operations of 235,188. These factors,
among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that
its financial statements are issued. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report
on the Company s September 30, 2024, audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. The Company s financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management
estimates that the current funds on hand will be sufficient to continue operations through the next six months. The Company s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue to implement its business plan to increase its customer base
and realize increased revenues. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that
it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may
contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the
case of equity financing. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

USE
OF ESTIMATES 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates for assumptions used in impairment testing of long-term assets and the
accrual of potential liabilities. 

REVENUE
RECOGNITION 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, following the five-step model prescribed by ASC 606 , which
includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or
agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5)
recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is
probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients. 

The Company s revenue consists of revenue from delivering online
and in-person media and leadership training courses. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are delivered, in an amount
that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. The Company recognizes revenue from
subscription services ratably over the subscription period. The Company recognizes deferred revenue at each period end for contracts that
have been paid but which the related service has not been performed or delivered. The Company offers no discounts, rebates, rights of
return, or other allowances to clients which would result in the establishment of reserves against service revenue.

DISCLOSURE
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, we are responsible
for conducting an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report. Disclosure
controls and procedures means that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company,
including any consolidating subsidiaries, and was made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period when
this report was being prepared. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and financial officer concluded as of the evaluation
date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting as described below. 

MANAGEMENT S
ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2024, based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) (COSO). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of September
30, 2024, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting was not effective. 

We
identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

The
material weaknesses identified include (i) the Company did not maintain a functioning independent audit committee and did not maintain
an independent board; (ii) the Company had inadequate segregation of duties; and (iii) the Company had an insufficient number of personnel
with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience and ongoing training in the application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure
requirements commensurate with the Company s financial reporting requirements. 

Notwithstanding
the identified material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
disclosed in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

Planned
remediation of material weaknesses 

Management
is actively engaged in developing and implementing remediation plans to address the material weaknesses described above. These remediation
efforts are ongoing and include or are expected to include preparation of written documentation of our internal control policies and
procedures, and to increase personnel and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function. 

CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered independent

ITEM
10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

Biographical
information regarding the sole officer and director of the Company is provided below: 

NAME 
 
 AGE 
 
 POSITION 
 
 Hsu
 Shou Hung 
 
 56 
 
 President,
 Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chairman of Board of Directors 

The
sole officer and director named above will serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders or until his respective resignation
or removal from office. Thereafter, directors are anticipated to be elected for one-year terms at the annual stockholders meeting.
Officers will hold their positions at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, absent any employment agreement, of which none currently
exists or is contemplated. 

Set
forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of our sole officer and director. 

Mr.
Hsu has been our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director since the Company s incorporation. Mr. Hsu has over
20 years of management experience. From 1999 to 2009, he was the general manager of Lead International Financial Advisory Co., Ltd.,
a company focusing on international financial products sales. From 2003 to 2005, he was a Distinguished Lecturer at Fuxin Enterprise
Management Consulting CO., Ltd. From 2005 to 2007, he was a Distinguished Lecturer at Guangzhou Benchmark Enterprise Management Co.,
Ltd. From 2008 to 2009 he was a Distinguished Lecturer at Beijing Wenhe Fanglue Information Co., Ltd. From 2012 to 2016, Mr. Hsu was

TERM
OF OFFICE 

All
directors hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company and until their successors have been duly elected
and qualified. The Company s Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors will consist of no less than three members. Officers are
elected by and serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

10 

DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE 

Our
Board of Directors is currently composed of one member who does not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published
listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market (though the Company may have a plan to list on the NASDAQ Global Market later). The
NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least
three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business
dealings with us. In addition, our Board of Directors has not made a subjective determination as to our director that no relationships
exist which, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the
responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our Board of Directors made
these determinations, our Board of Directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by our director and us regarding
to our director s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. 

CERTAIN
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

No
director, nominee for director, or executive officer of the Company has appeared as a party in any legal proceeding material to an evaluation
of his ability or integrity during the past five years. 

SIGNIFICANT
EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS 

Other
than our sole officer and director, we currently have no other significant employees. 

AUDIT
COMMITTEE AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by
such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit
committee financial expert, nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such
committees are not necessary since the Company is an early exploration stage company and has only two directors, and to date, such directors
have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers
have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions. 

There
are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above, we are not aware of any other conflicts of
interest with any of our executive officers or directors. 

SECTION
16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent
of a registered class of our equity securities, file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers,
directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Specific due dates for these reports have been established and the Company is required to report in this report any failure to file by
these dates. 

All
filing requirements were satisfied by the Company s officers, directors, and ten-percent holders. 

In
making these statements, we have relied on the written representation of our officers and directors or copies of the reports that they
have filed with the Commission. 

11 

CODE
OF ETHICS 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

SHAREHOLDER
PROPOSALS 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of DFP Holdings Limited 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of DFP Holdings Limited (the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in
Note 1 to the financial statements, during the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss and used cash in
operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in relation to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

and used cash in operations of . These factors, among others,
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that these financial
statements are issued. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management
estimates that the current funds on hand will be sufficient to continue operations through the next six months. The Company s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue to implement its business plan to increase its customer base
and realize increased revenues. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that
it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may
contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the
case of equity financing.

The
provisions of ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes , require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence
when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, based
on all available objective evidence, including the existence of cumulative losses, the Company determined that it was more likely than
not that the net deferred tax assets were not fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company established a full valuation allowance against
its net deferred tax assets. The Company intends to maintain a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive
evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance. 

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740, which requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that
a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any tax benefit can be recorded in the
financial statements. ASC 740 also provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, classification and interest and penalties related
to uncertain tax positions.
