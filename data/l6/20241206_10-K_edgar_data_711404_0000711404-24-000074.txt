 CooperVision is a global manufacturer providing products for contact lens wearers. CooperVision develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of single-use, two-week and monthly contact lenses, featuring advanced materials and optics. CooperVision designs its products to address vision challenges such as astigmatism, presbyopia and myopia with a broad collection of spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses. CooperVision offers contact lenses in materials like silicone hydrogel Aquaform technology. CooperVision also manufactures and markets myopia management products, including the internally developed MiSight 1 day lens, as well as other specialty eyecare products such as orthokeratology (ortho-k) and scleral lenses. In November 2019, the MiSight 1 day lens became the first and only product approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for slowing the progression of myopia in children aged 8-12 at the initiation of treatment, and in August 2021, CooperVision received Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approval for use of the MiSight 1 day lens in China. CooperVision s major manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in Belgium, Costa Rica, Hungary, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and the United States, with other smaller facilities in multiple locations around the world. 
 
 CooperSurgical offers a broad array of products and services focused on fertility and women's health. We categorize CooperSurgical product sales based on the point of health care delivery, which includes: products used in medical offices, ambulatory surgery centers and hospitals primarily by women's health providers including Obstetricians/Gynecologists (OB/GYN); and fertility products and services used primarily in fertility clinics. Our portfolio encompasses more than 600 products and services. Our medical devices are used in gynecology and obstetrics, including but not limited to surgical products, contraception and labor and delivery as well as cord blood and cord tissue storage services. Our fertility portfolio encompasses medical devices supporting the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process, egg and sperm donation, cryopreservation, and genomic services (including genetic testing). CooperSurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring companies, products and services that complement its business model. CooperSurgical's major manufacturing, cryostorage and distribution facilities are located in Costa Rica, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, with other smaller facilities in multiple locations around the world. 
 
 SEGMENT INFORMATION 
 
 CooperVision 
 
 CooperVision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions: the Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific. The two major product categories of contact lenses sold by CooperVision are: 
 
 Toric and multifocal lenses, including lenses that, in addition to correcting near- and farsightedness, address more complex visual defects such as astigmatism, myopia and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea; and 
 
 Spherical lenses, including lenses that correct near- and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects, myopia management lenses, which slow the progression of and correct myopia in age-appropriate children, and other specialty lenses. 
 
 In order to achieve a comfortable and healthier lens wearing experience, products are sold with recommended wearing and replacement schedules, often referred to as modalities, with the primary modalities being single-use lenses designed for one-day use and frequent replacement (FRP) lenses designed for two-week and monthly replacement. CooperVision offers spherical, toric, multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities and in a wide range of lens parameters. 
 
 CooperVision Product Modalities 
 
 7 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Frequent replacement lenses 
 
 Under the Biofinity brand, CooperVision markets monthly silicone hydrogel spherical (including Biofinity Energys), toric, multifocal and toric multifocal (made-to-order) lens products. Our Biofinity brand is CooperVision's highest grossing product. CooperVision also markets two-week silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses under the Avaira Vitality brand. 
 
 Single-use lenses 
 
 CooperVision markets single-use silicone hydrogel lenses under our MyDay brand and our clariti 1 day brand. The MyDay brand is our softest line of 1-day silicone hydrogel lenses and offers spherical (including MyDay Energys), toric, and multifocal lenses. The clariti 1-day brand is our most affordable line of silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses and offers spherical, toric, and multifocal lenses. CooperVision also offers traditional single-use hydrogel lenses under our Proclear and Biomedics brands. 
 
 CooperVision focuses on supporting the growth of all customers including key accounts (which include optical chains, global retailers, certain buying groups and mass merchandisers) by investing in selling, promotional and advertising activities. Further, we are increasing investment in our distribution and packaging capabilities to support the growth of our business and to continue providing quality service with our industry leading stock keeping unit range and customized offerings. 
 
 Market for Contact Lenses 
 
 The market for spherical lenses is growing with the addition of new value-added products, such as spherical lenses that may provide improved comfort for contact lens related dryness during lens wear and that add aspherical optical properties, more higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels, and myopia management contact lenses for children aged 8 to 12 years old. CooperVision believes that there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share, particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low. 
 
 We believe that myopia management opens up an attractive new market for contact lenses. With MiSight, we offer the only FDA approved 1 and first Chinese NMPA approved product to slow the progression of, and correct, myopia in age-appropriate children. This is a critical differentiator as the proactive management of myopia becomes standard-of-care within the eye care community to help reduce the progression of myopia in children, along with reducing the risks of long-term eye health problems associated with myopia such as cataracts, retinal detachment, and macular degeneration. We are investing to develop this new market by educating eye care practitioners, patients and their families, which increases awareness. 
 
 CooperVision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration of recently introduced products, and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets, both organically and through acquisitions. 
 
 CooperSurgical 
 
 CooperSurgical focuses on advancing fertility and women's health through a diversified portfolio including fertility products and services, medical devices, cryostorage (such as cord blood and cord tissue storage) and contraception. We offer quality products, innovative technologies and superior services to health care professionals and patients worldwide. CooperSurgical collaborates with health care professionals to identify products and new technologies to bring to market. The result is a broad portfolio of products and services that are intended to aid in the delivery of improved clinical outcomes for patients and are routinely used by health care professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of women's health and reproductive issues. 
 
 CooperSurgical distributes its products and services through OB/GYN and medical offices, hospital and ambulatory surgery centers and fertility clinics, as well as direct-to-consumer. A focus area for CooperSurgical is key accounts, which include large group practices, integrated delivery networks and certain buying groups within the office/surgical business and fertility clinic networks within the fertility business. We believe our portfolio of offerings and focus on service, quality and clinical education will help increase our share of business within these key account groups. 
 
 Since its inception in 1990, CooperSurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model. In fiscal 2024, CooperSurgical 
 
 1 MiSight 1 day (omafilcon A) soft (hydrophilic) contact lenses for daily wear are indicated for the correction of myopic ametropia and for slowing the progression of myopia in children with non-diseased eyes, who at the initiation of treatment are 8-12 years of age and have a refraction of -0.75 to -4.00 diopters (spherical equivalent) with 0.75 diopters of astigmatism. The lens is to be discarded after each removal.

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

acquired select Cook Medical assets focused primarily on the obstetrics, doppler monitoring, and gynecology surgery markets, a fertility company that specializes in sperm separation devices, and obp Surgical, a U.S.-based medical device company with a suite of single-use cordless surgical retractors with integrated light source and evacuation channels. We expect to continue investing in CooperSurgical's business, including through strategic transactions, with the goal of expanding our integrated solutions model within the areas of fertility and women's health. 
 
 CooperSurgical Product Categories 
 
 Office/Surgical 
 
 CooperSurgical sells a wide variety of innovative medical devices and services used in gynecology and obstetrics, including in labor and delivery, as well as to screen, diagnose and treat women's health and reproductive conditions. 
 
 CooperSurgical offers the cryostorage of newborn cord blood and cord tissue, which are potent sources of stem cells that have the potential for treatment and healing. Our newborn stem cell storage services are available in the United States, Canada and Australia. 
 
 Paragard is a hormone-free intrauterine device (IUD) offered by CooperSurgical that prevents pregnancy for up to ten years using copper as the only active ingredient. It is the only FDA approved non-hormonal IUD contraceptive option and is exclusively sold in the United States. 
 
 Fertility 
 
 CooperSurgical has broad product offerings for fertility evaluations and IVF procedures by OB/GYN professionals, reproductive endocrinologists and embryologists. In fertility clinics, our products include media, micro-tools and lab equipment. Additionally, CooperSurgical offers services to clinics and families undergoing assisted reproductive technologies including donor gametes, cryostorage, and genomic services. 
 
 Market for Fertility and Women's Health Care 
 
 CooperSurgical participates in the market for women's and family health care with its diversified product lines at various points of health care delivery: OB/GYN medical offices, hospitals and surgery centers, and fertility clinics. CooperSurgical s business also includes cryostorage services for gametes, cord blood and cord tissue. 
 
 CooperSurgical expects that OB/GYN medical offices and fertility clinics will continue to move away from private practice ownership and toward group practices, private equity, corporate or other ownership. As the consolidation trend continues it will have increased influence over supply chain control, group purchases, value analysis committees, product evaluation and procurement. We believe CooperSurgical's broad product portfolio can benefit in this changing environment as customers look to standardize and consolidate vendors. 
 
 Trends specific in the OB/GYN market include: 
 
 The increase in office-based and outpatient procedures, given increased access to care, high patient satisfaction, reduction of healthcare costs and comparative clinical outcomes. 
 
 A focus on reducing pregnancy and childbirth complications. 
 
 The obstetrician being a key contributor to stem cell storage, facilitating the collection of cord blood and cord tissue following delivery in most markets. 
 
 Initial evaluation and treatments for infertility, such as uterine assessment, ovulatory medications and intrauterine insemination (IUI), beginning with the OB/GYN and then transitioning to fertility clinics. 
 
 Trends specific in the fertility market include: 
 
 Infertility rates are increasing globally, and there is a significant unmet need for fertility products and services. 
 
 The maternal age is increasing. 
 
 Patient awareness of, and access to, services is increasing. 
 
 The number of fertility clinics is rising worldwide. 
 9 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Single parents by choice and LGBTQIA+ individuals are starting families. 
 
 Improved product offerings such as donor activity and cryopreservation services are becoming available. 
 
 Technology improvements are being developed for both male and female infertility challenges. 
 
 Worldwide disposable income is increasing. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 
 The markets in which we participate are highly competitive and involve the continual search for technological and scientific innovations. Competitive factors in these markets include technological and scientific advances, product quality and availability, price, customer service including response time and effective communication of product information to clinicians and consumers, and manufacturing processes. Competitors may have greater financial resources, larger research and development budgets, larger sales forces, greater market penetration and/or larger manufacturing capacity. Both CooperVision and CooperSurgical compete predominantly on the basis of product quality and differentiation, technological benefits, price, service levels and reliability. 
 
 CooperVision Competition 
 
 CooperVision's largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical, toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are Johnson Johnson Vision Care, Inc., Alcon Inc. and Bausch + Lomb. To a lesser extent, CooperVision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery. We believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous categories of the contact lens market, companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently. CooperVision competes in its markets by producing high, medium and low-volume lenses made with a variety of materials for a broader range of market niches, as well as offering a wide range of lens parameters, leading to a higher rate of successful fitting for practitioners and better visual acuity for patients. Our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving success in our business. We also compete based on our customer and professional services. 
 
 CooperSurgical Competition 
 
 CooperSurgical focuses on selected segments of the fertility and women's health care market with a diversified portfolio including fertility products and services, medical devices, cryostorage (such as cord blood and cord tissue storage) and contraception. CooperSurgical's strategy includes developing and acquiring new solutions to complement our current offerings. In the fertility market, CooperSurgical competes against Vitrolife Group, FujiFilm-Irvine Scientific, Hamilton Thorne, and Fairfax Cryobank and Fairfax EggBank. We also compete with fertility clinics offering their own services. Larger companies such as Johnson Johnson, Medtronic and Hologic have offerings that compete with our medical device products. In the stem cell storage field, we compete primarily with ViaCord, a division of Revvity, in the United States, as well as other smaller companies globally. With Paragard, we compete with manufacturers of hormonal IUDs including Bayer and AbbVie, Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives including Organon, and other forms of birth control. We are aware of a non-hormonal IUD under development, which may compete with Paragard in the future. Further, the continued consolidation of medical offices and fertility clinics may impact the competition for our products and services. 
 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
 The Company employs approximately 400 people in research and development. CooperVision's product development and clinical research is supported by internal and external specialists in lens design, formulation science, polymer chemistry, engineering, clinical trials, microbiology and biochemistry. CooperVision's research and development activities primarily include programs to develop new contact lens designs, myopia management, and manufacturing technologies, along with improving formulations and existing products. 
 
 CooperSurgical conducts research and development in-house, and works with external specialists when necessary, in mechanical, electrical, biomedical and software engineering, as well as life sciences. CooperSurgical research and development activities are focused on innovating, improving, and advancing our products and services including, instruments, devices, consumables, digital services, and manufacturing technologies.

 Medical Devices 
 
 Most of our products are medical devices, which must comply with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the regulations promulgated by the FDA thereunder. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes Class I, II or III depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure the medical device's safety and effectiveness. Both CooperVision and CooperSurgical develop and market medical devices subject to different levels of FDA regulation depending on the classification and risk profile of the device. Class III devices, such as extended wear contact lenses, require extensive premarket testing and approval, while Class I and II devices require lower levels of regulation. The majority of CooperSurgical's products are Class II devices. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the United States will require either premarket notification to the FDA requesting clearance for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, a premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA, or a de novo classification and request for marketing authorization submitted to and granted by the FDA. 
 
 If we are required to obtain a 510(k) clearance for a device that we wish to market, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a device commercially distributed in the United States before May 28, 1976 (a pre-amendments device), or to a device that was found to be substantially equivalent to a pre-amendments device. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA automatically designates the device as a Class III device. The sponsor of a device automatically designated as Class III must either fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements or request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process. The de novo process is a pathway to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. 
 
 A PMA application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification procedures, or if the device has been previously classified as Class III. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Prior to commencing human clinical trials, submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) and receipt of IDE approval from the FDA is required if the device under evaluation presents a significant risk to human health. The process of gathering supporting information leading up to PMA application, and the subsequent FDA review, can take several years. 
 
 A majority of the medical devices we currently market have received FDA clearance through the 510(k) process or approval through the PMA process. Because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop, or any product enhancements, will be exempt from the premarket clearance or approval requirements, or will be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process rather than the PMA process, significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur. 
 
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; the FDA's Quality System Regulation (QSR), which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, production, control, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or off-label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion; FDA unique device identifier regulations, which require changes to labeling and packaging; and medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections for cause by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations.

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

In the United States, under the FDCA and the FDA s regulatory framework, in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) are a type of medical device that can be used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases, such as cancer, or other conditions. The FDA considers Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) to be a subset of IVDs that are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. Furthermore, in May 2024, the FDA issued a final rule to amend its regulations to make explicit that LDTs are devices under the FDCA. Along with this amendment, the FDA is finalizing a policy under which the FDA will provide greater oversight of IVDs offered as LDTs through a phaseout of its general enforcement discretion approach for LDTs over the course of four years, as well as targeted enforcement discretion policies for certain categories of IVDs manufactured by laboratories. As we operate a genetic testing laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regulations, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory tests we perform and to comply with standards applicable to our operations, including test processes, personnel, facilities administration, equipment maintenance, recordkeeping, quality systems and proficiency testing. We have current certification under CLIA to perform testing at our New Jersey facility. In addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under CLIA, licensure is required and maintained for our laboratory under state law. 
 
 Human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products 
 
 We currently operate as a provider of donated reproductive tissue (eggs and sperm) for fertility treatments, fertility cryopreservation services and newborn stem cell storage. Eggs and sperm are regulated by the FDA as human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps). In addition, Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) authorizes the FDA to issue regulations with respect to HCT/Ps. To be regulated as a "361 HCT/P", the product must, among other things, be minimally manipulated and intended only for homologous uses. HCT/Ps regulated as 361 HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, and stringent requirements for processing, storing, labeling and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, record keeping and adverse event reporting, among other applicable requirements and laws. 361 HCT/Ps do not require 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, submission of a Biologics License Application, or other premarket authorization from the FDA before marketing. We believe our HCT/Ps are regulated as 361 HCT/Ps. 
 
 Pharmaceutical Products 
 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the FDCA and its implementing drug regulations. Although Paragard is a drug-device combination product, the FDA has determined that the primary mode of action for Paragard is the drug component and the product is therefore regulated by the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research under applicable drug regulations. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves numerous and time-consuming steps, including preclinical laboratory tests, human clinical trials, FDA reviews, and facility inspections. 
 
 Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to NDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA as the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. After approval of an NDA, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are also required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other requirements, including requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain ongoing compliance. In addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing, promotion and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 
 Foreign Regulation 
 
 Health authorities in foreign countries regulate Cooper's clinical studies and medical device sales. Even if the FDA has cleared or approved a product in the United States, the regulatory agencies or notified bodies in other countries must approve or certify new products and product modifications before they may be marketed in those countries. The regulations vary widely from country to country, although there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union (EU), United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries. Medical devices marketed or sold in the EU must meet the CE mark requirements and maintain certain certifications. CooperVision maintains ISO 13485 certification and CE marks for its products and CooperSurgical maintains ISO 13485 certification and CE marks for medical devices and ISO 15189 certification for the genomics laboratories. The ISO 13485 Quality Management System certification is now also required for registration of products in Asia Pacific and Latin American 
 12 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

countries, among many other requirements for registration in these countries. In order to maintain these quality benchmarks, the Company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures. 
 
 The EU rules below are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, while the majority of the United Kingdom now operates under a separate regulatory regime following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. 
 
 Medical Device and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation in the EU 
 
 Until May 25, 2021, medical devices sold in the EU were regulated by the Medical Device Directive (the EU MDD), which has been repealed and replaced by the EU MDR). Similarly, the EU has adopted the IVDR, which repealed and replaced the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (the EU IVDD) and became applicable on May 26, 2022. The majority of our current certificates have been granted under the EU MDD and the EU IVDD. Due to the unattainable nature of the deadlines for recertification of medical devices under the EU MDR and the EU IVDR, EU institutions have extended the transition periods for devices certified in accordance with the previous Directives, including the EU MDD and the EU IVDD, through legislative amendments of the transitional provisions of the EU MDR and EU IVDR. Therefore, devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU MDD and EU IVDD may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service provided that the requirements of transitional provisions are fulfilled. Pursuing marketing of medical devices (including IVDs) in the EU will require that our devices be certified under the new regimes set forth in the EU MDR and the EU IVDR. 
 
 In the EU, the safety and performance of medical devices (including IVDs) are evaluated by the designated notified bodies via the submission of technical dossiers, depending on the product classifications. A declaration of conformity to the MDD or MDR is drawn out as a basis for European conformity marking (CE Mark). All medical devices placed on the EU market must meet general safety and performance requirements, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and, where applicable, other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art. 
 
 Compliance with the general safety and performance requirements is also a prerequisite for CE mark, without which medical devices cannot be marketed or sold in the EU. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification. With certain exceptions, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of notified bodies, which are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. Typically, satisfactory completion of an audit and examinations of a product s technical dossiers and the manufacturer s quality system is required before the issuance of a certificate by the notified body. This certificate, along with the Declaration of Conformity, are then used by the manufacturer as basis for CE mark. 
 
 Throughout the term of the certificate, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. 
 
 In addition, all manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU are subject to various other regulations, including compliance with the EU medical device vigilance system, directives and requirements regarding the advertisement and promotion of medical devices and inspections rights of regulatory authorities. 
 
 Laboratory Developed Test Regulation in the EU 
 
 In the EU, LDTs were exempt from the regulations that govern medical devices and IVDs under certain conditions. In order to fall within this exemption under the EU IVDD, medical devices, including LDTs, had to be designed and used within such health institutions (which may include hospitals, laboratories and public health institutions that support the healthcare system and/or address patient needs but do not treat or care for patients directly) on a non-industrial scale, without being released into the market. While the legal framework for applying the exemption under the EU IVDD to LDTs was not entirely clear, the EU IVDR may provide greater clarity on the regulation of LDTs. 
 
 Our current and future tests will need to be assessed against the EU IVDR requirements. We will be required to comply with various certification and documentation criteria, and we will be subject to conformity assessments and audits by EU notified body and inspections by regulatory authorities. 
 
 Medical Devices and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulations in the United Kingdom 
 13 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Following the United Kingdom s withdrawal from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, EU laws no longer apply directly in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). Under the terms of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol agreed between the EU and United Kingdom, many EU laws, including those relating to medical devices and IVDs do still apply in Northern Ireland. 
 
 In Great Britain, the legislative regime currently continues to be based on the requirements set out in the EU MDD, the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (EU AIMDD), and the EU IVDD. However, substantial reforms to the Great Britain regulatory regime for medical devices and IVDs are currently being developed to improve patient safety. Most of the reforms are to align with EU MDR requirements, but the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) also intends to introduce unique requirements such as post market surveillance, software, and Artificial Intelligence from mid-2025. 
 
 Medical Device and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation in Asia Pacific 
 
 As in other regions, securing regulatory approvals in Asia Pacific is a critical aspect of commercializing our products. While medical device regulations in the Asia Pacific are based on similar regulatory fundamentals (such as risk-based classification of devices) as other regions, navigating the regulatory landscape in Asia Pacific is extremely complex. Medical device regulation in Asia Pacific differs significantly country by country, requiring specific regulatory affairs expertise in each country, as well as country-based regulatory strategies. The regulatory framework maturity in Asia Pacific is widely varied ranging from well-established to emerging, approval timelines can be lengthy and unpredictable and there is less access to and engagement with regulators compared to other markets. Several key Asia Pacific markets require regulatory approval in other countries prior to registration, increasing the time from completion of product development to product launch. For example, in China, manufacturers must provide proof of home country approval (such as the United States or EU) as part of the regulatory registration/approval process. 
 
 The NMPA regulates medical devices in China. Medical devices in China are classified by risk into Class I (lowest risk), Class II or Class III (highest risk). China requires physical testing (known as type testing of medical device samples by in-country testing centers to confirm compliance with specifications and standards, both pre- and post-market. Additionally, NMPA generally requires in-country clinical trials to support new product registrations, rather than relying on foreign clinical data. 
 
 In Japan, the primary regulation governing medical devices is the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act (PMD Act). The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) and the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (PMDA) regulate medical devices. The PMDA evaluates the safety and effectiveness of medical devices prior to granting marketing authorization or approval, and monitors post-market safety of approved devices. The PMDA is also the Quality Management System (QMS) Inspection Authority. Medical devices are placed into one of four risk classes based on potential risk, with Class I being the lowest potential risk and Class IV being the highest. Contact lenses, for example, are regulated as Class III devices and require premarket approval (registration), an expensive and lengthy process depending on the application category. A novel or new medical device application will generally require local clinical trial data, extending the time to approval. The registration process in Japan requires a QMS application and inspection. Additionally, separate from the registration process, a Foreign Manufacturer Registration is required before a company can import medical devices manufactured outside Japan. 
 
 Japan and Australia participate in the Medical Device Single Audit Program, which allows for the acceptance of QMS audit reports from other participating Regulatory Authorities, including the FDA. 
 
 Other Health Care Regulation 
 
 We are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and protect personal health-related information, including the following: 
 
 state, federal and similar foreign anti-kickback laws, which generally prohibit payments and other forms of remuneration to induce or in return for the purchase, lease, order or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of a product or service; 
 
 the federal physician self-referral law, known as the Stark Law, which generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to receive designated health services from an entity which the physician, or a member of the physician's immediate family, has a financial interest in; 
 
 the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits any individual or entity from presenting or causing to be presented false claims for payment to the federal government; 
 14 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

federal and state laws that prohibit executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to obtain money from any healthcare benefit program under false pretenses; 
 
 the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state and foreign laws that require medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose financial relationships with health care professionals and teaching hospitals; and 
 
 data privacy and security laws and regulations, such as the HIPAA and the EU GDPR, which are intended to protect the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information. 
 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 
 Market acceptance and sales of our CooperSurgical products to our customers, who primarily consist of hospitals and surgery centers, OB/GYN medical offices and fertility clinics, will depend on the availability of payor coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement, for the procedures using our products, by government insurance programs and other third-party payors. Payor coverage and reimbursement for procedures using medical devices in the United States and international markets vary significantly by country. With respect to drug coverage and reimbursement, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of drugs, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We believe the overall escalating cost of medical products and services being paid for by the government and private health insurance has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare and medical device industry to reduce the costs of products and services. 
 
 Healthcare Reform 
 
 In the United States and foreign countries, there has been, and continues to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates. We expect that additional state, federal and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that state, federal and foreign governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures. 
 
 Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. Passed in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical, medical device and clinical laboratory industries. Additionally, there has recently been heightened scrutiny by governmental authorities, individual hospitals, and third-party payors over product prices, which has resulted in proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Most recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). 
 
 In the EU, regulations have been adopted which are intended to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including certain high-risk medical devices, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. 
 
 Other Laws and Regulations 
 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws, including provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, laws applicable to our facilities, products or manufacturing processes, including evolving regulations regarding the use of hazardous substances or chemicals in our products, and laws related to the protection of the environment, environmental health and safety regulations, Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) in electrical and electronic equipment in the EU, and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances (REACH). 
 
 We are subject to various other federal, state and foreign laws related to the manufacturing and distribution of our products and to our international operations, including export control and trade compliance laws.

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

RAW MATERIALS 
 
 Our businesses utilize various chemicals, packaging materials, components, parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source. However, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens, certain medical devices and IVF products. Supply of these materials is protected by contractual agreements and safety stocks. However, if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis, or at all for any reason, we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in the supply of products if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice. 
 
 MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 
 
 CooperVision markets our products through our own field sales representatives, distributors and eye care practitioners, including optometrists, ophthalmologists, opticians and optical chains. CooperVision also sells to distributors and to mass merchandisers who offer eye care services. To support the sale and use of CooperVision products, CooperVision engages in various activities and offers a variety of services. These include clinical training, digital marketing for the customer, e-commerce, telemarketing, social media, and journal advertisements. In certain smaller countries, CooperVision often uses distributors and leverages our distributors' sales and marketing resources to attract major customers to CooperVision. With the addition of MiSight, CooperVision has expanded the breadth and depth of its sales capabilities by adding myopia management specialists while expanding awareness campaigns to include direct-to-consumer elements including print, internet/social media, radio and television. 
 
 CooperSurgical's products are marketed by a network of dedicated field sales representatives, independent agents and distributors. CooperSurgical augments its sales and marketing activities by participating in national and regional industry trade shows, professional educational programs and internet promotions including e-commerce, search and social media and collaborative efforts with professional organizations, telemarketing, direct mail and advertising in professional journals. Since the addition of donor gametes, Paragard and cord blood and cord tissue storage services, CooperSurgical has also expanded its awareness campaigns to include direct-to-consumer elements including print, internet/social media and radio. 
 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 
 We protect our products through patents and trademark registrations, both in the United States and in international markets. We monitor competitive products trademark use worldwide and, when determined appropriate, we have enforced and plan to continue to enforce and defend our patent and trademark rights. We also rely upon trade secrets, licenses, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.

Trade names, trademarks and service marks of the other companies appearing in this report are the property of their respective holders. 
 
 DEPENDENCE ON CUSTOMERS 
 
 No customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2024 and 2023. See Note 12. Business Segment Information of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 SEASONALITY 
 
 CooperVision and CooperSurgical net sales in the fiscal first quarter, which runs from November 1 through January 31, are typically lower than subsequent quarters, as patient traffic to practitioners' offices, fertility clinics, and hospitals/surgery centers for surgical procedures is less during the holiday season.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Our business faces significant risks. These risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Business 
 
 Current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business. 
 
 Over the last few years in the United States and globally, market and economic conditions have been challenging. The United States and foreign countries have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues. Any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets, continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets, inflation, deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. It may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Ongoing uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other business partners. When our customers financial conditions are adversely affected, customers may reduce their purchases of our products or we may not be able to collect accounts receivable, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our global business has been negatively affected by local economic conditions, including inflation, increasing labor costs, recession, and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which has adversely affected our cost to manufacture and provide our products and services and revenues generated through sales of such products and services. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to fully absorb any such additional costs or revenue declines in the prices for our products and services. 
 
 CooperVision and CooperSurgical are encountering consolidation in their customer bases and emergence of more centralized large customer groups and retail chains. Due to this trend, global and regional key account customers now represent a larger proportion or concentration of our business and any disruption to these relationships may have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 
 Inflation could materially adversely affect our business. 
 
 Our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in the overall macroeconomic environment and other economic factors that impact our cost structure and revenue. Changes in economic conditions, supply chain constraints, logistics challenges, labor shortages, international conflicts, and steps taken by governments and central banks, as well as other stimulus and spending programs, have led to higher inflation, which is likely to lead to an increase in costs and may cause changes in fiscal and monetary policy, including increased interest rates. In a higher inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products and services sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation. 
 
 Our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our business. 
 
 A significant portion of our current operations are conducted and located outside the United States, and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions. We have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in North America, Latin America and Europe. More than half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2024, and 2023, were derived from the sale of products outside the United States. We believe that sales outside the United States will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future. International operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks, including the following: 
 
 difficulty managing a large organization spread throughout various countries; 
 fluctuations in currency exchange rates adversely affecting our results; 
 challenges associated with enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries; 
 difficulty gaining market share in countries such as China because of regulatory restrictions and customer preferences; 
 19 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

difficulty growing our sales in emerging markets such as China, India, Russia, Brazil and other developing nations due to, among other things, customer acceptance, undeveloped and/or unfamiliar distribution channels, regulatory restrictions and changes, and business knowledge of these new markets; 
 foreign earnings being subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions, including the tariffs enacted by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods, the scope and duration of which remain uncertain; 
 challenges in complying with a variety of international legal, compliance and regulatory requirements such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the UK Bribery Act, international data security and privacy laws, EU MDR and EU IVDR and environmental laws and requirements applicable to our facilities, products or manufacturing processes, including evolving regulations regarding the use of hazardous substances or chemicals in our products; 
 the need to engage third-party agents or intermediaries to act on our behalf in certain countries, including in those countries with a high risk of corruption; 
 foreign customers creating longer payment cycles than customers in the United States; 
 failure to comply with U.S. Department of Commerce and other nations' import-export controls may result in fines and/or penalties; 
 general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate having an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or being unfavorable to our growth strategy; 
 international conflicts, acts or threats of war or terrorism may lead to significant market and other disruptions, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, trade disputes or trade barriers, embargoes, changes in consumer or purchase preferences, as well as an increase in cyberattacks and espionage; 
 challenges in complying with new and evolving international economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations; 
 natural disasters, pandemics and labor disruptions, the duration and severity of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict; 
 foreign governments adopting regulations, including those similar to the EU MDR and EU IVDR or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities, including but not limited to increased enforcement of potentially conflicting and ambiguous anti-bribery and privacy laws; 
 challenges enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; and 
 unforeseen economic or political events in certain countries that may have an impact on our customers' ability or preferences to buy our products. 
 
 As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. However, any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our business. 
 
 Economic and trade sanctions could make it more difficult or costly for us to conduct our operations or achieve our business objectives. 
 
 Our business must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security Council, and other relevant governmental authorities. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit altogether the sale or supply of certain of our products to certain governments, persons, entities, countries, and territories, including those that are the target of comprehensive sanctions, unless there are license exceptions that apply or specific licenses are obtained. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines and the denial of export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Acquisitions and other strategic transactions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks. 
 
 We have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years. As part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses and establishing joint ventures or other strategic relationships. Future transactions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization and/or impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business. Risks we could face with respect to these acquisitions and other strategic transaction include: 
 
 failure to successfully obtain the anticipated revenues, margins and earnings benefits; 
 difficulties in, and expenses related to, the integration of the operations, technologies, information technology and other enterprise resource planning systems, products and personnel of the acquired company and establishment of appropriate accounting controls and reporting procedures, data protection systems and other regulatory compliance procedures, including but not limited to third-party compliance and due diligence; 
 20 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

increased leverage and the risk of lack of access to available financing, including financing for the acquisition or refinancing of debt owed by us on a timely basis and on reasonable terms; 
 risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; 
 potential loss of employees; 
 an inability to identify and consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; 
 diversion of management's attention away from other business concerns; 
 risks of the acquired company s noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations; 
 expenses of any undisclosed or potential liabilities, contingent liabilities or indemnification obligations of the acquired company; 
 expenses, including restructuring expenses, to shut down our own locations or terminate our employees; 
 application of and compliance with new and unfamiliar regulatory frameworks; 
 failure to successfully obtain or maintain reimbursements under the third-party payor plans, including but not limited to governmental programs, due to complex reporting and payment obligations; 
 our ability to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in joint ventures or other affiliations; 
 a dilution of earnings per share; and 
 risks inherent in accounting allocations and the risk that we are required to record significant adjustments to the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the measurement period. 
 
 We face risks associated with disruption of our manufacturing, distribution and storage operations, including possible failure to develop necessary manufacturing processes, or constrained, idle or excess capacity, which could adversely affect our business. 
 
 We manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities or our fertility and stem cell storage facilities, whether due to work stoppages, technical or labor difficulties, integration difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disaster, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events), enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory body if we are found to be in non-compliance with current cGMP or similar foreign requirements or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost-effective. While we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products, our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete. Conversely, constrained, excess or idle capacity, which could result from acquisitions, unexpected demand, inaccurate sales forecasting or unexpected manufacturing efficiencies, could significantly impact our profitability, capital investments, customer service levels and near-term financial condition. 
 
 CooperVision manufactures molded contact lenses, which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues, primarily at our facilities in Costa Rica, Hungary, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and the United States, with other smaller facilities also existing in multiple locations around the world. CooperSurgical manufactures the majority of its products in Costa Rica, the United Kingdom and the United States, with other smaller locations also existing in multiple locations around the world. We manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets, and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site. Further, certain media products have limited storage lives, limiting inventory back-up strategies. If there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility, it could take a significant amount of time to obtain required regulatory approvals, validate a second site and replace lost product, which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales, profitability and market share. 
 
 CooperVision distributes products out of Belgium, Hungary, the United Kingdom and the United States and various smaller international distribution sites. CooperSurgical primarily distributes products out of its facilities in the United States and the Netherlands and operates fertility and stem cell storage facilities in the United States, Canada and Australia. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution or storage facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, challenges related to system implementation, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disaster, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events) or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication; a successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems, or those of our third-party service providers, or cause the 
 21 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business, force us to incur excessive costs or cause reputational harm. 
 
 Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent across industries and may occur on our systems or those of our third-party service providers or partners. The size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, levels of sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, especially given increased vulnerability of corporate information technology systems as distributed work environments have become prevalent. In addition to unauthorized access to or acquisition of personal data, confidential information, intellectual property or other sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and ransomware, and may use a variety of methods, including denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means, to attain such unauthorized access or acquisition or otherwise affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Like many other companies, we experience attempted cybersecurity actions on a frequent basis, and the frequency of such attempts could increase in the future. While we have implemented procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and invested in the protection of data and information technology, we cannot be assured that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches. The techniques used by cybercriminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments or agencies. We cannot be assured that our data protection efforts and our investment in information technology will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages or breaches in our systems or those of our third-party services providers or partners. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information, including protected health information (PHI), or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems, and we cannot guarantee that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all. 
 
 We manage our businesses utilizing multiple complex integrated software and hardware information technology operating systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded; an interruption or disruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to incur excessive costs. 
 
 We utilize multiple complex integrated software and hardware operating systems, including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems, to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth. Regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected. We employ controlled change management methodologies to plan, test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements, and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation. However, we cannot be assured that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed. We cannot be assured that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance, support and/or upgrade of these systems. 
 
 We are in the midst of a multiyear process of implementing new enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems at CooperVision and CooperSurgical. Implementing a new ERP system is not only costly but complex and difficult. Implementing a new ERP system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery. We cannot be assured that we will successfully implement our new ERP system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts. 
 
 If any of such systems or programs were to experience service interruptions, fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, inability to track sales and interruption of other operational or financial processes, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. 
 
 We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to an ineffective information technology (IT) general control for the U.S. operations within the CooperSurgical segment which, if not remediated appropriately or timely, could affect our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and prepare financial statements within required time periods and could subject us to litigation or investigations, negatively affect investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price. 
 
 22 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Internal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, during fiscal 2024, management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of October 31, 2024 due to a material weakness in IT general controls for the CooperSurgical operations in the U.S. primarily related to the implementation and maintenance of certain enterprise resource planning systems during fiscal 2024. The material weakness resulted from not having a sufficient complement of its personnel, inadequate training of personnel and ineffective assessment of the risks related to change management, user control monitoring and segregation of duties in the affected IT environment. Manual controls that rely on system-generated data or reports from the affected IT environment or process level automated controls in the affected IT environment were ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. In response to the material weakness, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, has begun to implement steps to remediate the material weakness. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject us to reputational harm, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, significant costs from remedial actions, additional management resources, and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statement and adversely impact our stock price. 
 
 Pricing pressure from our competitors, customers and changes in third-party coverage and reimbursement may adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our operating results. 
 
 Competition in our industry has increased as a result of new market entrants, new technologies and as more established companies have intensified competitive pricing pressure. As a result of these competitive forces, we believe there will continue to be pricing pressure in the future. Because our CooperSurgical products are generally purchased by hospitals and surgery centers, OB/GYN medical offices and fertility clinics, and billed to various third-party payors, changes in the purchasing behavior of such customers or the amount such payors are willing to reimburse our customers for procedures using our products, including as a result of healthcare reform initiatives, could create additional pricing pressure on us. In addition to these competitive forces, we continue to see pricing pressure as our customers introduce new pricing structures into their contracts and agreements, including fixed price formulas, capitated pricing and structured pricing intended to contain healthcare costs. Such trends may adversely affect demand for our products and may drive down the prices we are able to charge for our products, both of which would negatively affect our operating results. 
 
 We rely on independent suppliers in our supply chain for raw materials, packaging materials and components, mechanical equipment and some finished goods; we could experience inventory shortages if any of these suppliers encounter a manufacturing or distribution disruption. 
 
 Our businesses utilize various chemicals, packaging materials, components, parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source. However, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole or primary suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens, certain medical devices and IVF products. We also source mechanical equipment and in certain instances finished goods from OEM suppliers. Supply of these goods, items and materials is protected by contractual agreements, availability of alternative suppliers and/or safety stocks. However, if current suppliers fail to supply sufficient goods, items or materials to us on a timely basis, or at all for any reason, we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in our supply of products. For example, among other situations, some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products, including MyDay, Biofinity, Avaira and clariti, are supplied by few or sole suppliers, and the failure of a key or sole supplier to timely supply sufficient items and materials necessary for the manufacture of our silicone hydrogel contact lenses could in turn disrupt our supply of those lenses to the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Our supply chain and our cost of goods also may be negatively impacted by unanticipated price increases due to factors such as inflation, including wage inflation, or to supply restrictions beyond our control or the control of our suppliers. 
 
 If we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, our business could suffer. 
 
 We consider our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks and licensing agreements, to be an integral component of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation. Our claims, even if meritorious, may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights. In addition, litigation can: 
 
 be expensive and time consuming to prosecute or defend; 
 23 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

result in a finding that we do not have certain intellectual property rights or that such rights lack sufficient scope or strength; 
 divert management's attention and resources; or 
 require us to license our intellectual property. 
 
 We have applied for patent protection in the United States, the United Kingdom and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products. We cannot be assured that any of our patent applications will be approved. Patent applications in the United States, the United Kingdom and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time, which may last until patents are issued, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months, we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions. The patents we own could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. We also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents. 
 
 Both CooperVision and CooperSurgical also rely on proprietary technology that is unpatented. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements, which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, we cannot be assured that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult, expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. 
 
 We rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products. To maintain the value of our trademarks, we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks. We also might not be successful in obtaining registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications against challenge by third parties. Enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages, including the inability to continue using certain trademarks. 
 
 The laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others. 
 
 Our competitors in both the United States and foreign countries, some of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, as well as other third parties, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products. In the contact lens industry, CooperVision, its competitors and other third parties hold patents covering contact lens designs, materials, processes and business methods. Claims that our products, business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology. 
 
 Significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries. For example, CooperVision in the past faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products. Third parties have made, and may make in the future, claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology. Any claims, even those without merit, could: 
 
 be expensive and time consuming to defend; 
 cause us to cease making, licensing or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 
 require us to redesign or re-engineer our products, if feasible; 
 divert management's attention and resources; or 
 require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a necessary product, component or process. 
 24 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

We cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation. A successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology, in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market, could adversely affect our business. Any royalty or licensing agreement, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of some of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We could experience losses from product liability claims or legal claims relating to our service offerings, including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products. 
 
 We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury. We also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers, distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand. Additionally, we face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims, including negligence, relating to our provision of certain service offerings, including the accuracy and quality of our genomic services, fertility cryopreservation, fertility donor gamete supply, and stem cell storage services. These risks may be heightened due to our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts for some of our products and services (e.g., stem cell storage and Paragard IUDs). Consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product or service that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited. We handle some risk with third-party carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations. These insurance policies may become more expensive (or not be available) for new risks we may assume when we acquire new businesses. We cannot be assured that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls, legal claims relating to our service offerings, or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products, in the future. 
 
 If our products or services are not accepted by the market, we will not be able to sustain or expand our business. 
 
 Certain of our proposed products or services have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced, and some of our existing products or services are marketed and sold on the basis of potential future medical or therapeutic value (assuming technology advances), and we cannot be sure that any of them will achieve market acceptance or generate revenues or operating profits. The development of a market for our products or services may be influenced by many factors, some of which are out of our control, including: 
 
 acceptance of our products or services by eye care or other health care practitioners; 
 the cost competitiveness of our products and services; 
 consumer reluctance to try and use a new product or service; 
 regulatory and legislative requirements; 
 adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors; 
 lack of scientific advancements to validate the medical value of certain products or services, such as stored cord blood or cord tissue (or scientific advancements in other medical approaches that reduce or eliminate the value of such products or services); and 
 the earlier release of competitive products or services, such as new silicone hydrogel products or contraceptive technologies, into the market by our competitors; and the emergence of newer and more competitive products or services. 
 
 We operate in the highly competitive health care industry, and we cannot be assured that we will be able to compete successfully. 
 
 Each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment. In our soft contact lens business, CooperVision faces intense competition from competitors' products, in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses, and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market. Our largest competitors in the contact lens business, Johnson Johnson Vision Care, Inc., Alcon Inc. and Bausch Health Companies Inc. may have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development budgets, larger sales forces, greater market penetration and/or larger manufacturing volumes than CooperVision. They offer competitive products and differentiated materials, plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses. The market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel-based products. Our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully, on a timely basis in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, 
 25 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products. Any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend, in part, on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities and our ability to secure adequate supply of materials used in production at reasonable costs. Our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 To a lesser extent, CooperVision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery. 
 
 We cannot be assured that we will not encounter increased competition in the future, for example with increased product entries from Asia Pacific contact lens manufacturers, or that our competitors' newer contact lens products will not successfully erode CooperVision's contact lens business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 The contact lens industry also continues to evolve with respect to the introduction of new distribution and fulfillment models and service technologies which may conflict with CooperVision s strategy or interfere with its customers relationships and loyalty. For example, more contact lenses are being fulfilled directly to the consumer by manufacturers and wholesalers via online platforms, telemedicine is gaining popularity and more vision correction prescriptions are being provided through online refractive exams rather than in office by an eye care practitioner. CooperVision s failure to adapt to the threats posed by these new and emerging distribution models and Internet driven services may have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 
 CooperSurgical focuses on selected segments of the family and women's health care market with a diversified portfolio of products and services including fertility products and services, medical devices, cryostorage (such as cord blood and cord tissue storage) and contraception. Competitive factors in these segments in which CooperSurgical competes include technological and scientific advances, product quality and availability, price, customer service including response time and effective communication of product information to physicians, consumers, fertility clinics and hospitals. Competition in the medical device industry is dynamic and involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations. 
 
 CooperSurgical competes with a number of manufacturers and service providers in its women s family health care market areas. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a broader range of products, which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products. In addition, some of CooperSurgical s markets, such as genomics, contraception and cord blood and cord tissue storage, are characterized by rapid technological advancement. We face the risk that demand for our products will not grow or will decline if our competitors are more successful than us at innovating in these and other areas. There is also risk that emerging technologies or technology advancements could reduce the medical value of certain of our products and services, such as cord blood and cord tissue storage, which could adversely affect our business. In recent years, CooperSurgical has also expanded direct-to-consumer products and services, which requires implementing new competitive strategies and increases the importance of customer service and consumer reputation as competitive factors. 
 
 New medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products. 
 
 Technological developments in the vision, fertility and women s health, may limit demand for our products and services. For example, corneal refractive surgical procedures such as Lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products. If these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction, the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease. We cannot be assured that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate, and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or certifications or if our competitors introduce new products. 
 
 Product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which CooperVision competes and in the areas of the health care industry in which CooperSurgical competes. CooperVision, both internally and externally with third parties, invests in new product development, including the development of new silicone hydrogel-based contact lenses. While much of CooperVision s research and development activities are performed internally, it also uses external research and development investment in collaborations and joint development with third parties. CooperSurgical has historically purchased, leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others. CooperSurgical also has invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of organic growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy. Research and development time commitments, higher feasibility risk with longer term projects, greater dependence on, and reduced control over, third-party deliverables, the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval or certification and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial. We cannot be assured that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals, certifications or clearances for our new products or that our new 
 26 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

products will successfully compete in the marketplace and, as a result, justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval or certification. In addition, our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies. Failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We face risks related to environmental, social and governance matters. 
 
 We and our facilities are subject to a broad range of U.S federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and requirements, including those governing discharges to the air and water, the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements. Future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or the enforcement thereof, or the discovery of contamination at our facilities, may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such laws and requirements are constantly changing, are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations. As a manufacturer of various products, we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters, and we cannot be assured that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims. 
 
 We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. These regulations include, for example, regulations enacted in the EU such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances, which requires the registration of and regulates use of certain chemicals, the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, which regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in certain products our CooperSurgical division manufactures. These and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China and various states of the United States may require us to re-design certain products to ensure compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 In addition, new disclosure standards and rules related to ESG matters have been adopted and may continue to be introduced in various states and other jurisdiction. For example, the European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) became effective in 2023 and applies to both EU and non-EU entities. In October 2023, California adopted new carbon and climate-related reporting requirements for large public and private companies doing business in the state. Further, the SEC adopted a final rule on the Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures in 2024. International ESG disclosure standards have also been produced (and further standards will be produced) under the auspices of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), which some countries (such as the UK) have indicated they may incorporate into ESG disclosure standards required of certain companies. As the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, significant effort and expenses could be required to comply with the evolving requirements. As our disclosure obligations increase, third parties may make claims or bring litigation relating to those disclosures which may be costly. 
 
 Environmental, social and corporate governance issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business and damage our reputation. 
 
 There is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, employees and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters. Additionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies ESG practices continue to grow. If our ESG practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or investor, customer, consumer, employee or other stakeholders' evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship, support for local communities, Board of Director and employee diversity, human capital management, employee health and safety practices, product quality, supply chain management, corporate governance and transparency, our reputation, brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to do business with us. 
 
 Customers, consumers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, energy and water use, plastic waste and other sustainability concerns. Concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials, in particular, may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment. Changing customer and consumer preferences or increased regulatory requirements may result in increased demands or requirements regarding plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-recyclable plastic products and packaging, other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability, or increased customer and consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of substances present in certain of our products. Complying with these demands or requirements could cause us to incur additional manufacturing, operating or product development costs.

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

If we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations, or fail to meet evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and concerns regarding ESG issues, investors may reconsider their capital investment in our Company, and customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. 
 
 If we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business could suffer. 
 
 If we fail to recruit, develop and retain the necessary personnel, our business and our ability to obtain new customers, develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer. The success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, develop and retain and motivate highly skilled sales, marketing, manufacturing engineering and scientific personnel. Competition for these persons in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel. We are experiencing increasing challenges in building and retaining our workforce in certain markets, where pressure from inflation and competition have exacerbated turnover and retention trends. Labor shortages and competition for qualified personnel could cause disruptions in our business operations. 
 
 Provisions of our governing documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects. 
 
 Certain provisions of our Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws may inhibit changes in control of the Company not approved by our Board of Directors. These provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations. We also have the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have anti-takeover effects. 
 
 Risks Relating to Government Regulation of Manufacture and Sale of Our Products and Services. 
 
 Legislative or regulatory reforms in the United States, Europe or other countries may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances, approvals or certifications for our products or to manufacture, market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained. 
 
 From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of drugs and medical devices. In addition, the FDA may change its premarket clearance and approval policies for drugs and medical devices, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. For example, over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. 
 
 In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain clearance or approval for, manufacture, market or distribute our products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval; changes to manufacturing methods; recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products; or additional record keeping. 
 
 In addition to traditional regulatory controls on drugs and medical devices, our business could be affected by emerging laws or regulations limiting our ability to offer certain of our products and services. For example, in the United States, the reversal by the U.S. Supreme Court of Roe v. Wade has raised concerns in the fertility industry that more restrictive laws could limit access to various reproductive services. New and emerging laws may be interpreted to limit access to contraceptive technologies or cryostorage services, which could adversely affect certain aspects of CooperSurgical s business. 
 
 In addition, the EU landscape concerning medical devices (including IVDs) has recently evolved and may be subject to further developments in 2025. A new set of two EU regulations have been adopted on April 5, 2017. On May 26, 2021, the EU MDR became applicable and replaced previous directives and established transitional provisions. The EU IVDR became applicable on May 26, 2022. However, the European institutions adopted subsequent regulations amending the EU IVDR for a gradual roll-out of the EU IVDR to prevent disruptions in the supply of IVDs. The EU IVDR fully applies since May 26, 2022, but there is a tiered system extending the grace period for many devices (depending on their risk classification) before they have to be fully compliant with the regulation. Both regulations have been adopted to establish a 
 28 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices (including IVDs) and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. 
 
 These modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to develop our business in the EU and EEA. For example, as a result of the transition towards the new regimes, notified body review times have lengthened, and product introductions could be delayed or canceled. Additionally, only a few notified bodies have been designated for EU IVDR certification, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. 
 
 Following the end of the Brexit transitional period, from January 1, 2021, the MHRA became the UK s independent regulatory agency for medical devices. Post-Brexit, amendments have been made to the existing UK medical devices legislation which require medical devices to be registered with the MHRA before being placed on the Great Britain market. Manufacturers based outside of the UK need to appoint a UK Responsible Person to register devices with the MHRA. On January 9, 2024, the MHRA published a roadmap setting out its plans and timelines for towards the reform of the regulatory framework for medical devices in the UK. Regulations implementing core elements of the new framework are intended to be in place by 2025. Pending such reform of the UK regulatory framework, the government has confirmed that general medical devices compliant with the EU MDD with a valid declaration and CE marking can be placed on the Great Britain market up until the sooner of expiry of certificate or June 30, 2028. Medical devices, including custom-made devices, compliant with the EU MDR can be placed on the Great Britain market up until June 30, 2030. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, differ from those in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and continue to be based on EU law. These developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and our business may be impacted and the demand for our products could be depressed. 
 
 Our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls, even after receiving regulatory clearance, approval or certification, which could harm our reputation and business. 
 
 After a drug or device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including the FDA's cGMP and QSR regulations, which require manufacturers to follow, among other things, design, testing, production, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations; and adverse event reporting regulations that require us to report to FDA or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers, such as CooperVision and CooperSurgical, may, under their own initiative, recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a product is found, or withdraw a product for other reasons. The FDA requires that certain medical device corrections or removals, including recalls, be reported to the FDA within ten working days of initiating the correction or removal. Recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products. In addition, the FDA or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results. 
 
 If our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations, our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted, our products could be subject to recall, and sales and profitability could suffer. 
 
 Our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal, state and foreign regulatory requirements, including the FDA's cGMP regulations for drugs and QSR for medical devices, which govern the procedures related to the design, testing, production processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage, importing, exporting and shipping of our products. We also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of drugs and medical devices. In addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies (as well as audits by notified bodies) in other countries. Failure to comply with cGMP, QSR and other applicable domestic or international regulatory requirements or to respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to, among other things, warning letters, significant fines, injunctions, suspension of approvals, seizures, recalls or import holds of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. As a result, any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability. 
 
 On January 31, 2024, the FDA issued a final rule to amend the QSR regulations to align more closely with the International Organization for Standardization standards. Accordingly, this could impose additional or different regulatory 
 29 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

requirements on CooperVision and CooperSurgical that could increase the costs of compliance or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business. 
 
 The manufacture of drug-device combination products, such as Paragard, is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment. We and our contract manufacturers must comply with applicable cGMP, QSR and similar foreign regulations and guidelines. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical therapeutics often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if microbial, viral or other contamination are discovered in our drug products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our drug products are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot be assured that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of any of our drug products will not occur in the future. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to continue marketing our drug products would be jeopardized. 
 
 Any adverse developments affecting manufacturing of our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Accordingly, failures or difficulties faced at any level of our supply chain could materially adversely affect our business and delay or impede the commercialization and marketing of any of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance, approval or certification for our products or operations could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA, and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. In the United States, the FDA regulates virtually all aspects of medical device and pharmaceutical design, development, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling (including, for example, unique device identifier regulations), storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, promotion, advertising and distribution, as well as product import and export. Our failure to comply with FDA regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions, including injunctions, fines, warning letters, suspensions or the loss of regulatory clearances or approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution or product seizures. In the most egregious cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible. 
 
 Our medical devices and pharmaceutical products require clearance or approval by the FDA before they can be commercially distributed in the United States and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions. Medical devices and drug products may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared. The process of obtaining, renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market product, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time consuming. We cannot be assured that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, and significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur, which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations. In addition, the FDA and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products, increase the cost of compliance, impose additional regulatory requirements on us, or otherwise impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products. 
 
 Modifications and enhancements to medical devices require a new FDA clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture. The FDA requires every medical device manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer's decision. We have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or approval, but we cannot confirm that the FDA will agree with our decisions. If the FDA requires us to seek clearance or approval for a modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position. We also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications, if required. 
 
 Our efforts to promote some of our products and services via direct-to-consumer marketing initiatives may subject us to additional scrutiny by the FDA, FTC or other agencies. For example, we promote PARAGARD and cord blood and cord tissue storage directly to end consumers. Regulatory agencies may further scrutinize our practices with respect to effective communication of risk information, benefits or claims with respect to such products. 
 30 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our products and product candidates. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our Company and our operating results may be adversely affected. 
 
 The FDA s and other regulatory authorities policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business. We also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. 
 
 Subject to transitional provisions and in order to sell our products in the EU, our products must respectively comply with general safety and performance requirements of the EU MDR and the EU IVDR. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the European Conformity (CE) mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EU. All medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the general safety and performance requirements laid down in the Annexes to the EU MDR and EU IVDR including that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and, where applicable, other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I) or general IVDs (Class A), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility, metrology or reuse aspects of a medical device), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product s technical dossiers and the manufacturer s quality system (notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards ISO 13485:2016 for Quality Management Systems conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the general safety and performance requirements, the notified body issues a CE certificate, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. If we fail to remain in compliance with applicable EU laws, directives or regulations, we would be unable to continue to affix the CE mark to our products, which would prevent us from selling them within the EU and EEA. 
 
 In the EU, regulatory authorities have the power to carry out announced and, if necessary, unannounced inspections of companies, as well as suppliers and/or sub-contractors and, where necessary, the facilities of professional users. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements (as applicable) could require time and resources to respond to the regulatory authorities observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions, as appropriate. Regulatory authorities have broad compliance and enforcement powers and if such issues cannot be resolved to their satisfaction can take a variety of actions, including untitled or warning letters, fines, consent decrees, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 
 The EU regulatory landscape concerning medical devices (including IVDs) is continuously evolving and the new requirements may have a significant effect on the way we conduct our business in the EU and the EEA. Following Brexit, the UK regulatory landscape concerning medical devices (including IVDs) is evolving and may have a significant effect on the way we conduct our business in the UK. See Risk Factors Legislative or regulatory reforms in the United States or Europe may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances, approvals or certifications for our products or to manufacture, market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained . 
 
 Development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to receive, or delay in receiving, foreign qualifications or certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 In many of the foreign countries in which we market our products, we are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets (for example, the French anti-gift legislation), duties and tax requirements. Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the FDA. 
 
 31 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in the EU legislation. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements be evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals. 
 
 In many countries, the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility. To date, we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations. However, our failure to receive, or delays in the receipt of, relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals or certifications and potential impact on demand for our genetic testing services. 
 
 In the United States, in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) are a type of medical device that can be used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases or other conditions. The FDA considers laboratory developed tests (LDTs) to be a subset of IVDs that are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. Similar tests are also known as In-House Tests (IH-Tests) in the EU and LDTs have historically been subject to enforcement discretion by the FDA and were not previously regulated under the 98/79EC in-vitro diagnostic directive (IVDD) of the EU. On May 6, 2024, the FDA published a final rule on the regulation LDTs, making explicit that LDTs are medical devices under the FDCA. In addition, the FDA is finalizing a policy under which the FDA will provide greater oversight of IVDs offered as LDTs through a phaseout of its general enforcement discretion approach over the course of four years, as well as targeted enforcement discretion policies for certain categories of IVDs manufactured by laboratories. 
 
 We offer certain genetic testing services to help identify the likelihood of pregnancy as well as identify possible disorders or diseases of a child prior to birth, and we have historically marketed these tests as LDTs in the United States. As a result, our tests may now be subject to the FDA s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable FDCA provisions, subject to the four year phase-out of enforcement discretion beginning in May of 2025. Compliance with the new requirements may require additional analytical or clinical studies or other actions in order to continue marketing our tests during the phase-out period, which could increase costs and expenses or otherwise negatively affect our business. The FDA LDT regulation is currently subject to legislative challenges which may result in less stringent requirements or a decrease in FDA enforcement of LDT requirements. Therefore, the costs to comply with the FDA LDT regulation and its impact on our business is difficult to predict. 
 
 Similarly, in the EU, the regulatory landscape has evolved to include the definition of an IH-Test as is an IVD that is developed and produced by a laboratory on a non-industrial scale and is provided to health institutions in accordance with Article 5 of the EU IVDR. Under such circumstances, many IH-Tests may continue to be exempt from regulation indefinitely or until 2030 in circumstances where commercially available CE marked options exist. Our genetic tests may be subject to the full application of the EU IVDR with respect to some or all of our existing, as well as future, tests if our tests do not qualify for an IH-Test exemption. We may be required to expend additional time and resources to comply with the requirements of the EU IVDR, resulting in additional expenses for offering our current and any future tests as well as possibly delaying or suspending development or commercialization of such tests. 
 
 We expect that new proposals or legislative changes may be introduced from time to time both in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Any new FDA enforcement policies affecting LDTs or regulations such as the EU IVDR is likely to result in increased regulatory burden on our ability to continue marketing our genetic products and to develop and introduce new products in the future, which could adversely affect our business. 
 
 If we fail to comply with applicable federal, state, local and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our genetic tests or experience disruptions to our business. 
 
 We are subject to the CLIA, a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. Our clinical laboratories must be certified under CLIA and ISO 15189 in order for us to perform testing on human specimens. In addition, our proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of our accredited programs under CLIA so that we can offer them in our laboratory. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. The law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state. In addition, we are subject to the UK Human Fertilization 
 32 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Embryology Association (HFEA) regulating IVF. Our laboratories are located in Japan, the United Kingdom and United States, and we must maintain the requisite licenses in each jurisdiction. 
 
 Any sanction imposed under CLIA, its implementing regulations, or state or foreign laws or regulations governing licensure, or our failure to renew a CLIA certificate, or a state or foreign license or accreditation, could have a material and adverse effect on our diagnostic testing business, operating results and financial condition. Three federal agencies are responsible for administering the CLIA program in the United States: the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the FDA. The CMS in particular has the authority to impose a wide range of sanctions, including revocation of CLIA certification along with a bar on the ownership or operation of a CLIA-certified laboratory by any owners or operators of the deficient laboratory. If we were to lose our CLIA certification or required state or foreign licensure, we would not be able to operate our clinical laboratory and conduct our tests, worldwide or in particular jurisdictions, which would adversely impact our diagnostic testing business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 Our HCT/P products are subject to extensive government regulation and our failure to comply with these requirements could cause our business to suffer. 
 
 In the United States, we provide donor egg and sperm for fertility treatments, in addition to fertility cryopreservation services and newborn stem cell storage (cord blood and cord tissue). Donated reproductive tissues, including eggs and sperm, as well as cord blood and cord tissue, are regulated to by the FDA as HCT/Ps. In the United States, we are marketing these HCT/Ps pursuant to Section 361 of the PHSA and 21 C.F.R. Part 1271 of FDA s regulations. Products subject to regulation as 361 HCT/Ps are not currently required to obtain marketing authorizations, so long as they meet certain criteria set forth in FDA regulations. However, HCT/Ps regulated as 361 HCT/Ps are currently subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, as well as stringent requirements relating to processing, storing, labeling and distributing HCT/Ps, including, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, providing required labeling information, record keeping and adverse event reporting. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to FDA allegations of noncompliance or enforcement action, including, for example, warning letters, fines, injunctions, product recalls or seizures, and, in the most serious cases, criminal penalties. To be regulated as 361 HCT/Ps, these products must meet the FDA s criteria to be considered minimally manipulated and intended for homologous use, among other requirements. HCT/Ps that do not meet the criteria to be considered 361 HCT/Ps are subject to the FDA s regulatory requirements applicable to medical devices, biologics or drugs, including, importantly, the requirement for premarket review and approval or clearance prior to marketing. 
 
 We believe our HCT/Ps are regulated solely under Section 361 of the PHSA, and therefore, we have not sought or obtained 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, or licensure through a Biologics License Application (BLA) for such HCT/Ps. However, the FDA could disagree with our determination that these human tissue products are 361 HCT/Ps and could determine that these products are biologics requiring a BLA or medical devices requiring 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, and could require that we cease marketing such products and/or recall them pending appropriate clearance, approval or licensure from the FDA, which would adversely affect our business. 
 
 In addition, the FDA may in the future modify the scope of its enforcement discretion with respect to 361 HCT/Ps or change its position on which current or future products qualify as 361 HCT/Ps, or determine that some or all of our HCT/P products may not be lawfully marketed without a marketing authorization. Any regulatory changes could have adverse consequences for us and make it more difficult or expensive for us to conduct our business by requiring pre-market clearance or approval and compliance with additional post-market regulatory requirements with respect to those products. 
 
 Disruptions at the FDA and other government agencies or notified bodies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, cleared or approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business. 
 
 The ability of the FDA, foreign agencies and notified bodies to review and clear, approve or certify new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA s, foreign agencies and notified bodies ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA s, foreign agencies and notified bodies ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the FDA, foreign agencies and notified bodies have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA, foreign agencies and notified bodies and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs and medical devices or modifications to cleared or approved drugs and medical devices to be reviewed, approved and/or certified by necessary government agencies or notified bodies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the United 
 33 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

States government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. 
 
 In the EU, notified bodies must be officially designated to certify products and services in accordance with the EU MDR and EU IVDR. Their designation process, which is significantly stricter under the new Regulations, has experienced considerable delays. Despite a recent increase in designations, the current number of notified bodies designated under the new Regulations remains significantly lower than the number of notified bodies designated under the previous regimes. The current designated notified bodies are, therefore, facing a backlog of requests, and review times have lengthened. This situation may impact the ability of our notified body to timely review and process our regulatory submissions and perform its audits. 
 
 Ethical, legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information, sperm and egg selection services and stem cells could reduce demand for our service offerings. 
 
 Genetic testing, sperm and egg selection services and the use of stem cells have raised ethical, legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of information related to these services. Government authorities could, for social or other purposes, limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. They also could limit, regulate or prohibit (1) sperm and egg selection services or (2) the use of stem cells. Ethical, legal or social concerns may lead patients to refuse to use, or physicians to be reluctant to order or recommend, genetic tests, sperm and egg selection services and stem cell storage services even if permissible. These and other ethical, legal and social concerns may limit market acceptance and adoption of our service offerings or reduce the potential markets for our service offerings, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The costs of complying with the requirements of federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information, including health related information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business. 
 
 Numerous laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability and integrity of personally identifiable information (PII), including protected health information (PHI). We collect and process PII in multiple ways in our various business lines and are subject to risk associated with compliance with many of these laws and regulations. Some of our businesses expose us to increasingly stringent regulations for handling personal information (where, for example, we collect or process PII deemed to be sensitive by regulatory authorities, such as PHI). 
 
 Under U.S. law, HIPAA establishes national privacy and security standards for protection of PHI by covered entities and the business associates with whom such entities contract for services. HIPAA requires both covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures for PHI that is used or disclosed, and to adopt administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect PHI. Mandatory penalties for HIPAA violations can be significant. A single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. If a person knowingly or intentionally obtains or discloses PHI in violation of HIPAA requirements, criminal penalties may also be imposed. 
 
 We maintain technical, organizational and contractual safeguards that we believe are reasonable and appropriate to protect the privacy and security of PHI and other personally identifiable information consistent with applicable laws and our contractual obligations; however, we may not be able to prevent incidences of inappropriate use or unauthorized access to PHI by our employees, contractors or external factors, despite the safeguards. Any such breaches of our systems or those of our vendors, customers or other third parties could result in exposure to liability under federal and state laws and/or under our contractual arrangements and could adversely impact our business. 
 
 We are also subject to various other laws in the United States such as Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which requires a company s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities and the CCPA, which gives California residents certain rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that has increased the likelihood of, and risks associated with data breach litigation. Similar laws have been enacted in other states and proposed at the federal level, and such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that make compliance challenging. 
 
 We are also subject to laws and regulations in countries other than United States covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. EU and EEA member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the GDPR imposes stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data in the context of an establishment in the 
 34 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

EEA or the processing of personal data of individuals within the EEA and increases the scrutiny of transfer of personal data from the EEA. Following the UK's withdrawal from the EEA and the EU, and the expiry of the transition period, companies will have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into the UK national law (the UK GDPR). In addition, countries of the EEA may impose further obligations relating to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could further add to our compliance costs and limit how we process this information. Some of the personal data we process in respect of clinical trial participants is special category or sensitive personal data under the GDPR, and subject to additional compliance obligations and to local law derogations. We may be subject to diverging requirements under EU member state laws and UK law. We are also subject to China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which imposes requirements regarding processing PII, data localization and cross-border transfers of PII, as well as a number of other laws in the Asia Pacific area. As these laws develop, we may need to make operational changes to adapt to these diverging rules, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our business. 
 
 Compliance with U.S. and foreign privacy and security laws, rules and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, require us to engage in costly compliance exercises, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our or our partners or suppliers ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Each of these constantly evolving laws can be subject to varying interpretations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of PII may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by European Data Protection Supervisory Authorities, fines and penalties, litigation, orders to cease or change our data processing activities, enforcement notices, assessment notices for a compulsory audit and/or civil claims (including class actions), adverse publicity and reputational damage. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations or suffer a security breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 When we acquire companies or business that engage in personal data processing, we may become subject to additional regulation or scrutiny, particularly if such activity is different in nature from what we have done in the past. For example, with the recent addition of cord blood and cord tissue storage (and other cryostorage) businesses, we interact directly with our customers and collect and maintain personal information regarding our customers and donors. Acquisitions like this could subject us to additional regulatory and consumer liability risk and the cost of analyzing and integrating new privacy compliance programs. 
 
 Changes in legislation and government regulation of the health care industry both in the United States and internationally, as well as third-party payors' efforts to control the costs of health care could materially adversely affect our business. 
 
 The ACA made extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the United States. Among the provisions of the ACA, of greatest importance to the medical device industry and pharmaceutical industry are the following: 
 
 Establishment of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 
 Payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models; 
 Establishment of a Center for Medicare Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending; and 
 An increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1 and 13 of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively. 
 
 These measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our fertility, office and surgical portfolios and decrease potential returns from our development efforts. 
 
 Other legislative changes which impact the medical device and pharmaceutical industry have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which, among other things, replaced and changed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which eliminated the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap. 
 
 In foreign countries where we market our products, recent healthcare reform has taken place as well. For instance, in December 2021, the EU Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment (HTA) amending Directive 
 35 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

2011/24/EU was adopted. This Regulation intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including certain high-risk medical devices, and provide the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. It will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the highest potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technologies, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. 
 
 We expect that additional state, federal and foreign health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products, any of which could limit the amounts that federal state and foreign governments will pay for health care products and services, which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products, or result in additional pricing pressures. Also, any adoption of health care reform proposals on a state-by-state basis could require us to develop state-specific marketing and sales approaches. We cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business. 
 
 In addition, third-party payors, whether governmental or commercial, whether inside the United States or abroad, increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care. These cost-control methods include prospective payment systems, capitated rates, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, requiring pre-authorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures, encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering health care. Although cost controls or other requirements imposed by third-party payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices, this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business. 
 
 We may enroll as in-network providers and suppliers with certain payors. Although, becoming an in-network provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates, it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels. Thus, these payor relationships, or any similar relationships we may establish in the future, may not result in acceptable levels of reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base. We cannot predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payors will cover and reimburse for our tests. If we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests, our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited and our future prospects and our business could suffer. 
 
 Laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business. 
 
 We may be subject to various federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, physician self-referral false claims and physician payment transparency laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including our commercial laboratory operations and how we research, market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include: 
 
 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or certain rebates), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase, lease, or order, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
 
 the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, which generally prohibit entities from billing a patient or the Medicare or Medicaid programs for certain designated health services, including clinical laboratory services, when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician s immediate family, has a financial interest, such as an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. These prohibitions apply regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral; 
 
 the federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using or 
 36 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act; 
 
 the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which, among other things, authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments, and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to, offering remuneration to a federal healthcare program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive healthcare items or services from a particular provider; 
 
 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
 
 the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
 
 analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers and self-pay patients; some state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug and device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; some state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products; and some state and local laws that require the registration of sales representatives. 
 
 In addition, federal government price reporting laws, among other things, require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on our marketed drugs. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products, increased infrastructure costs and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts. 
 
 Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs and TRICARE. Similarly, if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of the complex and far-reaching nature of these laws, we cannot be assured that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. Any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Risks Relating to Interest and Foreign Exchange Rates, Debt and Equity 
 
 Exchange rate fluctuations and foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results. 
 
 As a result of our international operations, currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position. Our most significant currency exposures are the British pound, Euro and Japanese yen. We expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To the extent we are unable to materially offset non-functional currency flows, exchange rate fluctuations could 
 37 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies, the translation of those results into U.S. dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our stockholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a period-over-period comparative basis. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our non-functional currency obligations or balances, they would not eliminate that risk entirely. 
 
 We are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt. 
 
 We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt. In order to maintain a desired mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, from time to time we may use interest rate swap agreements to fix a portion of our variable-rate debt as further described in Note 13. Financial Derivatives and Hedging of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively, which could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations. 
 
 We have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness. 
 
 Our indebtedness could: 
 
 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes; 
 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; 
 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; 
 result in greater interest rate risk and volatility; 
 limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and 
 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including our obligation to repay our credit facilities under certain circumstances, or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all. 
 
 Our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt, which could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit plan costs. 
 
 We sponsor a defined benefit plan for certain employees in the United States. This defined benefit plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns, discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could increase our cash requirements and adversely affect our business. 
 
 Risks Relating to Taxes 
 
 Changes in tax laws, examinations by tax authorities, and changes in our geographic composition of income could adversely affect our financial results. 
 
 We are subject to U.S. and foreign tax laws that may change. The base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) includes Pillar Two, a global minimum tax rate of 15 that may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. 
 
 We are subject to the examination of our tax returns and other matters by tax authorities. Tax authorities could challenge our positions related to transfer pricing and intercompany transactions, including the valuation of intangible assets. Tax examinations can result in costly litigation with significant interest and penalties and ultimate settlement can take several 
 38 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

years. For example, we have engaged (and expect to continue to engage) with tax authorities over tax positions we have taken in connection with our acquisitions, and such examinations could cause us to incur significant expense (and adverse determinations by the tax authority could result in penalties) which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. 
 
 Our effective tax rate could fluctuate based on the geographic composition of income, which could significantly change based on our business results and acquisitions. Our effective tax rate could also fluctuate based on changes in estimates, changes in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, changes in non-deductible expenses, and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. These fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity. 
 
 Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy 
 
 We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information assets and communication networks and mitigate risks to our assets, data, employees and customers. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan which is regularly updated to include structured processes encompassing preparation, identification, notification, containment, analysis, eradication, recovery and follow up. 
 
 We have designed and assessed our program based on the Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls) and Safeguards. This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that we use the CIS Controls as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business. 
 
 Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas. 
 
 Our cybersecurity risk management program includes: 
 
 responsibility for inventory and control of enterprise and software assets, technical and administrative controls and testing of our controls and security measures; 
 
 risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment; 
 
 a security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents; 
 
 the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls, including monitoring and alerting; 
 
 cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management; and 
 
 a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents. 
 
 There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information. 
 
 We have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. We face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See Risk Factors Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication; a successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems, or those of our third-party service providers, or cause the loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business, force us to incur excessive costs or cause reputational harm. 
 
 39 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Cybersecurity Governance 
 
 Our Board of Directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee oversees management s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program. 
 
 The Audit Committee receives regular reports from management on our cybersecurity risks and reviews our cybersecurity program on at least an annual basis, or more frequently as necessary or advisable. In addition, the Audit Committee is informed, as necessary, regarding material cybersecurity incidents, as well as incidents with lesser impact potential. 
 
 The Audit Committee reports to the full Board of Directors regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The Board of Directors also receives an annual briefing from our Chief Information Officer, or CIO, on our cybersecurity program, including risks and priorities. 
 
 Our cybersecurity program is led by our CIO, who has over 30 years of experience in information technology. Our CIO leads a credentialed and experienced Information Security team who has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and who supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants. Our Enterprise Risk Leadership Team, including our Executive Vice President Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel, is responsible for assessing and managing our material enterprise risks, including risks from cybersecurity threats. 
 
 Our Information Security team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.

 In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under Capital Resources and Liquidity. For a discussion related to fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on December 8, 2023, and is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at investor.coopercos.com. 
 
 Within the tables presented, percentages are calculated based on the underlying whole-dollar amounts and, therefore, may not recalculate exactly from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. 
 Outlook 
 
 We are optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and general health care markets, and the resilience of and growth prospects for our businesses and products. However, we face significant risks and uncertainties in our global operating environment as further described in the Risk Factors section in Part I, Item 1A of this filing. These risks include uncertain global and regional business, political and economic conditions, including but not limited to those associated with man-made or natural disasters, pandemic conditions, inflation, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, regulatory developments, supply chain disruptions, and escalating global trade barriers. These risks and uncertainties have adversely affected our sales, cash flow and performance in the past and could further adversely affect our future sales, cash flow and performance. 
 CooperVision - We compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical, toric, multifocal and toric multifocal contact lenses offered in materials like silicone hydrogel Aquaform technology. We believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as single-use and monthly wearing options. CooperVision also competes in the myopia management and specialty eye care contact lens markets with myopia management contact lenses using its ActivControl technology and with products such as orthokeratology (ortho-k) and scleral lenses. CooperVision has FDA approval for its MiSight 1 day lens, which is the first and only FDA-approved product indicated to slow the progression of myopia in children with treatment initiated between the ages of 8-12. Further, CooperVision has Chinese NMPA approval for its MiSight 1 day lens for use in China. CooperVision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration using recently introduced products, and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets, including through acquisitions. 
 Our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our desired future levels of sales growth and profitability. CooperVision manufactures and markets a wide variety of silicone hydrogel contact lenses. Our single-use silicone hydrogel product franchises, clariti, MyDay and MyDay Energys remain a focus as we expect increasing demand for these products, as well as future single-use products, as the global contact lens market continues to shift to this modality. Outside of single-use, the Biofinity and Avaira Vitality product families comprise our focus in the FRP, or frequent replacement product, market which encompasses the monthly and two-week modalities. Included in this segment are unique products such as Biofinity Energys, which helps individuals with digital eye fatigue. 
 CooperSurgical - Our CooperSurgical business competes in the fertility and women's health care market through its diversified portfolio of products and services, including fertility products and services, medical devices, cryostorage (such as cord blood and cord tissue storage) and contraception. CooperSurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring companies, products and services that complement its business model. 
 Competitive factors in the segments in which CooperSurgical competes include technological and scientific advances, product quality and availability, price and customer service (including response time and effective communication of product information to physicians, consumers, fertility clinics and hospitals).

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 Working capital at October 31, 2024, and October 31, 2023, was 928.7 million and 735.9 million, respectively. The increase in working capital was primarily due to increases in trade accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities.

 Investing Cash Flow 
 
 Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2024 increased compared to cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023, primarily attributable to 343.4 million cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal 2024. 
 
 Financing Cash Flow 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2024 was primarily attributable to funds received from the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by repayments to fully repay all borrowings outstanding under the 2020 Term Loan Facility and the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 5. Financing Arrangements for further information. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to repayments of 338.0 million on the 2021 364-day term loan, partially offset by 172.6 million of funds drawn on the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 The following is a summary of the maximum commitments and the net amounts available to us under different credit facilities as of October 31, 2024:

 As of October 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. On May 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company drew on the 2024 Credit Agreement to fully repay borrowings outstanding under the 2020 Term Loan and 2020 Revolving Credit Facility and terminated the 2020 Credit Agreement. See Note 5. Financing Arrangements for further information. 
 
 Considering recent market conditions, we have re-evaluated our operating cash flows and cash requirements and continue to believe that current cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow from operating activities and cash available under our 2024 Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including working capital needs, capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our liquidity needs such as 
 51

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

for acquisitions, share repurchases or other activities as we execute our business strategy, we anticipate that additional funds could be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 In March 2017, the authorization under the 2012 Share Repurchase Program (2012 Program) was increased to 1.0 billion by the Company's Board of Directors. As of October 31, 2024, 256.4 million remained authorized for repurchase under the program. See Note 8. Stockholders Equity for additional information. In fiscal 2024, there were no share repurchases under the 2012 Program. 
 Dividends 
 In December 2023, the Company's Board of Directors decided to end the declaration of the semiannual dividend. 
 Stock Split 
 On February 16, 2024, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split for all periods presented. The par value of the common stock remains 0.10 per share. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 As of October 31, 2024, our material cash requirements consisted of future payments for debt and related interests, income tax liabilities related to one-time transition tax, purchase obligations, operating lease and Retirement Income Plan. 
 
 We incur interest on a revolving loan and a term loan. Using the same interest rate of October 31, 2024, and assuming borrowings as of October 31, 2024, remain constant throughout all periods, these loans would result in interest payments of 109.5 million in the twelve months ending October 31, 2025, and 272.1 million in the years thereafter. See Note 5. Financing Arrangements for additional information related to debt and interests. 
 
 Income tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax resulted from the enactment of the 2017 U.S. Tax Act and are payable in annual installments through fiscal 2026. The installment for fiscal 2024 is classified in "Other current liabilities" in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions and have excluded 20.4 million of long-term income taxes payable. See Note 6. Income Taxes for the expected one-time transition tax payments. 
 
 Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and includes obligations for inventory, capital expenditures and other operating expense commitments. As of October 31, 2024, we had purchase obligations of 696.0 million, with 272.8 million payable within the twelve months ending Oct 31, 2025. 
 
 The minimum future payments for operating leases are disclosed in Note 2. Operating Leases and the expected future benefit payments for our Retirement Income Plan through 2033 are disclosed in Note 10. Employee Benefits.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable, however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future period. The critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. 
 Revenue recognition - We recognize revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers and/or when services are rendered. Our payment terms are typically between 30 to 120 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances and product returns are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. Estimating these provisions requires judgment based on current and historical customer patterns related to these programs or contractual terms as described below. 
 Product discounts, including certain rebates, sales incentives, and volume discounts are granted based on terms of the arrangement with direct distribution customers and at times the indirect end consumer. We evaluate contractual terms, historical experience, and perform internal analysis to estimate total product discounts at the time revenue is recognized. Variations between our estimates and actual product discounts have not been material. CooperSurgical rebates are predominately related to the Medicaid rebate provision that is estimated based upon contractual terms, historical experience, and trend analysis which requires judgment due to the length of time between sale and reimbursement from Medicaid. 
 Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales return data. Promotional programs, such as cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, sales incentives, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances and product returns are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. We currently disclose the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. 
 Business combinations - We routinely consummate business combinations. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. We recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process research and development (IPR D), the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets is determined primarily using the income approach. Key assumptions routinely utilized in the income approach to allocate the purchase price to intangible assets include risk-adjusted discount rates and projected financial information such as revenue projections, expected gross and operating margins for the acquired companies. The fair value of IPR D also factors in probability assumptions about the stage of development and successful completion. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill. 
 Income taxes - Income taxes are estimated based on enacted income tax laws and the results of operations in each jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are estimated based on temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Judgment is required in measuring the value of deferred tax assets, which are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not the assets are not expected to be realized. These deferred tax assets are primarily tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards expected to expire before they can be claimed or deducted. For uncertain tax positions, judgment is required in evaluating tax positions for uncertainty in the application of accounting guidance and tax laws. A tax benefit is recognized if it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax authority examination, based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. We do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide. As a result, our earnings, cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, sales transactions, capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations. Most of our operations outside the United States have their local currency as their functional currency. We have exposure to multiple foreign currencies, including, among others, the British pound, Euro and Japanese yen. We have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables. 
 At October 31, 2024, a uniform hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the value of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a corresponding increase or decrease of approximately 103.2 million in operating income for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - " Our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our business. " and Note 1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies for further information. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rates on our revolving lines of credit and term loans may vary with the federal funds rate and SOFR. As of October 31, 2024, we had outstanding debt for an aggregate carrying amount of 2.6 billion. We have entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. 
 Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates, the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time. As an example, if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points, the quarterly interest expense would not have a material impact, based on average debt outstanding, after consideration of our interest rate swap contracts, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - " We are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt. " and Note 5. Financing Arrangements for further information.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors 
 The Cooper Companies, Inc.: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Cooper Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated December 6, 2024 expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over inventories and net sales 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of income, the Company recorded 802.7 million in inventories and 3,895.4 million in net sales as of and for the year ended October 31, 2024, respectively. Inventories are primarily comprised of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods that are physically located at certain of the Company's locations. Net sales are recognized primarily from the sale of products from each of the Company's locations. 
 
 We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over inventories and net sales as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained required subjective auditor judgment because of the decentralized structure and geographic dispersion of the Company's manufacturing and distribution locations. This included determining the locations for which procedures were performed. 
 
 55 

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over inventories and net sales, including the determination of the Company s locations for which those procedures were performed. For certain locations where procedures were performed, we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's inventories and net sales processes, including controls over the amounts recorded in inventories and the amounts recorded in net sales. We assessed the recorded inventories for each location where procedures were performed by participating in a physical inventory count and observing a sample of inventories on hand and comparing the cost recorded for a sample of inventories on hand to underlying documentation. We assessed recorded net sales for each location where procedures were performed by selecting a sample of net sales transactions and comparing the amount recognized to underlying documentation, such as contracts with customers and shipping documentation. We evaluated the overall sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed over inventories and net sales, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of audit effort.

 The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. The discount rate used for the Plan is based primarily on the yields of a universe of high-quality corporate bonds rated AA or above, with durations corresponding to the expected durations of the benefit obligations. A change in the discount rate will cause the present value of benefit obligations to change in the opposite direction. 
 
 The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on a review of historical returns, both for this plan and for medium- to large-sized defined benefit pension funds with similar asset allocations. This review generated separate expected returns for each asset class listed below. These expected future returns were then blended based on this Plan's target asset allocation. 
 
 Reasons for Significant Liability Gains and Losses 
 
 The projected benefit obligation experienced a net loss of approximately million during the year. This net loss is the result of assumption changes resulting in a loss of approximately million and a loss of approximately million due to demographic experience. The key assumption changes were a decrease in the discount rate (loss of million), change in assumptions for lump sum determination (loss of million), an increase in expected future salaries (loss of million), and 
 81

million). Changes in demographic experience were due to the net effect of retirement rates, termination rates, salary increases and other experience that was different from assumed. 
 
 Corporate common stock Equity mutual funds Balanced funds Alternative investments Bond mutual funds Total 
 
 The Plan invests in a diversified portfolio of assets intended to minimize risk of poor returns while maximizing expected portfolio returns. To achieve the long-term rate of return, plan assets will be invested in a mixture of instruments, including but not limited to, corporate common stock (may include the Company's stock), investment grade bond funds, cash, balanced funds, real estate funds, small or large cap equity funds and international equity funds. The allocation of assets will be determined by the investment manager and will typically include to equities with the remainder invested in fixed income, hedging strategy funds and cash. Presently, this diversified portfolio is expected to return roughly in the long run.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 In conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter, the Company conducts a review and evaluation, with participation of the Company's management, and under the oversight of the Board of Directors, including the Chief Executive Officer (our Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer based upon their evaluation as of October 31, 2024, the end of the fiscal period covered in this report, concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weakness described below. In light of this material weakness, management performed additional analyses and other procedures. As a result of these additional procedures, the Company believes that the consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.. 
 
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, errors or fraud. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management, with participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and under the oversight of the Board of Directors, concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of October 31, 2024 due to a material weakness in information technology (IT) general controls for the U.S. operations within the CooperSurgical segment, related to the implementation and maintenance of certain enterprise resource planning systems (ERP) during fiscal year 2024. The material weakness resulted from not having a sufficient complement of its personnel, inadequate training of personnel and ineffective risk assessment processes to identify and timely respond to the risks related to change management, user control monitoring and segregation of duties in the affected IT environment. Manual controls that rely on system-generated data or reports from the affected IT environment or process level automated controls in the affected IT environment were ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Although these control deficiencies did not result in any material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented, there is a possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, management has concluded that these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness.

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, as stated in their report in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Management s Plan for Remediation 
 
 In response to the material weakness, management, with oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has begun to implement steps to remediate the material weakness. Our internal control remediation efforts include the following: 
 Enhancing risk assessment and procedures over our IT general controls for the affected environments; 
 Developing the skill sets of employees and additional training programs addressing IT general controls and policies with a focus on those related to change management, user access and segregation of duties over IT systems impacting financial reporting; 
 Enhancing controls supporting change management to ensure systems integrity as well as user access monitoring controls to enforce appropriate system access and segregation of duties. 
 
 We are committed to ensuring that our internal control over financial reporting are designed and operating effectively. Management believes the efforts taken to date and the planned remediation will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. While these remediation efforts are ongoing, the controls must be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time and be tested by management in order to consider them remediated and conclude that the design is effective to address the risks of material misstatement. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the year ended October 31, 2024, the implementation of a new ERP system at our primary U.S. operations of the Cooper Surgical segment impacted our internal control over financial reporting. Except for the system implementation and the identification of the material weakness described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended October 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors 
 The Cooper Companies, Inc.: 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited The Cooper Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness, described below, on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated December 6, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness resulting from control deficiencies in information technology general controls related to the implementation and maintenance of certain enterprise resource planning systems for the U.S. operations within the CooperSurgical segment has been identified and included in management s assessment. The material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
