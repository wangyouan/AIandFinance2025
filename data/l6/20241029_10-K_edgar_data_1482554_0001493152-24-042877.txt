1. BUSINESS. 

General 

Hartford
Creative Group, Inc. (Former name Hartford Great Health Corp.) was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008 under
the name PhotoAmigo, Inc. It changed its name to Hartford Great Health Corp. on August 22, 2018. On May 11, 2024, the Company further
changed its name to Hartford Creative Group, Inc. 

Overview 

Through
its wholly owned subsidiary - Hangzhou Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd HZHF) and HZHF s 60 percent owned
subsidiary - Hangzhou Longjing Qiao Fu Vacation Hotel Co., Ltd. HZLJ ), and through Shanghai Hartford Health Management,
Ltd. HFSH and its 90 percent owned subsidiary - Shanghai Qiao Garden International Travel Agency Qiao Garden
Int l Travel ), the Company engages in hospitality industry in China. Qiao Garden Int l Travel was disposed on December
31, 2020. 

The
Company started to engage in early childhood education industry at Hartford International Education Technology Co., Ltd HF Int l
Education ). On July 24, 2019 and March 23, 2020, HF Int l Education established two 100 owned subsidiaries, Pudong Haojin
Childhood Education Ltd. PDHJ and Shanghai Hongkou HaiDeFuDe Childcare Co., Ltd.( HDFD ), respectively, to
operate the early childhood education service under the brand name of HaiDeFuDe in Shanghai, China. On July 20, 2020, HF
Int l Education entered an agreement with two individuals to acquire the whole ownership of Shanghai Gelinke Childcare Education
Center Gelinke ). Gelinke temporally ceased its operations by the end of August 2021. On August 31, 2021, PDHJ established
one 96 owned subsidiary, Shanghai HDFD Zhongli Education Technology Co., Ltd. Zhongli ), two individual investors hold
the remaining 4 ownership. 

Impacted
by the government regulation implemented in education industry and the restrictions posted by the Chinese government to control the pandemic
in China since 2021, to avoid further operation losses, on August 1, 2022, HFSH entered a contract with a related party, Shanghai Oversea
Chinese Culture Media Ltd. SH Oversea ), to sell 90 percent ownership of HF Int l Education and its subsidiaries
for 900 (RMB 5,850). On August 1, 2022, HFUS entered a contract with SH Oversea and another individual, to sell 100 percent ownership
of HZHF and its subsidiaries for 1,000 (RMB 6,500). See Note 3 Acquisitions and Disposals. 

Beginning
in January 2024, the Company embarked on the development of a new business within the Media and Marketing sector. As part of its rebranding
strategy, on January 10, 2024, HFSH changed its legal name from Shanghai Hartford Health Management, Ltd. to Shanghai Hartford ZY Culture
Media Ltd. HFZY ). HFZY mainly engage in social media advertising business on mainstream social media platforms such as
Tik Tok, Toutiao, Kwai, RED, WeChat, and more. As an advertising partner of China s major social media platforms, the Company relies
on a high-quality and professional media strategy execution team and network to help customers use the massive media resources of different
types of social media platforms and receive competitive prices due to large-scale media resource procurement to purchase media resources.
It aims to become one of the total solution advertising providers for domestic social media industry in China and provide customers with
vertical integration services from early-stage advertising video creativity, shooting, editing, to advertising operation and management
on social media apps. Further expanding its business operations, on April 1, 2024, HFUS reacquired full ownership of HZHF at no cost
and subsequently rebranded it as Hangzhou Hartford WP Culture Media Ltd. HZWP ). On April 11, 2024, HFUS continued its
growth trajectory by establishing a new subsidiary named Shanghai DZ Culture Media Ltd. SHDZ ). On June 18, 2024, HFUS
successfully completed the acquisition of ShangXing HuoMao Network Technology Ltd. (SXHM). The acquisition was executed at no cost, and
there were no significant assets or liabilities exchanged during the transfer. 

Based
on market research and discussions between the Board and third-party suppliers and experts, the Company developed a plan for a mini-drama
business. The Company aims to attract significant attention and boost mini-drama revenue. Only preliminary activities relating to this
objective have been undertaken and, therefore, there is no assurance that the business plan will be successful. 

The
Company s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. At present, the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders,
its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with the Company. There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable.

ITEM
5. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY. RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Market
Information 

Our
common stock has been listed on the OTC Markets Group under the symbol HFUS. There has been limited trading in our shares,
meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at any given time has been relatively small or non-existent.
We intend to apply to have our common stock listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol HFUS . There can be no
assurance that our listing application will be approved. There is no assurance that an active trading market will ever develop or, if
such a market does develop, that it will continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the
definition of a penny stock, for purposes relevant to the Company, as any equity security that has a market price of less
than 5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving
a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (i) that a broker or dealer approve a person s account for transactions in penny
stocks and (ii) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and
quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker
or dealer must (i) obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person and (ii) make a reasonable determination
that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial
matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction
in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, (i)
sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and (ii) that the broker or dealer received a signed,
written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks
in both public offerings and in secondary trading, and about commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative,
current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions.
Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information
on the limited market in penny stocks. 

Because
of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to buy or sell shares of our common stock, which may
affect the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading
activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our common stock
in the market place. In addition, the liquidity for our common stock may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of
our common stock. Our shares are likely to be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future. 

On
October 23, 2024, the closing price of our common stock reported on the OTC Markets was 1.22 per share. The following table sets forth,
for each of the quarterly periods indicated, the high and low sales prices of our common stock, as reported on the OTC Markets.

Penny
Stock Rules 

Due
to the price of our common stock, as well as the fact that we are not listed on Nasdaq or a national securities exchange, our stock is
characterized as penny stocks under applicable securities regulations. Our stock will therefore be subject to rules adopted
by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regulating broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny
stocks. The broker or dealer proposing to affect a transaction in a penny stock must furnish his customer a document containing information
prescribed by the SEC and obtain from the customer an executed acknowledgment of receipt of that document. The broker or dealer must
also provide the customer with pricing information regarding the security prior to the transaction and with the written confirmation
of the transaction. The broker or dealer must also disclose the aggregate amount of any compensation received or receivable by him in
connection with such transaction prior to consummating the transaction and with the written confirmation of the trade. The broker or
dealer must also send an account statement to each customer for which he has executed a transaction in a penny stock each month in which
such security is held for the customer s account. The existence of these rules may have an effect on the price of our stock, and
the willingness of certain brokers to effect transactions in our stock. 

Transfer
Agent 

We
have appointed Legacy Stock Transfer, Inc., as the transfer agent for our common stock. The principal office of Legacy Stock Transfer
is located at 16801 Addison Road, Suite 247, Addison, Texas 75001 and its telephone number is (972) 612-4120. 

Dividend
Policy 

We
have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. Payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board
of Directors after taking into account various factors, including the terms of any credit arrangements, our financial condition, operating
results, current and anticipated cash needs and plans for expansion. At the present time, we intend to retain any earning in our business,
and therefore do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.

Overview
of the Business 

Hartford
Creative Group, Inc. (Formerly name Hartford Great Health Corp.) was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008
under the name PhotoAmigo, Inc. It changed its name to Hartford Great Health Corp. on August 22, 2018, and since then we have been engaged
in activities to formulate and implement our business plan as set forth below. On May 11, 2024, the Company further changed its name
to Hartford Creative Group, Inc. 

Ability
to continue as a going concern . 

The
independent registered public accounting firms reports on our financial statements as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, includes a going
concern explanatory paragraph that describes substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans regarding the factors prompting the explanatory paragraph are discussed in the financial statements, including
footnotes thereto. 

Plan
of Operation 

As
of July 31, 2024, the Company has issued a total of 100,108,000 shares of common stock. On December 11, 2018, 96,090,000 shares of common
stock were issued at the price of 0.02 per share to raise an additional 1,921,800 in capital. On November 24, 2020, the Company issued
additional 1,000,000 shares of common stock to a significant shareholder of the Company at 0.02 per share. 

On
December 28, 2018, the Company acquired Hangzhou Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd HZHF ). On March 22, 2019,
the Company acquired 60 percent of Hangzhou Longjing Qiao Fu Vacation Hotel Co., Ltd. HZLJ ). On March 20, 2019, the Company
acquired Shanghai Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd. HFSH ). Since 2019, HFSH had acquired and formed multiple
subsidiaries and tried to develop the childhood education and childcare business. Impacted by Covid-19 pandemic and the government regulation
implemented in education industry and the restrictions posted by the Chinese government to control the pandemic in China since 2021,
to avoid further operation losses, on August 1, 2022, HFSH entered a contract with a related party, Shanghai Oversea Chinese Culture
Media Ltd. SH Oversea ), to sell its subsidiaries for 900 (RMB 5,850). On August 1, 2022, HFUS entered a contract with
SH Oversea and another individual, to sell HZHF and its subsidiaries for 1,000 (RMB 6,500). 

The
Company s subsidiary, HFSH was working with herbal manufacturers to develop new herbal health supplement products for wholesale
distribution in China. Due to deflation in China, demand of herbal health supplement was lower than expected. Therefore, HFSH decided
to deviate from its prior business focus and to engage in social media advertising endeavors. On January 10, 2024, HFSH changed its legal
name from Shanghai Hartford Health Management, Ltd. to Hartford ZY Culture Media (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., hereon refer to as HFZY .
On June 18, 2024, the Company successfully completed the acquisition of ShangXing HuoMao Network Technology Ltd. (SXHM). HFZY and SXHM
started to deliver media and advertisement services. The pent-up demand from social media influencers marketing needs on social
media apps lead the Company to seize the opportunity in providing advertisement services. the Company begins to engage in social media
advertising business on mainstream social media platforms such as Tik Tok, Toutiao, Kwai, RED, WeChat, and more. As an advertising partner
of China s major social media platforms, it aims to provide customers with vertical integration services from early-stage advertising
video creativity, photograph shooting, editing, to advertising operation and management on social media apps. The Company will also gradually
launch overseas TikTok advertising campaign, providing social media advertising solutions for domestic Chinese customers to engage in
international markets in the United States. 

Since
January 2024, the Company has entered advertising service contracts with thirty customers and received approximately RMB 98.4 million
(USD 13.6 million) as advanced payment from these customers. the Company also entered twenty supplier contracts for advertising placement
and prepaid RMB 90.8 million (USD 12.6 million). During the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company recognized USD 1.3 million net revenue
from the advertisement placement services. The Company provides service to place advertisements. The advertisements are published on
the targeted media platforms as determined by the customers. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the placement of advertisements
is completed. As disclosed in Note 1 under category Revenue Recognition , the Company is not the principal in executing
these transactions. The Company reports the amount received from the customers and the amounts paid to the media platforms or upside
agent related to these transactions on a net basis. The Company expects the number of customers to grow and the advertising service revenue
will significantly increase in the next few months due to the vast demand in social media advertising services. 

Based
on market research and discussions between the Board and third-party suppliers and experts, the Company has further developed a plan
of mini-drama business. The Company is strategically positioned to capture considerable market interest and enhance revenue streams from
our innovative mini-drama business. While initial steps toward this ambitious goal have been initiated, it is important to note that
the commencement and future success of the mini-drama venture are not yet guaranteed.

while 62,443 was derived from the design, creation, and placement of video advertisements for Shanghai DuBian Assets Management Ltd. SH Dubian ), which is managed by our major shareholder s relatives. As both early childhood education services and
hospitality services have been sold on August 1, 2022, there was no revenue recognized for the year ended July 31, 2023. 

Operating
Cost and Expenses: Cost of revenue increased to 55,505 for the year ended July 31, 2024, in contrast to no cost of revenue in
the corresponding period of 2023. The increase of Cost of revenue was mainly due to the increase of the revenue derived from the services
provided to SH Dubian. During the year ended July 31, 2024, the selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 247,920 compared
to 123,650 during the comparable period of 2023. The increase was due to the increase of professional expenses as a result of the expansion
of business operation. 

Other
Income (Expense): Other income, net amount of 6,971 for the year ended July 31, 2024, compared to Other income, net amount of
 521,353 for the corresponding period of 2023. The primary source of other income was the 29,022 recovery from Mr. Song, following a
Section 16 infraction as outlined in Note 4 Related Party Transactions to our Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount was
partially offset by the interest expenses on loans from related parties. Other income for the year ended July 31, 2023, mainly resulted
from the gain on disposal of subsidiaries offset by interest expenses. 

Income
tax expense: The income tax recognized for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, resulted from the income tax from the operating
income in China and offset by the deferred tax effects of temporary differences as of July 31, 2024, see Note 10 Income Taxes to
our Consolidated Financial Statements. The deferred tax assets are expected to reduce future income tax liabilities. The income tax for
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 was the amount paid for state franchise income tax in California. 

Net
Income (Loss): We recorded a net income of 1,092,874 or 0.01 per share for the year ended July 31, 2024, compared to a net
income of 396,903 or 0.00 per share for the year ended July 31, 2023, due to the factors discussed above.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of July 31, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 3,565,965 comprised of current assets of 3,472,709 and current liabilities of
 7,038,674. This represents a decrease of 924,471 in the working capital deficit from the July 31, 2023 amount of 4,490,436. We had
an accumulated deficit of 5,910,843 compared to 7,003,717 at the previous year end. To date, we have funded our operations through
short-term debt and equity financing. 

As
of July 31, 2024, the Company has issued a total of 100,108,000 shares of common stock. On December 11, 2018, 96,090,000 shares of common
stock were issued at the price of 0.02 per share to raise an additional 1,921,800 in capital. On November 24, 2020, the Company issued
additional 1,000,000 shares of common stock to a significant shareholder of the Company at 0.02 per share. 

We
will seek additional financing in the form of debt or equity. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any needed financing
on favorable terms, or at all, or that we will find qualified purchasers for the sale of our stock. If we are unable to raise sufficient
capital, we will be required to delay or forego some of our business plan, which would have a material adverse effect on our anticipated
results from operations and financial condition. Any sales of our securities would dilute the ownership of our existing investors. 

Future
Capital Expenditures 

We
believe that our funding requirements for the next twelve months will be in excess of 2,000,000. We are currently seeking further funding
through related parties loan and finance. 

We
are currently engaging consultants to evaluate and facilitate the potential uplisting of the Company s stock from the OTC market
to the Nasdaq exchange. If all conditions align favorably, the Company intends to secure financing through either debt or equity. The
funds raised will be allocated to cover the expenses associated with the uplisting process.

Accounting
Policies and Pronouncements 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the
most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that have had, or are reasonably
likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially
different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. See Part II, Item 8 Financial
Statements Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a summary of our significant accounting policies. 

The
following summarizes our most significant critical accounting estimates: 

Foreign
Currency: The accounts of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses
resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are
recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. The Company does not undertake hedging transactions
to cover its foreign currency exposure. 

Revenue
Recognition: The Company follows the five steps approach for revenue recognition under Topic 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with
a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. Billings
to customers for which services are not rendered are considered deferred revenue. The Company s revenue is recognized when it satisfies
a single performance obligation by transferring control of its products or providing services to a customer. The Company s general
payment terms are short-term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms. 

The
Company is developing business plan and aim to provide customers with vertical integration services from early-stage advertising video
creativity, shooting, editing, to advertising operation and management on social media apps. Most of the advertising revenue will be
generated by placing ad products on Tik Tok, Toutiao, Kwai, RED, WeChat, and other third-party affiliated websites and mobile applications.
Currently, the Company provides traffic acquisition service to place the advertisements produced by the advertisers. The advertisements
are published on the targeted media platforms as determined by the customers. Besides, the Company provides advertisements account charging
service to customers upon the request from customers. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the distribution of advertisements
and charging of advertisement accounts are completed upon the completion confirmation from the customers and suppliers.

ITEM
8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Shareholders
and Board of Directors 

 Hartford
Creative Group, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hartford Creative Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders 
deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial
statements. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period
ended July 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern Uncertainty 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring negative working capitals and accumulated deficits
that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s evaluation of the events and conditions
and management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or
disclosures to which it relates. 

Revenue
recognition determination of principal versus agent 

As
described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the revenue is recognized on a gross or net basis based on whether the
Company acts as a principal by controlling the service provided to the consumer, or whether it acts as an agent by arranging for third
parties to provide the service to the consumer. During the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company provides traffic acquisition service
to place the advertisements produced by the advertisers. The advertisements are published on the targeted media platforms as determined
by the customers. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the distribution of advertisements and charging of advertisement accounts
are completed upon the completion confirmations provided by customers and suppliers, respectively. The Company is therefore acting as
an agent. 

We
identified the determination of principal versus agent for revenue recognition related to the advertisement placement service as a critical
audit matter. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate whether the Company acted as either a principal or an
agent with respect to whether the Company controls the promised service. 

The
primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 

Obtained
 understanding of the service agreements between the Company and customers, the Company and
 media platforms or agent of the media platforms for advertisement placement services provided. 
 
 Performed
 walkthroughs of sales and purchase transactions to confirm the working flows of the key business
 cycles. 
 
 Obtained
 revenue recognition memo including analysis of principal versus agent along with the management s
 conclusion. 
 
 Assessed
 management s conclusion by analyzing whether the Company controls the promised service
 provided pursuant to the terms and conditions with media platforms and/or agent of media
 platforms, including but not limit to latitude in establishing price and taking risk of service
 cost. 
 
 Sent
 sales confirmations and interviewed customers on a sample basis to verify the service delivered
 and the parties who delivered the service. 
 Leveraged the testing result of substantive testing of revenue recognition to further evaluate the management s conclusion.

Impacted
by the government regulation implemented in education industry and the restrictions posted by the Chinese government to control the pandemic
in China since 2021, to avoid further operation losses, on August 1, 2022, HFSH entered a contract with a related party, Shanghai Oversea
Chinese Culture Media Ltd. SH Oversea ), to sell percent ownership of HF Int l Education and its subsidiaries
for (RMB ). On August 1, 2022, HFUS entered a contract with SH Oversea and another individual, to sell percent ownership
of HZHF and its subsidiaries for (RMB ). See Note 3 Acquisitions and Disposals. 

Beginning
in January 2024, the Company embarked on the development of a new business within the Media and Marketing sector. As part of its rebranding
strategy, on January 01, 2024, HFSH changed its legal name from Shanghai Hartford Health Management, Ltd. to Shanghai Hartford ZY Culture
Media Ltd. HFZY ). HFZY mainly engage in social media advertising business on mainstream social media platforms such as
Tik Tok, Toutiao, Kwai, RED, WeChat, and more. As an advertising partner of China s major social media platforms, the Company relies
on a high-quality and professional media strategy execution team and network to help customers use the massive media resources of different
types of social media platforms and receive competitive prices due to large-scale media resource procurement to purchase media resources.
It aims to become one of the total solution advertising providers for domestic social media industry in China and provide customers with
vertical integration services from early-stage advertising video creativity, shooting, editing, to advertising operation and management
on social media apps. Further expanding its business operations, HFUS reacquired full ownership of HZHF at no cost on April 1, 2024,
and subsequently rebranded it as Hangzhou Hartford WP Culture Media Ltd. HZWP ). On April 11, 2024, HFUS continued its
growth trajectory by establishing a new subsidiary named Shanghai DZ Culture Media Ltd. SHDZ ). On June 18, 2024, HFUS

million (USD 
million) as advanced payment from these customers. the Company also entered about 20 supplier contracts for advertising placement
and prepaid RMB 
million (USD 
million). During the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company recognized USD 
million placement revenue from providing advertisement placement services. The Company provides traffic acquisition service to place
advertisements for our customers. The advertisements are published on the targeted media platforms as determined by the customers. The Company is not the principal in this
arrangement as the Company does not control the specified service (i.e., the traffic) before that service is delivered to the
customer, because (i) it is the targeted media platform, rather than the Company, who is primarily responsible for providing the
media publishing service; (ii) the media platforms are identified and determined by the customers, rather than the Company, and the
Company does not commit to acquire the traffic before transferring to the customers. Therefore, the Company is not the principal in
executing these transactions. The Company reports the amount received from the customers and the amounts paid to the media suppliers
related to these transactions as placement revenue on a net basis. 

Generally, the Company pays suppliers upfront for
media resources and collects prepayments from customers. Under certain status, credit terms of up to 90 days may be granted. As of July
31, 2024, the Company had outstanding receivables due from two customers. 

During
the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company also generated revenue from designing, making, and placing video advertising for our
related party customers, primarily Shanghai DuBian Assets Management Ltd. SH Dubian ), which is managed by our major shareholder s
relatives. 

In
the years before August 1, 2022, the Company s main operations were focusing on early childhood education and hospitality services. Impacted by
the Covid-19 pandemic and Chinese regulation on education industry, both early childhood education services and hospitality services
have been sold on August 1 2022. Thus, there was no revenue recognized for the year ended July 31, 2023. See Note 3 Acquisitions and
Disposals. 

and
an accumulated deficit of .
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of Hartford Creative Group, Inc. to continue as a going
concern. 

In
view of these matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon several factors, including the availability of debt or equity
funding upon terms and conditions acceptable to the Company, and ultimately achieving profitable operations. Management believes that
the Company s business plan provides it with an opportunity to continue as a going concern. However, management cannot provide
assurance that the Company will meet its objectives and be able to continue in operation. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going
concern.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

An
evaluation was performed under the supervision of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal
financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of July 31, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms due to material weaknesses
in our internal controls described below. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control system is intended to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements and that we have controls and procedures designed to
ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we will be required to file under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely and informed decisions regarding financial disclosure. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024. Based on this assessment,
management believes that as of July 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria. 

Management s
assessment identified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses include
the following: 

The Company did not implement sufficient working procedures and maintain proper accounting supporting for the new
business operation model at the operational subsidiary level 

Inherent
Limitations Over Internal Controls 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our control systems are designed to provide
such reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls
also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

We
have made no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal year that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Attestation
Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report on Form 10-K.
