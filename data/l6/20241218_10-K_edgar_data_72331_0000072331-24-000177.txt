 Item 1. Business 
 
 General Description of Business 
 Nordson is an innovative precision technology company that leverages a scalable growth framework to deliver top tier growth with leading margins and returns. We engineer, manufacture and market differentiated products and systems used for precision dispensing, applying and controlling of adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces and various medical products such as: catheters, cannulas, medical balloons and medical tubing. These products are supported with extensive application expertise and direct global sales and service. We serve a wide variety of consumer non-durable, consumer durable and technology end markets including packaging, electronics, medical, appliances, energy, transportation, precision agriculture, building and construction, and general product assembly and finishing. 
 Our strategy for long-term growth is based on solving customers needs globally. We were incorporated in the State of Ohio in 1954 and are headquartered in Westlake, Ohio. Our products are marketed through a network of direct operations in more than 35 countries. Consistent with this global strategy, approximately 67 percent of our revenues were generated outside the United States in 2024. 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had approximately 8,000 employees worldwide. Our principal manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, the People s Republic of China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. 
 
 Corporate Purpose and Goals 
 We strive to be a vital, self-renewing, worldwide organization that, within the framework of ethical behavior and enlightened citizenship, grows and produces wealth for our customers, employees, shareholders and communities. 
 We operate for the purpose of creating balanced, long-term benefits for all of our constituencies. 
 We focus on long-term growth and returns. Each quarter, we may not produce increased sales, net income, or earnings per share, or exceed the comparative prior year's quarter. When short-term swings occur, we do not intend to alter our foundational objectives in efforts to mitigate the impact of these temporary occurrences. 
 In 2021, we launched the Ascend strategy, which is designed to deliver top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. Ascend is driven by three interconnected pillars: the NBS ("Nordson Business System") Next growth framework; Owner Mindset, our division-led organizational structure; and Winning Teams, our talent strategy. These three pillars are built upon the foundation of what makes Nordson special: our culture and our values. 
 The NBS Next growth framework, the heart of the Ascend strategy, uses data-based segmentation to identify our greatest opportunities for profitable growth and ensure we are investing our resources in those areas. Using data in a consistent and disciplined way, leaders across the Company are defining their strategic business priorities. 
 We drive organic growth by continually introducing new products and technology, providing high levels of customer service and support, capturing rapidly expanding opportunities in emerging geographies and leveraging existing technology into new applications. Additional growth comes through the acquisition of companies that have differentiated precision technology-based product portfolios, serve attractive high-growth end-markets applications and have a customer-centric business model. The primary goals of our acquisition strategy are to complement our current capabilities, diversify our business into new industry sectors with new customers and expand the scope of the solutions we can offer to our customers. 
 We strive to provide genuine customer satisfaction it is the foundation upon which we continue to build our business. 
 Complementing our business strategy is the objective to provide opportunities for employee self-fulfillment, growth, security, recognition and equitable compensation. This goal is met through the Human Resources department s facilitation of employee training, leadership training and the creation of on-the-job growth opportunities. The result is a highly qualified and 
 Nordson Corporation 4 

Table of Contents 

 professional global team capable of meeting corporate objectives. For more information, see "Human Capital Resources" below. 
 We recognize the value of employee participation in the planning process. Strategic and operating plans are developed by all divisions, resulting in a sense of ownership and commitment on the part of employees in accomplishing our objectives. 
 We are an equal opportunity employer. 
 At Nordson, we have a long and proud history of investing in the communities where we live and work. We are committed to contributing up to five percent of domestic pretax earnings to education, human welfare services and other charitable activities, particularly in communities where we have significant operations. Through the Nordson Corporation Foundation, we give back by providing grants to nonprofits in communities where we have facilities employing approximately 100 people. In recent years, we have extended our reach internationally through our 2:1 employee Matching Gifts, as well as community giving programs in ten international locations. Since 1989, we have donated more than 173 million to communities where we live and work. In addition, our employees volunteered more than 113,000 hours through our Time N Talent and Dollars for Doers programs. 
 
 Principal Products and Uses 
 We are a diversified precision technology company that engineers, manufactures and markets differentiated products and systems used to dispense, apply and control adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, medical components, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces.

 Atrion Acquisition 
 On August 21, 2024, Nordson acquired Atrion Corporation, a Delaware corporation Atrion ), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ), dated as of May 28, 2024, among Nordson, Alpha Medical Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordson Merger Sub and Atrion. Headquartered in Allen, Texas, Atrion is a manufacturer of proprietary medical products and generated approximately 169 million in annual revenue in 2023. Established in 1944, Atrion supports customers globally through three FDA registered U.S. Food and Drug Administration manufacturing facilities located in the United States. Atrion s portfolio is included in the Company's Medical and Fluid Solutions segment. It consists of three key businesses that we believe will significantly expand Nordson s addressable market in infusion and cardiovascular therapies: 
 Halkey Roberts is a leader in infusion fluid delivery solutions, including single-use original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") medical components such as swabable needle free and pressure relief valves. 
 Atrion Medical is a leading provider of OEM interventional inflation devices for balloon catheterization, stent deployment and fluid delivery in structural heart, ears, nose and throat and gastrointestinal procedures.

Many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models. We have principal manufacturing operations and 
 Nordson Corporation 6

 sources of supply in the United States in Ohio, Georgia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Florida, Texas, Alabama and Wisconsin; as well as in the People s Republic of China, Germany, Ireland, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. 
 Principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics, typically in sheets, bar stock, castings, forgings, tubing and pellets. We also purchase many electrical and electronic components, fabricated metal parts, high-pressure fluid hoses, packings, seals and other items integral to our products. Suppliers are competitively selected based on cost, quality and service. Most significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources. We purchase most raw materials and other components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods. While these items are generally available from multiple sources, the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials and tariffs on certain raw materials, particularly imports from China, as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials, components and sourced finished goods. 
 We monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality, service, financial stability and price. We currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers, but our ongoing efforts to improve service and manage compliance requirements and the cost effectiveness of our products may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers. 
 Senior operating management supervises an extensive quality control program for our equipment, machinery and systems, and manufacturing processes. 
 Natural gas, electricity and other fuels are our primary energy sources. However, standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed. 
 We continue to see a stabilization of the global supply chain, improved lead times and lower inflation risk. We enhanced our risk mitigation and sourcing efforts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Logistics flows have improved, and global forwarding rates have returned closer to pre-pandemic levels, except for Asia-origin shipments, which continue to be more volatile. We continue to see moderate rate increases on parcel and domestic trucking activity. 
 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio is strengthened through innovation and brand recognition, and our comprehensive approach for protection and enforcement. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees that require them to disclose any inventions created in the scope of employment, convey all rights to those inventions to us and restrict the distribution of proprietary information. Risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 
 We protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our rights to sell our products both domestically and internationally. Although in the aggregate, our global portfolio of more than 2,100 granted and pending patents and more than 1,000 trademarks are valuable assets that are important to our operations, we believe that our competitive advantage is also largely attributable to the technical, marketing and sales competence and capabilities of our employees, rather than on any individual patent or trademark. Therefore, we do not consider the expiration or loss of any single patent, trademark or intellectual property right, to be material to our business as a whole. 
 
 Seasonal Variation in Business 
 Historically, the highest volume of sales occurs in the second half of the fiscal year due in large part to the timing of customers capital spending programs. Accordingly, fiscal first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers capital spending programs and customer holiday shutdowns. 
 
 Competitive Conditions 
 We operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large, well-established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers. Our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions, including industry capacity changes, global competition and economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding, sealing, finishing, coating, processing, testing, inspecting and fluid control techniques. Potential uses for our equipment include any production processes that require preparation, modification or curing of surfaces; dispensing, application, processing or control of fluids and materials; or testing and inspecting for quality. 
 
 Nordson Corporation 7 

Table of Contents 

 Many factors influence our competitive position, including pricing, product quality and service. We maintain a leadership position in our business segments by delivering high-quality, innovative products and technologies, as well as global service and technical support. Working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position. Our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage. 
 
 Compliance with Governmental Regulations 
 Our global operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and compliance obligations relating to the manufacturing, designing and servicing of highly complex products and solutions. Examples of such regulations include, but are not limited to, import and export controls, data privacy, environmental, product safety, corruption, bribery, employment and labor. To support our policy of compliance in every jurisdiction we do business, we have robust internal controls, quality management systems, and management systems of compliance that govern our internal actions and mitigate our risk of non-compliance. We also have safeguards established to identify non-compliance concerns through internal and external audits and risk assessments, as well as an ethics helpline reporting system. The following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business. For additional information about the risks associated with these laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 
 We transact with customers and suppliers in numerous geographies around the world and are required to comply with U.S. and non-U.S. import, export and sanctions laws (collectively Trade Laws ). We have developed compliance programs and training to prevent violations of Trade Laws, and we regularly monitor and adjust our programs and training to reflect changes in Trade Laws or changes in our business. Geopolitical events may result in changes to Trade Laws that may impact our ability to transact business involving certain countries, certain items or certain counterparties, or may impose additional costs or complexity relating to tariffs, taxes, duties or adjustments to our compliance programs, training, or personnel requirements. 
 We are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. The risk of data privacy breaches cannot be entirely eliminated, creating risks of fines and penalties. Additionally, privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"), and the interpretation and enforcement of these and similar laws and regulations, are continuously evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may develop and the costs and complexity of future compliance. 
 We are also subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental, safety and health laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land and water and the generation, handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Under certain of these laws, we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination. We are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses, many of which require periodic modification and renewal. The operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental, safety and health risks, and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate. 
 We believe that we operate in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses. We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain costs or legal claims related to environmental regulations, and we accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities. We believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings, liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliance-related costs and expenses may not arise in the future. For example, future adoption of new or amended environmental laws, regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances could require us to incur costs and expenses that may have a material effect, but cannot be presently anticipated. 
 We believe that policies, practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material regulation or compliance obligations arising from our operations. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign regulation and laws during 2024 had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Based upon consideration of currently available information, we believe liabilities for any such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or liquidity, but we cannot guarantee that material liabilities may not arise from regulation and compliance obligations in the future.

 Employee Profile 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had approximately 8,000 employees. 
 Total Rewards 
 As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, but also health, welfare and retirement benefits. We focus many programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including mental health support access, telemedicine and healthy weight loss programs. We believe that these solutions have helped us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population. 
 In the U.S., we match contributions to a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan (the Savings Plan for all eligible employees, in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar contributed by the employee until the employee contributions reach 6 of her or his base compensation. In addition, non-union new hires and re-hires as of July 1, 2021 are eligible for an additional enhanced 401(k) contribution of 3 eligible earnings. All contributions by employees into the Savings Plan are fully vested immediately. Company contributions, both the match and enhanced contribution, have a three-year graded vesting schedule and vest at 33 1/3 each year until fully vested after three years of employment. We also maintain a non-qualified, unfunded and unsecured deferred compensation plan for the benefit of eligible management. In addition, non-union employees hired prior to July 1, 2021 are eligible to participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the Salaried Pension Plan ). The Salaried Pension Plan is designed to work together with social security benefits to provide employees with up to 30 years of service retirement income replacement that is approximately 55 of eligible compensation, subject to the Internal Revenue Code maximum monthly benefit. Participants fully vest in the Salaried Pension Plan after five years of service. All eligible union employees hired prior to November 1, 2004 participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the Hourly Pension Plan ). The Hourly Pension Plan provides a multiplier for each year of service to supplement employees retirement income. We also maintain a supplemental retirement benefit restoration plan Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan ), which is an unfunded, non-qualified plan that is designed to provide retirement benefits to U.S.-based eligible officers hired prior to July 1, 2021, as a replacement for retirement benefits limited by regulations under the Internal Revenue Code. 
 In 2022, we launched a global recognition program that allows managers and peers to recognize the special achievements of others through both written recognition shared on a company awards feed, as well as monetary recognition that allows a recipient to choose a physical gift, gift card or donate the value of their recognition to charity. We also continue our service award program, which demonstrates appreciation and thanks to longstanding employees with five or more years of service. Service milestones are recognized at each five-year increment by presentation of a digital and/or printed certificate with an invitation to select a recognition award via an online catalog. 
 Talent 
 Our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, products and customers, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. Attracting and retaining the best talent relies on our ability to provide a diverse and inclusive workplace, personal and professional growth opportunities, and a rewarding employee experience. We strive to uphold a culture of shared knowledge, appreciation and success. We believe that our average tenure across the globe reflects our positive workplace culture and the strong engagement of our employees. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions. 
 Talent development and succession planning for critical roles is a cornerstone of our talent program. Development plans are created and monitored to ensure progress is made along the established timelines. Development plans also intersect with our mission, particularly as we strive to be responsible to our communities. 
 One of our core values Respect for People reflects the behavior we strive to include in every aspect of the way we conduct business. Our approach encompasses inclusion awareness and skill-building, intentionality with respect to diversity in our hiring and selection process and performance management and succession planning that recognizes the importance of diversity. Nordson s employee resource groups strengthen our commitment to fostering an inclusive, diverse workplace where everyone feels like they belong. Participation in these groups is open to all employees. We regularly reflect on our progress and explore opportunities to improve our inclusion and diversity programs, including at the executive leadership and Board levels.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In an enterprise as diverse as ours, a wide range of factors could affect future performance. We discuss in this section some of the risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, value and results of operations. You should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk factor has not already materialized. Additional risks factors may exist that are not presently known by the Company or that are currently deemed immaterial may also be present. 
 
 Risks Related to Economic Conditions 
 Changes in United States or international economic conditions, including declines in the industries we serve, could adversely affect the revenue stream and profitability of any of our operations. 
 In 2024, approximately 33 percent of our revenue was generated in the United States, while approximately 67 percent was generated outside the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic and related preventative and mitigation measures implemented by governments around the world and the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East have negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, and may continue to do so in future periods. 
 A general sustained slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry or an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading partners could negatively impact our business, financial condition or liquidity. Our largest markets include consumer non-durable, industrial, medical, electronics, consumer durable and automotive. A slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability. 
 A portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets, such as the electronics, polymer processing, agriculture, and metal finishing industries, which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions. The demand for our products depends, in part, on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers. Downward economic cycles in our customers industries or markets may reduce sales of some of our products. It is not possible to accurately predict the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future. 
 Any significant downturn in the health of the general economy, or any recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event or conditions, including inflationary pressures, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance, resulting in impairment of assets. We cannot predict the strength or duration of any economic slowdown and instability or the timing of any recovery. 
 Our financial results have been, and could continue to be, significantly impacted by uncertainty in U.S. trade policy, including uncertainty surrounding changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments. 
 Our ability to conduct business can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs, changes or repeals of trade agreements, including the impact of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement with Mexico and Canada, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, or the imposition of other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments. For example, the incoming U.S. presidential administration has proposed to significantly increase tariffs on foreign imports into the United States, particularly from Canada, China and Mexico. Other effects of these changes, including impacts on the price of raw materials, responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where we participate, could also have significant impacts on our financial results. We cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other governments, and any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East may have significant adverse effects on international trade policy.

 Significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results. 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the euro, the yen, the pound sterling and the Chinese yuan. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the United States dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. 
 A significant portion of our consolidated revenues in 2024 were generated in currencies other than the United States dollar, which is our reporting currency. We recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred. As a result, currency fluctuations between the United States dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and may continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation movements, which historically have been material and could continue to be material. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. We take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure, such as entering into hedging transactions, where applicable, but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. For example, the impact of conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, changes in monetary policies and the effects of the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union ("Brexit") have caused increased volatility in global currency exchange rates that have resulted in the strengthening of the United States dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. Future adverse consequences arising from the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East and Brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates. Any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations. We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into United States dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations diminish the United States dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and, if they occur or continue for significant periods, could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Operations 
 Political conditions in and between the United States and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business. 
 We conduct our manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business both within and outside the United States. We expect that international operations and United States export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future. Both sales from international operations and export sales are subject to varying degrees of risks inherent in doing business outside the United States. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 risks of political or economic instability; 
 unanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations; 
 threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, including the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East; 
 changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies, and other proposals to reform United States and foreign tax laws that impact how United States multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings; 
 restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country; 
 potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies; 
 the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances; 
 the imposition of tariffs, import or export licensing requirements and other potential changes in trade policies and relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the U.S. presidential administration; and 
 exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country. 
 Any of these events could reduce the demand for our products, limit the prices at which we can sell our products, interrupt our supply chain, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance. 
 Our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the U.S. and those foreign countries in which our customers, subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations. A protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other 
 Nordson Corporation 11 

Table of Contents 

 trade policies, may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. The incoming U.S. presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements, and while it remains unclear what actions the current or future administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements, or restrictions on trade generally, more stringent export and import controls may be ultimately imposed in the future. 
 Failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully. 
 Our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel, including factory production workers and other staff, to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace those who retire or resign. Failure to retain our leadership team and workforce and to attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives, possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which would likely harm our revenues, operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability. 
 The Company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes. 
 We regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies. We also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. The Company commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. If we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. 
 Increased information technology threats and cybersecurity incidents and threats could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services and those of our business partners. 
 We have experienced and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity threats and some cybersecurity incidents to our systems and networks. We do not believe that any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of past cybersecurity incidents, have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material adverse effect on the company, including our business, strategy, results of operations or financial condition. To conduct our business, we rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, some of which are managed, hosted and provided by third-party business partners. Increased global information technology security threats, computer crime and cyberterrorism pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity incidents and similar attacks vary in their form and can include the deployment of harmful malware or ransomware, denial-of-services attacks, and other attacks, which may affect business continuity and threaten the availability, confidentiality and integrity of our systems and information. Cybersecurity incidents can also include employee or personnel failures, fraud, phishing or other social engineering attempts or other methods to cause confidential information, payments, account access or access credentials, or other data to be transmitted to an unintended recipient. Cybersecurity threat actors also may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in software including software commonly used by companies in cloud-based services and bundled software. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. A cybersecurity incident or failure or disruption relating to our information or systems or that of our third-party business partners, or any failure by us or our third-party business partners to effectively address, enforce and maintain our information technology infrastructure and cybersecurity requirements may result in substantial harm to our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition, including major disruptions to business operations, loss of intellectual property, release of confidential information, alteration or corruption of data or systems, costs related to remediation or the payment of ransom, and litigation including individual claims or consumer class actions, commercial litigation, administrative, and civil or criminal investigations or actions, regulatory intervention and sanctions or fines, investigation and remediation costs and possible prolonged negative publicity. 
 We have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess, maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. The techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate 
 Nordson Corporation 12 

Table of Contents 

 these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. It is therefore possible that in the future we may suffer a criminal attack, unauthorized parties may gain access to personal information in our possession and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner. 
 The interpretation and application of data protection laws, including federal, state and international laws, relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere (including but not limited to the European Union s GDPR and the CCPA), are uncertain and evolving. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. In addition, as a result of existing or new data protection requirements, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information. These efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives. A breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations. 
 We may face particular data protection and privacy risks in connection with the European Union's Global Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and other privacy laws and regulations. 
 The interpretation and application of data protection laws and other regulations, including federal, state and international laws, relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personal information in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere (including but not limited to the European Union s GDPR and the CCPA), are uncertain and evolving. These laws and regulations may grant, among other things, individual rights to access and delete personal information, and the right to opt out of the sale of personal information. These laws and regulations can also impose significant forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance and afford private rights of action to individuals under certain circumstances. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. In addition, as a result of existing or new data protection laws and regulations, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our confidential or sensitive data and personal information. These efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives. A breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations. Any failure to manage data privacy in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in significant regulatory investigations, fines, and sanctions, consumer and class action litigation, commercial litigation, prolonged negative publicity, data breaches, declining customer confidence, loss of key customers, employee liability and other unfavorable consequences. 
 A disruption in, shortage of, or price increases for, supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers and changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels, including as a result of inflation or the imposition of tariffs, import or export licensing requirements and other potential changes in trade policies. The conflicts in Europe and the Middle East have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components. While we generally attempt to pass along higher raw material, part and component costs to our customers in the form of price increases, there historically has been a delay between an increase in our raw material costs and our ability to increase the prices of our products. Additionally, we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure and other factors. Shortages in raw materials or our inability to pass along price increases could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, demand surges, damaging weather or other acts of nature (including weather or other acts of nature caused by climate change), pandemics or other public health crises. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, impact our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees and others, result in lost or decreased sales, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 If our intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary. The steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, 
 Nordson Corporation 13 

Table of Contents 

 copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. The agreements may be breached or terminated, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and existing trade secrets, patent and copyright law afford us limited protection. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. Litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts. Further, we might not prevail in such litigation, which could harm our business. 
 Our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products. 
 Third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims, and we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined our products infringe. We may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party s intellectual property. We might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns. 
 Risks Related to the Execution of Our Strategy 
 We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. 
 A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive, as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities, and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. These efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 If we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, or our customers do not accept the new or enhanced products we develop, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. 
 Innovation is critical to our success. We believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions. We also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position. Difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new or enhanced products or failure to gain market acceptance of new or enhanced products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. We continue to invest in the development and marketing of new or enhanced products. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. If we fail to make innovations, launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. In addition, as new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers demands. 
 Our growth strategy includes acquisitions, and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully. 
 Our recent historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. For example, in August 2024, we completed our acquisition of Atrion. We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new 
 Nordson Corporation 14 

Table of Contents 

 markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. We cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, we cannot assure that any acquisition, including the recent acquisitions of Atrion, the ARAG Group ("ARAG") and CyberOptics Corporation ("CyberOptics"), once successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow. 
 The success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties, including: 
 our ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition and possible delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products; 
 diversion of management s time and attention from other business concerns; 
 difficulties in retaining key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired business; 
 difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout acquired companies; 
 adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers; 
 the risks associated with the assumption of product liabilities or contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets; and 
 the ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing. 
 In addition, an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of incurring acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition potential tax or other liabilities, acquisition expenses, the amortization of acquisition-acquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition. 
 We may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition, and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses. We could also incur significant costs, including, but not limited to, remediation costs, natural resources damages, civil or criminal fines and sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities, associated with environmental laws. 
 Any impairment in the value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization. 
 Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if market conditions for acquired businesses decline, if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist, if our stock price and market capitalization declines, or if future cash flow estimates decline, we could incur, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. In addition, any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value, the effect of which could be material. 
 Risks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters 
 Changes in United States and international tax laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our business, financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The U.S. federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. While we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items, such changes could affect our business and results of operations. 
 Nordson Corporation 15 

Table of Contents 

 We may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. 
 We are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the FCPA, UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage. The FCPA also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the SEC. Our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws, and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The level of returns on pension plan assets, changes in the actuarial assumptions used and management of pension liabilities could adversely affect us. 
 Our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon our various assumptions, including estimates of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates for future payment obligations, and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels. Our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions. Changes in assumptions, laws or regulations and how the Company manages pension liabilities could lead to variability in financial results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity. 
 Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements, and compliance with evolving environmental regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. 
 We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators, predecessors or third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. 
 Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. 
 It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations within and outside of the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations. We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be prohibited from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws or if we were to undertake environmental protection actions voluntarily. 
 Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance ("ESG") considerations expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm and other adverse effects on our business. 
 Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. We make statements about our ESG goals and initiatives through information provided on our website, press statements and other communications, including through our ESG Report. Responding to these ESG considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments and are impacted by factors that may be outside our control. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives and the focus of 
 Nordson Corporation 16 

Table of Contents 

 stakeholders may change and evolve over time. Stakeholders also may have very different views on where ESG focus should be placed, including differing views of regulators in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international ESG laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. 
 Risks Related to Our Capital Structure 
 Our inability to comply with the restrictive covenants included in the agreements governing our debt or to access additional sources of capital could impede our growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing debt. 
 The limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in the agreement governing our debt could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities. 
 The agreements governing our existing debt contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: 
 borrow money or guarantee the debts of others; 
 use assets as security in other transactions; 
 make restricted payments or distributions; and 
 sell or acquire assets or merge with or into other companies. 
 In addition, our credit facilities require us to meet certain financial ratios, including a Leverage Ratio and an Interest Coverage Ratio, both as defined in the credit facilities. 
 These restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities. 
 Our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of the agreements governing our debt will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. We may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities, including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants. If we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated, we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates. 
 We may need to obtain new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing debt. If we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions, we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing debt. Our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt. In addition, depending on market conditions and our financial performance, neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all. Finally, if financial market conditions worsen, our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized. 
 Changes in interest rates could adversely affect us. 
 Any period of interest rate increases may adversely affect our profitability. As of October 31, 2024, we had of total debt outstanding, of whic h 538,286 was p riced at interest rates that float with the market. As of October 31, 2024, a one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt would result in approximately 5,383 of additional annual interest expense. A higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 General Risk Factors 
 The insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures. 
 We maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail or deny our claims. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.

 Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control. 
 While we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities, severe weather conditions, including any that may be caused by global climate change, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, as well as major earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties, closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities, lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the supply of inventory, disruption in the transport of products and utilities, and delays in the delivery of products to our customers. Any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy 
 Nordson Corporation manages cybersecurity risks by implementing processes for assessment, identification, and mitigation of cybersecurity threats. Nordson's cybersecurity program is designed to align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") Cybersecurity Framework, enabling us to develop policies regarding information access, asset protection and personal data security. However, this does not mean that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications or requirements, but rather that we use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as a guide to help us identify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks and threats relevant to our business. We strive to protect our information assets through key cybersecurity measures, such as the implementation of multifactor authentication and advanced malware defenses, and we collaborate with internal stakeholders to establish layered cybersecurity defenses and restricted access based on business needs. We conduct regular continuous education sessions for our employees on cybersecurity awareness, including confidential information protection and simulated phishing attacks. 
 We engage with experts to assist with regular third-party penetration testing to evaluate our program against industry standards. We also have standing engagements with incident response experts and external counsel to enhance our cybersecurity resilience. We frequently collaborate with cybersecurity experts to share insights on threats, best practices and emerging trends. 
 Our cybersecurity risk management is a critical component of our comprehensive business continuity and enterprise risk management programs. Our information security team regularly collaborates with cross-functional subject matter experts and leaders to assess and enhance our cybersecurity risk posture and preparedness. Management employs the following defense mechanisms throughout the enterprise: employee training program to increase cybersecurity awareness, vulnerability management to identify and address potential weaknesses, multifactor authentication for secure access, tabletop exercises to simulate and prepare for potential incidents, and evaluation of third-party service providers, business partners and cloud suppliers, including through assessments of their cybersecurity practices prior to service utilization. 
 To date, management has not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Nordson Corporation, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors, Increased information technology threats and cybersecurity incidents and threats could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services and those of our business partners." above for more information. While we are committed to safeguarding our information and the proprietary and confidential information they contain, we note that no security measures can guarantee complete protection against cybersecurity incidents. 
 Governance 
 The Board of Directors, as a whole, has overarching responsibility for overseeing our strategic and operational risks. The Audit Committee specifically monitors risk management, including cybersecurity threats. Management, led by the Vice President, Information Systems and Technology, regularly reports to the Board of Directors, primarily through the Audit Committee, providing an annual report on specific risks, mitigation efforts, and a review of Nordson's cybersecurity maturity. 
 Management is responsible for day-to-day assessment and management of cybersecurity threats and risks. Nordson's Senior Director of Security and Compliance, primarily leads these efforts. The Vice President, Information Systems and Technology is responsible for oversight of Nordson's entire global IT operations, including the cybersecurity program and brings more than 25 years of experience and leadership across various information technology engineering, business and management roles, including direct oversight of strategic direction, program execution and operational excellence of technology initiatives.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management. 
 Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. On a regular basis, critical accounting policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the board of directors. 
 Revenue recognition - A contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied. Generally, our revenue results from short-term, fixed-price contracts and is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Company's revenue recognition policy. 
 Business combinations - The acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition, with the remainder, if any, recorded as goodwill. The fair values are determined by management, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities, and other relevant information. Such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts, which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values. The valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets, discounted to present value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, and asset lives, among other items. This judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets. The impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or depreciation expense. 
 Goodwill - Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or more often if indications of impairment exist. 
 We test goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2024. We use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values. To test for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the discounted cash flow method ("Income Approach") and the Market Approach. 
 The Income Approach uses assumptions for revenue growth, operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends. Terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the Gordon Growth Model Method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant Weighted Average Cost of Capital ("WACC") methodology and growth rate. For each reporting unit, a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment. Discount rates are developed using a WACC methodology. 
 The WACC represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors. For 2024, the WACC rates used ranged from 8.0 percent to 9.0 percent depending upon the reporting unit's size, end market volatility and projection risk. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the valuation methodologies used.

 In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the results of our annual impairment tests indicated no impairment. 
 The fair value ("FV") was compared to the carrying value ("CV") for each reporting unit. Based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of August 1, 2024, our conclusion is that no goodwill was impaired in 2024. Potential events or circumstances, such as a sustained downturn in global economies, could have a negative effect on estimated fair values. 
 WACC Excess of FV over CV Goodwill Industrial Precision Solutions Segment - Adhesives 8.0 330 1,183,342 Industrial Precision Solutions Segment - Industrial Coating Systems 9.0 3,451 24,083 Advanced Technology Solutions Segment - Electronics Systems 8.5 252 27,442 Advanced Technology Solutions Segment - Test Inspection 8.5 173 375,707 Medical and Fluid Solutions Segment - Fluid Management 8.5 170 1,175,199 
 Pension plan in the United States - The measurement of the liabilities related to our domestic pension plan is based on management s assumptions related to future factors, including interest rates, return on pension plan assets, compensation increases, mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates. The liabilities associated with the Company's international pension plans and OPEB are not as materially sensitive to changes in assumptions as the pension plan in the United States. 
 The weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 5.27 percent at October 31, 2024 and 6.08 percent at October 31, 2023. The discount rate used was determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled. 
 In determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions. The expected rate of return (long-term investment rate) on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 6.50 percent and 6.40 percent in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 3.96 percent and 3.92 percent at October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year. Differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years. 
 Economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. The effect of a one percent change in the discount rate, expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below. Bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances. We provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

 Management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income, allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount (including the valuation allowance), an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made. 
 Further, at each interim reporting period, we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year. Significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income. Additionally, interpretation of tax laws, court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates. As a result, our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities. Any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known. 
 Atrion Acquisition 
 On August 21, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Atrion, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement with Merger Sub and Atrion. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Atrion (the Merger ), with Atrion surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordson. Atrion is a leader in proprietary medical infusion fluid delivery and niche cardiovascular solutions and will operate within our Medical and Fluid Solutions segment. The all-cash acquisition of Atrion of 789,996, net of cash acquired, was funded using borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and the 364-day term loan agreement with a group of banks for a delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 500,000 (the "364-Day Term Loan Agreement") (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details) and cash on hand. Based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, a preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of 494,279 of goodwill and 129,600 of identifiable intangible assets. The identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of 40,100 of tradenames (amortized over 15 years), 24,900 of technology (amortized over 15 years), and 64,600 of customer relationships (amortized over 19 years). The financial results of the Atrion acquisition are not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Net Sales 
 Net sales for the Industrial precision solutions (IPS), Medical and Fluid Solutions (MFS) and Advanced technology solutions (ATS) segments were as follows: 
 Twelve Months Ended Variance - Increase (Decrease) Oct 31, 2024 of Total Oct 31, 2023 of Total Organic Acquisitions Currency Total IPS 1,484,249 55.2 1,391,046 52.9 0.1 6.6 6.7 MFS 695,452 25.9 660,316 25.1 (0.2) 5.4 0.1 5.3 ATS 510,220 19.0 577,270 22.0 (11.4) (0.2) (11.6) Total 2,689,921 2,628,632 (2.5) 4.8 2.3 
 The IPS organic sales increase of 0.1 percent was driven by increases in packaging, nonwovens, and industrial coatings product lines, principally offset by declines in measurements and controls and polymer processing. The MFS organic sales decrease of 0.2 was driven by a decrease in the medical fluid components product line, partially offset by an increase in the fluid solutions product line. The ATS organic sales decrease of 11.4 percent was driven by lower demand in electronics dispense product lines as well as test and inspection product lines. 
 Net Sales by region were as follows: 
 Twelve Months Ended Variance - Increase (Decrease) Oct 31, 2024 of Total Oct 31, 2023 of Total Organic Acquisitions Currency Total Americas 1,178,626 43.8 1,149,760 43.7 (1.9) 4.3 0.1 2.5 Europe 726,100 27.0 682,676 26.0 (5.1) 10.2 1.3 6.4 Asia Pacific 785,195 29.2 796,196 30.3 (1.0) 1.0 (1.4) (1.4) Total 2,689,921 2,628,632 (2.5) 4.8 2.3 
 Sales outside the United States accounted for 66.6 percent of total sales in 2024, as compared to 66.2 percent in 2023. 
 Operating Profit 
 Operating profit for the IPS, MFS and ATS segments were as follows: 
 Twelve Months Ended Oct 31, 2024 of Sales Oct 31, 2023 of Sales of Sales Change Increase (Decrease) IPS 470,559 31.7 460,889 33.1 (1.4) 9,670 2.1 MFS 187,731 27.0 189,367 28.7 (1.7) (1,636) (0.9) ATS 94,231 18.5 101,662 17.6 0.9 (7,431) (7.3) Corporate (78,520) (79,157) 637 (0.8) Total 674,001 25.1 672,761 25.6 (0.5) 1,240 0.2 
 Consolidated operating margin decreased by 50 basis points primarily driven by costs related to the first-year effect of acquisitions, which more than offset favorable product mix. Gross margins improved 1.0 percentage point reflecting the impact of favorable product mix and lower incremental inventory step-up amortization related to acquisitions of 7,703 in 2024 versus 8,862 in 2023, while the increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by acquisitions. IPS operating profit declined 140 basis points due to an unfavorable acquisition impact and severance costs. MFS operating margin declined 170 basis points due to 10,761 in fees, severance, and non-cash inventory charges associated with the Atrion acquisition which offset improvements in operating efficiencies. ATS operating margin improved by 90 basis points on lower sales volumes due to cost reduction actions and favorable mix. 
 Interest and Other expenses 
 Interest expense in 2024 was 88,924, an increase of 29,419, or 49.4 percent, from 2023 . The increase reflects higher average debt levels compared to the prior year due to funding of acquisitions. Other expense in 2024 was 4,509 compared to other expense of 597 in 2023 . Included in other expense in 2024 were 5,499 in net foreign currency losses, which were partially offset by pension gains. Included in the prior year s other expense were 7,742 in foreign currency losses, which were largely offset by pension gains.

 Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense in 2024 was 118,197, or 20.2 percent of pre-tax income, as compared to 127,846, or 20.8 percent of pre-tax income in 2023 . The effective tax rate decreased 60 basis points primarily due to a decline in the impact of foreign tax rate variances. The income tax provision for 2024 included a tax benefit of 4,037 due to our share-based payment transactions. Our income tax provision for 2023 included a tax benefit of 4,286 due to our share-based payment transactions. 
 Net Income 
 Net income was 467,284, or 8.11 per diluted share, in 2024, compared to net income of 487,493, or 8.46 per diluted share, in 2023. This represented a 4.1 percent decrease in net income and a 4.1 percent decrease in diluted earnings per share. The decrease of 0.35 per diluted share was primarily driven by higher interest expense in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased 273 in 2024 to 115,952 as of October 31, 2024 compared to 115,679 as of October 31, 2023. Approximately 81 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held at various foreign subsidiaries as of October 31, 2024. 
 A comparison of cash flow changes from 2024 to 2023 as follows: 
 Twelve Months Ended October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 Increase (Decrease) Net Income and non-cash items 609,342 615,496 (6,154) Changes in operating assets and liabilities (53,149) 25,786 (78,935) Net cash provided by operating activities 556,193 641,282 (85,089) Additions to property, plant and equipment (64,410) (34,583) (29,827) Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired (789,996) (1,422,780) 632,784 Other - net 10,008 20,484 (10,476) Net cash used in investing activities (844,398) (1,436,879) 592,481 Issuance of long-term debt 464,353 976,043 (511,690) Repayment of finance lease obligations (6,148) (6,840) 692 Dividends paid (161,438) (150,356) (11,082) Issuance of common shares 31,067 21,373 9,694 Purchase of treasury shares (33,339) (89,708) 56,369 Net cash provided by financing activities 294,495 750,512 (456,017) 
 The changes in operating assets and liabilities were principally driven by decreases in customer advance payments and income taxes payable. Additions to property, plant and equipment were largely driven by productivity and growth projects, including a new manufacturing facility. 
 We have a 1,150,000 unsecured multi-currency credit facility with a group of banks that provides for a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 300,000, maturing in June 2026, and a multicurrency revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of 850,000, maturing in June 2028.

 Our operating performance, balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2024 remained strong. The Company is well-positioned to manage liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements, capital expenditures and contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations, as well as principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. Primary sources of capital to meet these needs, as well as other opportunistic investments, are a combination of cash on hand, which was 115,952 as of October 31, 2024, cash provided by operations, which was 556,193 in 2024, and available borrowings under our loan agreements and unused bank lines of credit which totaled 785,880 as of October 31, 2024. Cash from operations, which when combined with our available borrowing capacity and ready access to capital markets, is expected to be more than adequate to fund our liquidity needs over the twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. The Company believes it has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its long-term needs for cash.

 We believe that the combination of present capital resources, cash from operations and unused financing sources such as our credit facilities, including our revolving credit facility, are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for the twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. There are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company. 
 
 New Accounting Standards 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . ASU 2023-07 requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and enhanced disclosures in interim periods. The guidance in ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures and anticipates adoption in 2025. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . ASU 2023-09 is intended to improve income tax disclosure requirements by requiring specific disclosure in the rate reconciliation and additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance in ASU 2023-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures and anticipates adoption in fiscal 2026. 
 In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement (Topic 220): Reporting Comprehensive Income. ASU 2024-03 does not change or remove current expense presentation requirements within the Consolidated Statements of Income. However, the amendments require disclosure, on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The amendments in this update are

 effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2024-03 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures and anticipates adoption in fiscal 2028. 
 
 Effects of Foreign Currency 
 The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices, sales volume, product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate. As a general rule, a weakening of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income, while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect. 
 In 2024, as compared with 2023, the United States dollar was slightly stronger against foreign currencies. If 2023 exchange rates had been in effect during 2024, sales would have been approximately 3,352 higher and third-party costs would have been approximately 903 higher. In 2023, as compared with 2022, the United States dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies. If 2022 exchange rates had been in effect during 2023, sales would have been approximately 23,153 higher and third-party costs would have been approximately 15,210 higher. These effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates. 
 
 Trends 
 Our solid historical performance is attributed to our diverse geographic and end market participation and our long-term commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers changing needs.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled. We regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions. These contracts, primarily associated with the euro, yen and pound sterling, typically have maturities of 90 days or less, and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for United States dollars at rates stated in the contracts. Gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains, respectively, on the underlying transactions. We use foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to help mitigate the risks related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 
 Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions. 
 A portion of our operations is financed with short-term and long-term borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates.

As of October 31, 2024, a one percent increase in interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately 5,383 on the variable rate long-term debt.

NOTE REGARDING AMOUNTS AND FISCAL YEAR REFERENCES 
 In this annual report, all amounts related to United States dollars and foreign currency and to the number of Nordson Corporation s common shares, except for per share earnings and dividend amounts, are expressed in thousands. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to we or the Company mean Nordson Corporation. 
 Unless otherwise noted, all references to years relate to our fiscal year.

 percent of our overall consolidated revenues for October 31, 2024 and 2023. 
 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring products or services. Taxes, including sales and value add, that we collect concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. As a practical expedient, we may exclude the assessment of whether goods or services are performance obligations, if they are immaterial in the context of the contract and combine these with other performance obligations. While payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, we have determined that our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. We have elected to apply the practical expedient to treat all shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs, as a significant portion of these costs are incurred prior to transfer of control to the customer. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as they are incurred, as the amortization period resulting from capitalizing the costs is one year or less. These costs are recorded within Selling and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 We offer assurance-type warranties on our products as well as separately sold warranty contracts. Revenue related to warranty contracts that are sold separately is recognized over the life of the warranty term and is not material. Certain arrangements may include installation, installation supervision, training and spare parts, which tend to be completed in a short period of time, at an insignificant cost, and utilizing skills not unique to us, therefore, these items are typically regarded as inconsequential or not material.

days or less and generally require us to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars at maturity, at rates stated in the contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in each accounting period in Other net on the Consolidated Statements of Income together with the transaction gain or loss from the related balance sheet position. The settlement of these contracts is recorded in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 We utilize net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment arising from re-measuring our investment in foreign subsidiaries. These hedges are included on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities (i.e., gains or losses) are recognized depending upon the type of hedging relationship and whether a hedge has been designated. For derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are used to hedge net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries, we designate the hedging instrument as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation with the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. The settlement of these hedges is recorded in investing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in current net earnings in "Other-net" on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 The Company has entered into treasury locks to fix the interest rate related to notes issued. The derivative positions are closed when the debt is priced with a cash settlement net payment that offsets changes in the benchmark treasury rate between execution of the treasury rate locks and the debt pricing date. The treasury locks are designed as cash flow hedges and the deferred amounts are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss) ("AOCI") and subsequently reclassed to interest expense as payments are made on the notes through the maturity date.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement (Topic 220): Reporting Comprehensive Income. ASU 2024-03 does not change or remove current expense presentation requirements within the Consolidated Statements of Income. However, the amendments require disclosure, on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2024-03 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures and anticipates adoption in fiscal 2028.

The settlement resulted in a loss of , whic h is included in Pension settlement charge for U.S. Plans on the Consolidated Statements of Income. This transaction relieved the Company of its responsibility for the pension obligation related to certain retired employees and transferred the obligation and payment responsibility to Prudential for retirement benefits owed to approximately retirees and other beneficiaries. The annuity contract covered retirees who commenced receiving benefits on or before November 1, 2021. The monthly retirement benefit payment amounts currently received by retirees and their beneficiaries did not change as a result of this transaction. Plan participants not included in the transaction remain in the plans and responsibility for payment of the retirement benefits remains with the Company.

Rate of compensation increase Assumptions used to determine net benefit costs for the years ended October 31: Discount rate - benefit obligation Discount rate - service cost Discount rate - interest cost Expected return on plan assets Rate of compensation increase 
 The amortization of prior service cost is determined using a straight-line amortization of the cost over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. 
 The discount rate reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The discount rate used considers a yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available bonds that receive the highest rating given from a recognized investments ratings agency. The changes in the discount rates in 2024, 2023 and 2022 are due to changes in yields for these types of investments as a result of the economic environment. 
 In determining the expected return on plan assets using the calculated value of plan assets, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return assumptions. The rate of compensation increase is based on management s estimates using historical experience and expected increases in rates. 
 The international plans include a cash balance plan with promised interest crediting rates. The weighted average crediting rates were , and for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Gains or losses within the corridor remain in other comprehensive income and are retested in subsequent measurements. Gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over an average employee future service period that differs by plan. If substantially all of the plan s participants are no longer actively accruing benefits, the average life expectancy is used.

 Our investment objective for defined benefit plan assets is to meet the plans benefit obligations, while minimizing the potential for future required plan contributions.

percent of the Company's worldwide pension assets. In general, the investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments, and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by dynamically matching the actuarial projections of the plans future liabilities and benefit payments with expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. For 2024, the target in return-seeking assets is percent and percent in longer duration fixed income assets. Plan assets are diversified across multiple investment managers and are invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and continual monitoring of investment managers performance relative to the guidelines established with each investment manager. 
 Our international plans comprise percent of the Company's worldwide pension assets. Asset allocations are developed on a country-specific basis. Our investment strategy is to cover pension obligations with insurance contracts or to employ independent managers to invest the assets.

 These investment funds did not own a significant number of Nordson Corporation common shares for any year presented. 
 The inputs and methodology used to measure fair value of plan assets are consistent with those described in Note 10. Following are the valuation methodologies used to measure these assets: 
 Money market funds - Money market funds are public investment vehicles that are valued with a net asset value of one dollar. This value is a quoted price in an active market and is classified as Level 1. 
 Equity securities - Common stocks and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and are classified as Level 1. 
 Fixed income securities - U.S. government securities are valued using bid evaluations and are classified as Level 2. Corporate fixed income securities are valued using evaluated prices, such as dealer quotes, bids and offers and are therefore classified as Level 2. 
 Insurance contracts - Insurance contracts are investments with various insurance companies. The contract value represents the best estimate of fair value. These contracts do not hold any specific assets. These investments are classified as Level 3. 
 Real estate collective funds These funds are valued using the net asset value of the underlying properties. Net asset value is calculated using a combination of key inputs, such as revenue and expense growth rates, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates. 
 Pooled investment funds - These are public investment vehicles valued using the net asset value. The net asset value is based on the value of the assets owned by the plan, less liabilities. These investments are not quoted on an active exchange.

For eligible retirees under the age of who enroll in the plan, the plan is contributory in nature, with retiree contributions in the form of premiums that are adjusted annually. For eligible retirees age and older who enroll in the plan, the plan delivers a benefit in the form of a Health Reimbursement Account ("HRA"), which retirees use for eligible reimbursable expenses, including premiums paid for purchase of a Medicare supplement plan or other out-of-pocket medical expenses such as deductibles or co-pays.

 The weighted average health care trend rates reflect expected increases in the Company s portion of the obligation. The decrease in the health care cost trend rates in 2024 for the U.S. postretirement plan is due to a reduction in the long-term increase assumption for the HRA benefit.

 Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently invested in their operations. These undistributed earnings represent the post-income tax earnings under U.S. GAAP not adjusted for previously taxed income which aggregated approximately and at October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Should these earnings be distributed, applicable foreign tax credits, distributions of previously taxed income and utilization of other attributes would substantially offset taxes due upon the distribution. It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on these basis differences because of the multiple methods by which these differences could reverse and the impact of withholding, U.S. state and local taxes and currency translation considerations.

 We are subject to United States Federal income tax as well as income taxes in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination in the U.S. by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for the years 2021 through 2024; years prior to 2021 year are closed to further examination by the IRS. Generally, major state and foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination for years after 2018. Within the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that certain statute of limitations periods would expire, which could result in a minimal decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits.

The net change in the valuation allowance was an increase of in 2024 and an increase of in 2023. The valuation allowance of at October 31, 2024, related primarily to tax credits and loss carryforwards that may expire before being realized. We continue to assess the need for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets based on determinations of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized.

 Revolving credit agreement In April 2019, we entered into a unsecured multi-currency credit facility with a group of banks, which amended, restated and extended our then existing syndicated revolving credit agreement. This facility had a five-year term expiring in April 2024 and included a sub-facility for swing-line loans.

 Treasury Locks 
 During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into treasury locks to fix the interest rate related to of the of 2029 Notes issued on September 4, 2024. The derivative positions were closed when the debt was priced on September 4, 2024 with a cash settlement net payment of that offset changes in the benchmark treasury rate between execution of the treasury rate locks and the debt pricing date. These derivatives were designed as cash flow hedges and the deferred amount reported in AOCI is being reclassed to interest expense as payments are made on the notes through the maturity date. 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 Net assets of our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We may utilize net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment arising from re-measuring our investment in foreign subsidiaries. 
 During 2024, the Company was party to various cross currency swaps between the U.S. Dollar and Euro, Japanese Yen, Taiwan Dollar, Singapore Dollar and Chinese Yuan, which were designated as hedges of our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. Any increases or decreases related to the remeasurement of the hedges are recorded in the currency translation component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying investments. A net gain of , net of tax of , was recorded in 2024 related to all net investment hedges, which is included in foreign currency translation adjustments in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.

The liability for environmental remediation represents management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations. The accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities, the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations, and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements. Consequently, our liability could be greater than our current estimate. However, we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Nordson Corporation 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Nordson Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Nordson Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. 
 As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Atrion Corporation and its subsidiaries (Atrion), which is included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constitu ted 14 of total assets as of October 31, 2024 and 1 of total revenues for the year then ended. Net income for the year then ended did not have a material impact on the Company s operations. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Atrion. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2024, and the related notes and schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated December 18, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Nordson Corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nordson Corporation (the Company) as of October 31, 2024 and 2023 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2024 , and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 31, 2024 and 2023 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2024 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated December 18, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

 Valuation of Goodwill Description of the Matter At October 31, 2024, the Company had 3,280,819 thousand of goodwill. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment annually as of August 1, and between annual evaluations if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of those assets. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test for all reporting units in fiscal 2024. As part of the quantitative impairment tests, the Company estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach, and the guideline public company method, a form of the market approach. 
 Auditing management s annual goodwill impairment assessment relating to goodwill was complex due to the use of valuation methodologies in the determination of the estimated fair values of the reporting units. These fair value estimates are impacted by assumptions such as discount rates, revenue growth rates, and operating margins which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s goodwill impairment process whereby the Company develops assumptions that are used as inputs to the annual goodwill impairment tests. This included controls over management's review of the valuation models and the assumptions, described above. 
 To test the implied fair value of the Company s reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the valuation methodologies, testing the assumptions, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We involved our internal valuation specialists in assessing the fair value methodologies applied and evaluating the reasonableness of certain assumptions selected by management. We assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We tested management s reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. We also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

 Penalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information can be severe both for individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers and supervisors, and may include jail terms, criminal fines, civil penalties, and civil enforcement injunctions.

 Tipping Penalties A person who tips others may also be liable for transactions by the tippees to whom he or she has disclosed material nonpublic information. Tippers can be subject to the same legal penalties and sanctions as the tippees. 
 Company and Manager Penalties The SEC can also seek substantial civil penalties from any person who, at the time of an insider trading violation, directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed such violation, which would apply to the Company and or management and supervisory personnel.

Exhibit 19 

Every officer, director, and other employee has the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy, and the applicable laws of their jurisdiction. In all cases, the ultimate responsibility for adhering to this Policy and avoiding improper trading rests with you, and any action on the part of the Company, the Compliance Officers or any other employee or director pursuant to this Policy (or otherwise) does not in any way constitute legal advice or insulate you from liability under applicable securities laws. 
 EXCEPTIONS

The Company will re-open the PTP at the beginning of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of the information, or at such time as the information is no longer material.

 Pre-clearance of Securities Transactions 
 The Company requires all Directors and executive officers, prior to trading, to clear all transactions in the Company s securities, even during a PTP or trading window. 
 Directors and executive officers may not, directly or indirectly, purchase or sell (or otherwise make any transfer or gift) any Company security at any time without first obtaining prior approval from first, the General Counsel or, if he or she is unavailable, the Chief Financial Officer. These procedures also apply to transactions by such person's spouse, immediate family members, household members and family members whose transactions involving Nordson securities are directed by a Director or executive officer or are subject to their influence or control . 
 The General Counsel or Chief Financial Officer shall record the date each request is received and the date and time each request is approved or disapproved. Unless revoked or otherwise stated, a grant of permission will normally remain valid until the close of trading two business days following the day on which it was granted. If 

Exhibit 19 

the transaction does not occur during the two-day period, pre-clearance of the transaction must be re- requested. 
 Pre-clearance is not required for purchases and sales of securities under a previously Approved 10b5-1 Plan. However, directors and executive officers must instruct his or her third party who is effecting transactions, pursuant to any purchase or sale under an Approved 10b5-1 Plan, to send duplicate confirmations of all such transactions to the Compliance Officer.
