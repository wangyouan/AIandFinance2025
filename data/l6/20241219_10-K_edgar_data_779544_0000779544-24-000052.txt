PART I 
 
 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 On one or more occasions, we may make statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our assumptions, projections, expectations, targets, intentions or beliefs about future events. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated by reference herein relating to management s current expectations of future financial performance, continued growth and changes in economic conditions or capital markets are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 Words or phrases such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, plans, predicts, projects, targets, will likely result, hopes, will continue or similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed. We caution that while we make such statements in good faith and we believe such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, including without limitation, management s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in records and other data available from third parties, we cannot assure you that our projections will be achieved. Factors that may cause such differences include: economic conditions generally and in each of the markets in which we are located, the amount of sales contributed by new and existing restaurants, labor costs for our personnel, fluctuations in the cost of food products, adverse weather conditions, changes in consumer preferences and the level of competition from existing or new competitors. We have attempted to identify, in context, certain factors that we believe may cause actual future experience and results to differ materially from our current expectation regarding the relevant matter or subject area. 
 While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this report in the context of the factors that could cause outcomes to differ materially from our expectations. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
 the adverse impact of the current political climate and current and future economic conditions, including inflation, on our: (i) operating results, cash flows and financial condition, (ii) ability to comply with the terms and covenants of our debt agreements, (iii) ability to pay or refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional financing, and (iv) projected cash flows used in assessing assets for impairment; 
 increases in food, beverage and supply costs, especially for seafood, shellfish, chicken and beef; 
 increases in wages and benefit costs, including the cost of group medical insurance; 
 our ability to open new restaurants in new and existing markets, including difficulty in finding sites and in negotiating acceptable leases; 
 our ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates and complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms; 
 vulnerability to changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions; 
 vulnerability to conditions in the cities in which we operate; 
 vulnerability to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters given the geographic concentration and real estate intensive nature of our business; 
 our ability to extend existing leases on favorable terms, if at all, including our Bryant Park Grill Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park leases which both expire on April 30, 2025; 
 negative publicity, whether or not valid, and our ability to respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media; 
 risks associated with food safety and quality and food-borne illnesses; 
 the reliance of the Company on the continued service of its executive officers; 
 the impact of any security breaches of confidential customer information in connection with our electronic process of credit and debit card transactions; and 
 3 

the impact of any failure of our information technology system or any breach of our network security. 
 
 We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences we anticipate or affect us or our operations in the ways that we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 
 
 From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements are also included in our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, our Schedule 14A, our press releases and other materials released to the public. Although we believe that at the time made, the expectations reflected in all of these forward-looking statements are and will be reasonable; any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our reports on Forms 10-Q, and 8-K, our Schedule 14A and any other public statements that are made by us may prove to be incorrect. This may occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain of which are beyond our control, will be important in determining our future performance. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from forward-looking statements. In light of these and other uncertainties, you should not regard the inclusion of a forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or other public communications that we might make as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved, and you should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 
 We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, your attention is directed to any further disclosures made on related subjects in our subsequent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-Q and 8-K and Schedule 14A. 
 Unless the context requires otherwise, references to we, us, our, ARKR and the Company refer specifically to Ark Restaurants Corp. and its subsidiaries, partnerships, variable interest entities and predecessor entities.

Item 1. Business 
 Overview 
 We are a New York corporation formed in 1983. As of the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, we owned and/or operated 17 restaurants and bars, 16 fast food concepts and catering operations through our subsidiaries. Four of our restaurant and bar facilities are located in New York City, one is located in Washington, D.C., five are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, one is located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, four are located on the east coast of Florida and two are located on the Gulf Coast of Alabama. 
 Our restaurants are typically larger, destination properties intended to benefit from high patron traffic attributable to the uniqueness of the location and catered events. All of our expansion in recent years has been through acquisitions as follows: The Rustic Inn in Dania Beach, Florida (2014); Shuckers in Jensen Beach, Florida (2016); two Original Oyster Houses , one in Gulf Shores, Alabama and one in Spanish Fort, Alabama (2017), JB's on the Beach in Deerfield Beach, Florida (2019), and Blue Moon Fish Company (2021) in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida. 
 The names and themes of each of our restaurants are different except for our two Broadway Burger Bar and Grill restaurants and two Original Oyster House restaurants. The menus in our restaurants are extensive, offering a wide variety of high-quality foods at generally moderate prices. The atmosphere at many of the restaurants is lively and extremely casual. Most of the restaurants have separate bar areas, are open seven days a week and most serve lunch as well as dinner. A majority of our net sales are derived from dinner as opposed to lunch service. 
 While decor differs from restaurant to restaurant, interiors are marked by distinctive architectural and design elements which often incorporate dramatic interior open spaces and extensive glass exteriors. The wall treatments, lighting and decorations are typically vivid, unusual and, in some cases, highly theatrical.

Leases 
 We are not currently committed to any significant development projects, except for the refresh obligations in connection with the New York-New York Hotel and Casino lease renewals discussed below; however, we may take advantage of opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors. 
 Restaurant Expansion and Other Developments 
 On April 8, 2022, the Company extended its lease for Gallagher's Steakhouse at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2032. In connection with the extension, the Company agreed to spend a minimum of 1,500,000 to materially refresh the premises by April 30, 2023 (as extended from September 30, 2022 due to supply chain issues). Accordingly, the property was substantially closed for renovation on February 5, 2023 and reopened on April 28, 2023. The total cost of the refresh was approximately 1,900,000. 
 On June 24, 2022, the Company extended its lease for America at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2033. In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of 4,000,000 to materially refresh the premises by December 31, 2025 (as extended from December 31, 2024), subject to various extensions as set out in the agreement. To date approximately 100,000 has been spent on this refresh. 
 
 On July 21, 2022, the Company extended its lease for the Village Eateries at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2034. As part of this extension, the Broadway Burger Bar and Grill and Gonzalez y Gonzalez , were carved out of the Village Eateries footprint and the extended date for those two locations is December 31, 2033. In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of 3,500,000 to materially refresh all three of these premises by December 31, 2025 (as extended from June 30, 2023), subject to various extensions as set out in the agreement. To date approximately 950,000 has been spent on this refresh. 
 
 Each of the above refresh obligations are to be consistent with designs approved by the landlord which shall not be unreasonably withheld. We have and will continue to pay all rent as required by the leases without abatement during construction. Note that our substantial completion of work set forth in plans approved by the landlord shall constitute our compliance with the requirements of the completion deadlines, regardless of whether or not the amount actually expended in connection therewith is less than the minimum. 
 Our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity. 
 We may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors. 
 Recent Restaurant Dispositions 
 The Company advised the landlord of El Rio Grande (a consolidated VIE) we would be terminating the lease and closing the property permanently on or around January 1, 2025. In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a loss of 876,000 during the year ended September 28, 2024 consisting of: (i) rent and other costs incurred in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease in the amount of 398,000, (ii) accrued severance and other costs in the amount of 94,000, (iii) an impairment charge related to long-lived assets in the amount of 269,000 and (iv) the write-off of our security deposit in the amount of 238,000, all partially offset by a gain related to the write-off of right-of-use ("ROU") assets and related lease liabilities in the net amount of 123,000. 
 Investment in New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC 
 On March 12, 2013, the Company made a 4,200,000 investment in the New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC NMR through its purchase of a membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, an existing member of NMR with a then 63.7 ownership interest. On November 19, 2013, the Company invested an additional 464,000 in NMR through a purchase of an additional membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC resulting in a total ownership of 11.6 of Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, and an effective ownership interest in NMR of 7.4 , subject to dilution. In 2015, the Company invested an additional 222,000 in NMR and on February 7, 2017, the Company invested an additional 222,000 in NMR, both as a result of capital calls, bringing its total investment to 5,108,000 with no change in ownership. The Company accounts for this investment at cost, less 
 8 

impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-01. There are no observable prices for this investment. 
 During the years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company received distributions from NMR in the amounts of 26,000 and 52,000, respectively, which are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations for the years then ended. 
 In addition to the Company s ownership interest in NMR, if casino gaming is approved at the Meadowlands and NMR is granted the right to conduct said gaming, the Company shall be granted the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in the gaming facility with the exception of one restaurant. 
 In conjunction with this investment, the Company, through a 97 owned subsidiary, Ark Meadowlands LLC AM VIE ), also entered into a long-term agreement with NMR for the exclusive right to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities (the Racing F B Concessions located in the new raceway grandstand constructed at the Meadowlands Racetrack in northern New Jersey. Under the agreement, NMR is responsible to pay for the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Racing F B Concessions, and all revenues and profits thereof inure to the benefit of NMR. AM VIE receives an annual fee equal to 5 of the net profits received by NMR from the Racing F B Concessions during each calendar year. AM VIE is a variable interest entity; however, based on qualitative consideration of the contracts with AM VIE, the operating structure of AM VIE, the Company s role with AM VIE, and that the Company is not obligated to absorb expected losses of AM VIE, the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary and not required to consolidate the operations of AM VIE. 
 On April 25, 2014, the Company loaned 1,500,000 to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC. The note bears interest at 3 , compounded monthly and added to the principal, and is due in its entirety on June 30, 2029. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium. The principal and accrued interest related to this note in the amounts of 1,442,000 and 1,399,000, are included in Investment In and Receivable From New Meadowlands Racetrack in the consolidated balance sheets at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Restaurant Management 
 Each restaurant is managed by its own manager and has its own chef. Food products and other supplies are purchased primarily from various unaffiliated suppliers, in most cases by our headquarters' personnel. Each of our restaurants has two or more assistant managers and sous chefs (assistant chefs). Financial and management control is maintained at the corporate level through the use of automated systems that include centralized accounting and reporting. 
 Purchasing and Distribution 
 We strive to obtain quality menu ingredients, raw materials and other supplies and services for our operations from reliable sources at competitive prices. Substantially all menu items are prepared on each restaurant s premises daily from scratch, using fresh ingredients. Each restaurant s management determines the quantities of food and supplies required and then orders the items from local, regional and national suppliers on terms negotiated by our centralized purchasing staff. Restaurant-level inventories are maintained at a minimum dollar-value level in relation to sales due to the relatively rapid turnover of the perishable produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy commodities that are used in operations. 
 We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term supply agreements depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we do not contract for long periods of time for our fresh commodities such as produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy items and, consequently, such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations. Independent food service distributors deliver most food and supply items daily to restaurants. The financial impact of the termination of any such supply agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We believe that we have established stable long-term relationships with several key suppliers, particularly with respect to crabs and other shellfish. 
 Competition 
 The hospitality industry is highly competitive and is often affected by changes in taste and entertainment trends among the public, by local, national and economic conditions affecting spending habits, and by population and traffic patterns. We believe that the principal means of competition among restaurants include the location, type and quality of facilities and the type, quality and price of beverage and food served. 
 Our restaurants compete directly or indirectly with many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned, some with substantially greater financial resources than we have. Their resources and market presence may provide advantages in 
 9 

marketing, purchasing and negotiating leases. We compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for sites and finding management personnel. 
 Employees 
 At November 30, 2024, we employed 1,862 persons (including employees at managed facilities), 1,246 of whom were full-time employees, and 616 of whom were part-time employees; 36 of whom were headquarters personnel, 147 of whom were restaurant management personnel, 733 of whom were kitchen personnel and 678 of whom were restaurant service personnel. A number of our restaurant service personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Changes in minimum wage levels may adversely affect our labor costs and the restaurant industry generally because a large percentage of restaurant personnel are paid at or slightly above the minimum wage. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. 
 In the past, we have experienced aggressive competition for talent, wage inflation and pressure to improve workplace conditions and benefits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and various other economic factors. Our compensation packages may prove insufficient to attract and retain the best personnel in light of the challenges posed by the pandemic and wage pressures resulting from the labor shortage. Higher employee turnover levels or our failure to recruit and retain new restaurant employees in a timely manner could impact our ability to grow sales at existing restaurants or open new restaurants and also result in higher than projected labor costs. 
 Trademarks and Service Marks 
 We regard our trademarks and other service marks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and trademarks and to vigorously oppose any infringement of them. Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, we expect that the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely. 
 Government Regulation 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities that may include alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, environmental, zoning and public safety agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining or failures to obtain the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development and openings of new restaurants, or could disrupt the operations of existing restaurants. 
 Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for licenses and permits to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary suspension or revocation for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum ages of patrons and employees consuming or serving such beverages; employee alcoholic beverages training and certification requirements; hours of operation; advertising; wholesale purchasing and inventory control of such beverages; seating of minors and the service of food within our bar areas; and the storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. State and local authorities in many jurisdictions routinely monitor compliance with alcoholic beverage laws. The failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license for a particular restaurant could adversely affect our ability to obtain such licenses in jurisdictions where the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license occurred. 
 We are subject to dram-shop statutes in most of the states in which we have operations, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance. A settlement or judgment against us under a dram-shop statute in excess of liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 Various federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationship with employees, including such matters as minimum wages, breaks, overtime, fringe benefits, safety, working conditions and citizenship requirements. We are also subject to the regulations of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If our employees do not meet federal citizenship or residency requirements, their deportation could lead to a disruption in our work force. Significant government-imposed increases in minimum wages, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits, or increased tax reporting, assessment or payment requirements related to employees who receive gratuities could be detrimental to our profitability. 
 Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ADA and related state statutes. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and 
 10 

employment. Under the ADA and related state laws, when constructing new restaurants or undertaking significant remodeling of existing restaurants, we must make them more readily accessible to disabled persons. 
 
 We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. During fiscal 2024, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated. 
 Seasonal Nature of Business 
 Our business is highly seasonal; however, our broader geographical reach as a result of recent acquisitions is expected to continue to mitigate some of the risk. For instance, the second quarter of our fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather season in New York and Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest performing quarter; however, in recent years this has been partially offset by our locations in Florida as they experience increased results in the winter months. We achieve our best results during the warmer weather, attributable to our extensive outdoor dining availability, particularly at Bryant Park in New York and Sequoia in Washington, D.C. (our largest restaurants) and our outdoor cafes. However, even during summer months these facilities can be adversely affected by unusually cool or rainy weather conditions. Our facilities in Las Vegas are indoor and generally operate on a more consistent basis throughout the year, although in recent years the summer months have seen lower traffic.

 Item 1A . Risk Factors 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 1B . Unresolved Staff Comments 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 1C . Cybersecurity 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 
 We have established policies and processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, and have integrated these processes into our overall risk management systems and processes. Management, with the assistance of third party service providers, routinely assesses material risks from cybersecurity threats, including any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through our information systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems or any information residing therein. 
 
 We design and assess our program based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") Cybersecurity Framework ("CSF"). This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, but that we use the NIST framework as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business. 
 
 11 

We conduct risk assessments at least annually to identify cybersecurity threats based on the NIST CSF. These risk assessments include identifying reasonably foreseeable potential internal and external risks, the likelihood of occurrence and any potential damage that could result from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, systems, controls and other safeguards we have put in place to manage such risks. Our risk management process also encompasses cybersecurity risks associated with the use of our major third-party vendors and service providers. 
 
 Following these risk assessments, we design, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards to minimize the identified risks; reasonably address any identified gaps in existing safeguards; update existing safeguards as necessary; and monitor the effectiveness of our safeguards. 
 
 While cybersecurity threats have not materially affected our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, future incidents may interrupt our operations and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Governance 
 
 Our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO ), Chief Financial Officer CFO and Co-Chief Operating Officers, are responsible for identifying and assessing cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes designed to provide reasonable assurance that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, instituting appropriate mitigation and remediation measures, and maintaining cybersecurity programs. Our cybersecurity program is led by our CFO who has experience in cybersecurity risk management from both a practical and management standpoint and utilizes third-party consulting firms on a regular basis to assist with risk mitigation, incident response and overall maintenance of our cybersecurity program. 
 
 The Board of Directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its overall risk oversight function. The Board of Directors receives updates from the CFO regarding the Company s cybersecurity risk management program at least annually. These include updates on the Company s cybersecurity risks and threats, the status of projects to strengthen the information security systems, assessments of the information security program, and the emerging cybersecurity threat landscape. 
 
 Item 2. Properties 
 Our restaurant facilities and our executive offices, with the exception of The Rustic Inn in Dania Beach, Florida, Shuckers in Jensen Beach, Florida and the two Original Oyster House properties in Alabama, are occupied under leases. Most of our restaurant leases provide for the payment of base rents plus real estate taxes, insurance and other expenses and, in certain instances, for the payment of a percentage of our sales at such facility. As of September 28, 2024, these leases (including leases for managed restaurants) have terms (including any available renewal options) expiring as follows: 
 Fiscal Year Lease 
 Terms Expire

 Facilities 
 2024-2027 4 2028-2032 3 2033-2037 8 2038-2042 2043-2047 3 
 Our executive, administrative and clerical offices are located in approximately 8,500 square feet of office space at 85 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York. Our lease for this office space expires in 2038. 
 For information concerning our future lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we are a party to various lawsuits arising from accidents at our restaurants and workers compensation claims, which are generally handled by our insurance carriers. 
 Our employment of management personnel, waiters, waitresses and kitchen staff at a number of different restaurants has resulted in the institution, from time to time, of litigation alleging violation by us of employment discrimination laws. We do not believe that any of such suits will have a material adverse effect upon us, our financial condition or operations. 
 The Company is not subject to pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary claims incidental to its business, which the Company does not believe will materially impact results of operations.

 Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans 
 Prior to fiscal 2022, the Company had options outstanding under two stock option plans: the 2010 Stock Option Plan (the 2010 Plan and the 2016 Stock Option Plan (the 2016 Plan ). Options granted under both plans are exercisable at prices at least equal to the fair market value of such stock on the dates the options were granted and expire ten years after the date of grant. 
 On March 15, 2022, the shareholders of the Company approved the Ark Restaurants Corp. 2022 Stock Option Plan (the "2022 Plan"). Effective with this approval, the Company terminated the 2016 Plan along with the 63,750 authorized but unissued options under the 2016 Plan. Such termination did not affect any of the options previously issued and outstanding under the 2016 Plan, which remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. Under the 2022 Plan, 500,000 options were authorized for future grant and are exercisable at prices at least equal to the fair market value of such stock on the dates the options were granted. The options expire ten years after the date of grant. 
 On January 18, 2024, options to purchase 107,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 14.80 per share were granted to officers and directors of the Company under the 2022 Plan. Such options are exercisable as to 25 of the shares commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant and as to an additional 25 on each yearly anniversary thereafter. The grant date fair value of these stock options was 4.39 per share and totaled approximately 472,000. 
 
 During the year ended September 28, 2023, no options to purchase shares of common stock were issued by the Company.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosure 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this annual report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this annual report. Please see the discussion of forward-looking statements at the beginning of this annual report under "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements". 
 Inflation 
 Beginning in 2021, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events, causing supply chain challenges and significantly increased commodity and wage inflation. While we have seen improvements in many of these areas, some of these factors continued to impact our operating results in fiscal 2024. The ongoing impact of these events could lead to further shifts in consumer behavior, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product and services cost inflation, disruptions in our supply chain and delays in opening and acquiring new restaurants. If these factors significantly impact our cash flow in the future, we may again implement mitigation actions such as continued suspension of dividends, increasing borrowings or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our business, including possible impairments of assets. 
 Overview 
 As of September 28, 2024, the Company owned and operated 17 restaurants and bars, 16 fast food concepts and catering operations, exclusively in the United States, that have similar economic characteristics, nature of products and service, class of customer and distribution methods. The Company believes it meets the criteria for aggregating its operating segments into a single reporting segment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. 

15 

Accounting Period 
 Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest September 30. We report fiscal years under a 52/53-week format. This reporting method is used by many companies in the hospitality industry and is meant to improve year-to-year comparisons of operating results. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 both included 52 weeks. 
 Seasonality 
 The Company has substantial fixed costs that do not decline proportionally with sales. Although our business is highly seasonal, our broader geographical reach as a result of prior acquisitions is expected to continue to mitigate some of the risk. For instance, the second quarter of our fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather season in New York and Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest performing quarter; however, in recent years this has been partially offset by our locations in Florida as they experience increased results in the winter months. We generally achieve our best results during the warmer weather, attributable to our extensive outdoor dining availability, particularly at Bryant Park in New York and Sequoia in Washington, D.C. (our largest restaurants) and our outdoor cafes. However, even during summer months these facilities can be adversely affected by unusually cool or rainy weather conditions. Our facilities in Las Vegas are indoor and generally operate on a more consistent basis throughout the year, although in recent years the summer months have seen lower traffic. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 The Company's agreements with the Bryant Park Corporation (the Landlord ), (a private non-profit entity that manages Bryant Park under agreements with the New York City Department of Parks Recreation) for the Bryant Park Grill Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park expire on April 30, 2025. During July 2023 (for the Bryant Park Grill Cafe and September 2023 (for The Porch at Bryant Park) , the Company received requests for proposals (the "RFPs") from the Landlord to which we responded on October 26, 2023. The agreements offered under the RFPs for both locations are for new 10-year agreements, with one five-year renewal option. Any operator awarded the agreements must be approved by both the New York City Department of Parks Recreation and the New York Public Library. To date, the landlord has not announced the selection of a successful bidder; however, the landlord has made public statements of its intention to select an operator other than the Company. In response to these public statements and other information obtained by the Company, management has engaged outside advisors who have been assisting with our efforts to obtain the extensions by ensuring the RFP awards process is both fair and transparent. We intend to pursue all available options to protect our interests. 
 
 The Bryant Park Grill Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park, collectively, accounted for 31.1 million and 30.4 million of our total revenues in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represented approximately 17.35 and 16.78 of our total revenue for such periods, respectively. The Company s inability to extend or renew these leases on favorable terms, if at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Results of Operations 
 The Company s operating loss for the year ended September 28, 2024 (which includes a goodwill impairment charge of 4,000,000, a loss on the closure of El Rio Grande of 876,000 and impairment losses on right-of-use and long-lived assets in the amount of 2,500,000 related to Sequoia was 4,294,000, down 11.3 as compared to an operating loss for the year ended September 30, 2023 (which includes a goodwill impairment charge of 10,000,000) of 4,840,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Excluding the goodwill impairment charges of 4,000,000 and 10,000,000, respectively, for the fiscal years ended 2024 and 2023 and the loss on the closure of El Rio Grande of 876,000 and the impairment losses on right-of-use and long-lived assets of 2,500,000 related to Sequoia for fiscal year ended 2024, operating income for the year ended September 28, 2024 decreased 40.3 to 3,082,000 as compared to 5,160,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023. We attribute this decrease primarily to a decrease in same store sales as discussed below combined with increased base rents and inflationary pressures related to non-commodity items partially offset by the reversal of stock-based compensation expenses relating to forfeitures in the amount of 1,156,000 combined with the negative impact on the prior period of the temporary closure of Gallagher's Steakhouse for renovation on February 5, 2023 (which reopened on April 28, 2023).

The following table summarizes the significant components of the Company s operating results for the years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively: 
 Year Ended Variance September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 REVENUES: (in thousands) Food and beverage sales 179,110 180,820 (1,710) -0.9 Other revenue 4,435 3,973 462 11.6 Total revenues 183,545 184,793 (1,248) -0.7 COSTS AND EXPENSES: Food and beverage cost of sales 49,519 49,624 (105) -0.2 Payroll expenses 65,844 66,322 (478) -0.7 Occupancy expenses 24,622 23,472 1,150 4.9 Other operating costs and expenses 24,125 23,498 627 2.7 General and administrative expenses 12,263 12,407 (144) -1.2 Depreciation and amortization 4,090 4,310 (220) -5.1 Loss on closure of El Rio Grande 876 876 N/A Impairment losses on right-of-use and long-lived assets 2,500 2,500 N/A Goodwill impairment 4,000 10,000 (6,000) N/A Total costs and expenses 187,839 189,633 (1,794) -0.9 OPERATING LOSS (4,294) (4,840) 546 11.3 
 
 Revenues 
 During the year ended September 28, 2024, revenues decreased -0.7 as compared to revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023. We attribute this small decrease primarily to the changes in same-store sales discussed below. 
 Food and Beverage Same-Store Sales 
 On a Company-wide basis, same-store food and beverage sales for the year ended September 28, 2024 decreased 1.1 as compared with the year ended September 30, 2023 as follows: 
 Year Ended Variance September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands) Las Vegas 55,794 55,441 353 0.6 New York 37,318 37,039 279 0.8 Washington, D.C. 9,135 10,599 (1,464) -13.8 Atlantic City, NJ 2,923 2,999 (76) -2.5 Alabama 17,885 17,175 710 4.1 Florida 53,390 55,122 (1,732) -3.1 Same-store sales 176,445 178,375 (1,930) -1.1 Other 2,665 2,445 Food and beverage sales 179,110 180,820 
 Same-store sales in Las Vegas increased marginally which we primarily attribute to the negative impact to the prior period as a result of the temporary closure of Gallagher's Steakhouse for renovation from February 5, 2023 to April 27, 2023, partially offset by a decrease in customer traffic in the current year. Same-store sales in New York increased marginally which we primarily attribute to targeted menu price increases. Same-store sales in Washington, D.C. decreased 13.8 which we primarily attribute to 
 17 

lower headcounts, especially during lunch and after-work hours, which we attribute to continued hybrid work schedules as well as the closure of the property from Monday through lunch on Thursdays during winter months. Same-store sales in Atlantic City, NJ decreased 2.5 which we primarily attribute to lower customer traffic at the property where we are located. Same-store sales in Alabama increased 4.1 which we primarily attribute to better than expected customer traffic and targeted menu price increases. Same-store sales in Florida decreased 3.1 which we primarily attribute to lower headcounts as compared to the comparable prior period, which benefited from outsized volumes as a result of the population increase in Southeast Florida as a result of the migration of people during the pandemic partially offset by targeted menu price increases. Other food and beverage sales consist of administrative fees and other charges related to catered events. 
 Our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity. 
 Other Revenues 
 Included in other revenues are purchase service fees which represent commissions earned by a subsidiary of the Company for providing purchasing services to other restaurant groups, as well as merchandise sales, license fees, property management fees and other rentals. The increase in other revenues for the year ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to an increase in purchase service fees. 
 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Costs and expenses for the years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows (in thousands): 
 Year Ended September 28, 2024 to Total Revenues Year Ended September 30, 2023 to Total Revenues Increase (Decrease) Food and beverage cost of sales 49,519 27.0 49,624 26.9 (105) -0.2 Payroll expenses 65,844 35.9 66,322 35.9 (478) -0.7 Occupancy expenses 24,622 13.4 23,472 12.7 1,150 4.9 Other operating costs and expenses 24,125 13.1 23,498 12.7 627 2.7 General and administrative expenses 12,263 6.7 12,407 6.7 (144) -1.2 Depreciation and amortization 4,090 2.2 4,310 2.3 (220) -5.1 Loss on closure of El Rio Grande 876 0.5 876 N/A Impairment losses on right-of-use and long-lived assets 2,500 1.4 2,500 N/A Goodwill impairment 4,000 2.2 10,000 5.4 (6,000) N/A Total costs and expenses 187,839 189,633 (1,794) 
 
 Food and beverage costs as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 28, 2024 were consistent with last year which we attribute to stabilized commodity prices. 
 
 Payroll expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 28, 2024 were consistent with last year, which we attribute primarily to increased minimum wages in the states where we operate offset by better shift management and related overtime hours. 
 
 Occupancy expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 28, 2024 increased as compared to last year, which we attribute primarily to increases in base rents and increases in property and liability insurance premiums. 
 
 Other operating costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended September 28, 2024 increased as compared to last year primarily as a result of inflation. 
 
 General and administrative expenses (which relate solely to the corporate office in New York City) for the year ended September 28, 2024 decreased as compared to the same period of last year primarily as a result of the reversal of compensation 
 18 

expense in the amount of 1,134,000 related to options that expired or were cancelled unexercised partially offset by increased legal and consulting expenses and annual merit increases. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended September 28, 2024 decreased slightly as compared to the same period of last year, which we attribute primarily to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. 
 Loss on Closure of El Rio Grande 
 The Company advised the landlord of El Rio Grande (a consolidated VIE) we would be terminating the lease and closing the property permanently on or around January 1, 2025. In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a loss of 876,000 during the year ended September 28, 2024 consisting of: (i) rent and other costs incurred in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease in the amount of 398,000, (ii) accrued severance and other costs in the amount of 94,000, (iii) an impairment charge related to long-lived assets in the amount of 269,000 and (iv) the write-off of our security deposit in the amount of 238,000, all partially offset by a gain related to the write-off of ROU assets and related lease liabilities in the net amount of 123,000. 
 Impairment Losses on Right-of-Use and Long-lived Assets 
 During the year ended September 28, 2024, impairment indicators were identified at our Sequoia property located in Washington, D.C. due to lower-than-expected operating results. Accordingly, the Company tested the recoverability of Sequoia's ROU and long-lived assets and concluded they were not recoverable. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis, the Company recognized impairment charges of 1,561,000 and 939,000 related to Sequoia's ROU assets and long-lived assets, respectively. No impairment charges were recognized related to long-lived assets or ROU assets during the year ended September 30, 2023. Given the inherent uncertainty in projecting results of restaurants, the Company will continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets of Sequoia and several other restaurants on an ongoing basis. If expected performance is not realized, further impairment charges may be recognized in future periods, and such charges could be material. 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 Goodwill is the excess of cost over fair market value of tangible and intangible net assets acquired. Goodwill is not presently amortized but tested for impairment annually or when the facts or circumstances indicate a possible impairment of goodwill as a result of a continual decline in performance or as a result of fundamental changes in a market. 
 In performing its goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred. Due to the volatility of the Company's stock price in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the upcoming expiration of the current Bryant Park Grill Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park leases on April 30, 2025 and the related requests for proposals from the landlord for both locations received in July 2023 and September 2023, respectively (see Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company determined that there were indicators of potential impairment of its goodwill as of September 30, 2023. As of September 28, 2024, there had been a lack of communication from the landlord regarding our proposals. In August 2024, the Company became aware that the landlord was in discussions with another operator. Accordingly, the Company performed qualitative and quantitative assessments of its goodwill as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The fair value of our equity was determined using the income approach. Given the relatively low volume of shares traded as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company determined the income approach provided the best approximation of fair value. In the income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow analysis, which involved estimating the expected future after-tax cash flows generated and then discounting those cash flows to present value, reflecting the relevant risks associated with the achievement of projected cash flows, the possibility that the Bryant Park Grill Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park leases may not be renewed beyond their expirations on April 30, 2025, and the time value of money. This approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted cash flows from operations, and discount rates that reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows. 
 Based on the impairment analysis, the carrying amount of our equity exceeded its estimated fair value, which indicated an impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Accordingly, during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of 4,000,000 and 10,000,000, respectively, of which 4,000,000 and 8,000,000, respectively, was deductible for tax purposes and resulted in a deferred income tax benefit of 1,074,000 and 2,300,000, respectively. Such impairments have been attributed to factors such as, but not limited to, a decrease in the market price of the Company's common stock and lower than expected profitability. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income tax in numerous state taxing jurisdictions. Significant judgment and estimates are required in the determination of consolidated income tax expense. The provision for income taxes 
 19 

reflects federal income taxes calculated on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes which are calculated on a separate entity basis. 
 For state and local income tax purposes, certain losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary s income, with the exception of the restaurants operating in the District of Columbia. Accordingly, our overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of income and losses incurred at individual subsidiaries. 
 Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. 
 On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 CAA was enacted and provided clarification on the tax deductibility of expenses funded with PPP loans as fully deductible for tax purposes. During the years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company recorded income of 285,000 and 272,000, respectively, for financial reporting purposes related to the forgiveness of its PPP loans. The forgiveness of these amounts is not taxable. 
 
 The Company s overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as the utilization of state and local net operating loss carryforwards, the generation of FICA tax credits and the mix of earnings by state taxing jurisdictions as Nevada does not impose a state income tax, as compared to the other major state and local jurisdictions in which the Company has operations. Our overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as income earned by our VIEs, generation of FICA TIP credits and the mix of geographical income for state tax purposes as Nevada does not impose an income tax. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations and, in recent years, bank and other borrowings to finance specific transactions, acquisitions and large remodeling projects. We utilize cash generated from operations to fund the cost of developing and opening new restaurants and smaller remodeling projects of existing restaurants we own. Consistent with many other restaurant operators, we typically use operating lease arrangements for our restaurants. In recent years, we have been able to acquire the underlying real estate at several locations along with the restaurant operation. We believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage of our capital structure in a financially efficient manner. 
 The Company had a working capital deficit of 10,659,000 at September 28, 2024 as compared to working capital deficit of 5,932,000 at September 30, 2023. This increase in the deficit is primarily the result of all of our note payments becoming current as they mature through May 31, 2025. The Company is currently working with its lender on a new credit agreement which we expect to be completed in the second fiscal quarter of 2025; however, there can be no assurances that this agreement will be completed. We believe that our existing cash balances and current banking facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements and finance our operating activities for at least the next 12 months. 
 Inflation 
 Beginning in 2021, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events, causing supply chain challenges and significantly increased commodity and wage inflation. While we have seen improvements in many of these areas, some of these factors continued to impact our operating results in fiscal 2024. The ongoing impact of these events could lead to further shifts in consumer behavior, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product and services cost inflation, disruptions in our supply chain and delays in opening and acquiring new restaurants. If these factors significantly impact our cash flow in the future, we may again implement mitigation actions such as continued suspension of dividends, increasing borrowings or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our business, including possible impairments of assets. 
 While we have been able to offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by targeted increases in menu prices, coupled with more efficient purchasing practices, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. From time to time, competitive conditions will limit our menu pricing flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer discretionary spending for food away from home could make additional menu price increases imprudent. There can be no assurance that all of our future cost increases can be offset by higher menu prices or that higher menu prices will be accepted by our restaurant customers without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns.

Cash Flows for the Years Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 28, 2024 decreased to 4,654,000 as compared to 8,386,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023 and resulted primarily from changes in net working capital primarily related to prepaid, refundable and accrued income taxes and accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended September 28, 2024 was 2,392,000 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 1,276,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023. This decrease resulted primarily from proceeds from the maturity of certificates of deposit in the prior period partially offset by lower purchases of fixed assets at existing restaurants in the current period. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended September 28, 2024 was 5,404,000 and resulted primarily from principal payments on notes payable in the amount of 1,987,000, the payment of dividends in the amount of 2,028,000 and the payment of distributions to non-controlling interests in the amount of 1,389,000. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 was 19,686,000 and resulted primarily from principal payments on notes payable of 16,334,000 (including the prepayment of a promissory note in the amount of 6,666,000 on March 30, 2023 and the prepayment of three promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 6,046,000 on April 4, 2023), the payment of dividends in the amount of 2,252,000 and the payment of distributions to non-controlling interests in the amount of 1,139,000. 
 On November 8, 2023, February 6, 2024, and May 7, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") declared quarterly cash dividends of 0.1875, 0.1875, and 0.1875, respectively, per share, which were paid on December 13, 2023, March 13, 2024, and June 12, 2024, respectively, to the stockholders of record of the Company's common stock at the close of business on November 30, 2023, February 29, 2024, and May 31, 2024, respectively. The Board has not declared any dividends since May 7, 2024. Future decisions to pay dividends are at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon operating performance and other factors. 
 Restaurant Expansion and Other Developments 
 On April 8, 2022, the Company extended its lease for Gallagher's Steakhouse at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2032. In connection with the extension, the Company agreed to spend a minimum of 1,500,000 to materially refresh the premises by April 30, 2023 (as extended from September 30, 2022 due to supply chain issues). Accordingly, the property was substantially closed for renovation on February 5, 2023 and reopened on April 28, 2023. The total cost of the refresh was approximately 1,900,000. 
 On June 24, 2022, the Company extended its lease for America at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2033. In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of 4,000,000 to materially refresh the premises by December 31, 2025 (as extended from December 31, 2024, subject to further extension as set out in the agreement. To date approximately 100,000 has been spent on this refresh. 
 On July 21, 2022, the Company extended its lease for the Village Eateries at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2034. As part of this extension, the Broadway Burger Bar and Grill and Gonzalez y Gonzalez , were carved out of the Village Eateries footprint and the extended date for those two locations is December 31, 2033. In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of 3,500,000 to materially refresh all three of these premises by December 31, 2025 (as extended from June 30, 2023), subject to further extension as set out in the agreement. To date approximately 950,000 has been spent on this refresh. 
 Each of the above refresh obligations are to be consistent with designs approved by the landlord which shall not be unreasonably withheld. We have and will continue to pay all rent as required by the leases without abatement during construction. Note that our substantial completion of work set forth in plans approved by the landlord shall constitute our compliance with the requirements of the completion deadlines, regardless of whether or not the amount actually expended in connection therewith is less than the minimum. 
 Our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity. 
 We may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors.

Recent Restaurant Dispositions 
 The Company advised the landlord of El Rio Grande (a consolidated VIE) we would be terminating the lease and closing the property permanently on or around January 1, 2025. In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a loss of 876,000 during the year ended September 28, 2024 consisting of: (i) rent and other costs incurred in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease in the amount of 398,000, (ii) accrued severance and other costs in the amount of 94,000, (iii) an impairment charge related to long-lived assets in the amount of 269,000 and (iv) the write-off of our security deposit in the amount of 238,000, all partially offset by a gain related to the write-off of ROU assets and related lease liabilities in the net amount of 123,000. 
 Investment in and Receivable from New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC 
 On March 12, 2013, the Company made a 4,200,000 investment in the New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC NMR through its purchase of a membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, an existing member of NMR with a 63.7 ownership interest. On November 19, 2013, the Company invested an additional 464,000 in NMR through a purchase of an additional membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC resulting in a total ownership of 11.6 of Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, and an effective ownership interest in NMR of 7.4 , subject to dilution. In 2015, the Company invested an additional 222,000 in NMR with no change in ownership. In February 2017, the Company funded its proportionate share 222,000) of a 3,000,000 capital call bringing its total investment to 5,108,000 with no change in ownership. 
 During the years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company received distributions from NMR in the amounts of 26,000 and 52,000, respectively, which are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations for the years then ended. 
 In addition to the Company s ownership interest in NMR, if casino gaming is approved at the Meadowlands and NMR is granted the right to conduct said gaming, the Company shall be granted the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in the gaming facility with the exception of one restaurant. 
 In conjunction with this investment, the Company, through a 97 owned subsidiary, Ark Meadowlands LLC AM VIE ), also entered into a long-term agreement with NMR for the exclusive right to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities (the Racing F B Concessions located in the new raceway grandstand constructed at the Meadowlands Racetrack in northern New Jersey. Under the agreement, NMR is responsible to pay for the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Racing F B Concessions, and all revenues and profits thereof inure to the benefit of NMR. AM VIE receives an annual fee equal to 5 of the net profits received by NMR from the Racing F B Concessions during each calendar year. 
 On April 25, 2014, the Company loaned 1,500,000 to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC. The note bears interest at 3 , compounded monthly and added to the principal, and is due in its entirety on January 31, 2024. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium. The principal and accrued interest related to this note in the amounts of 1,442,000 and 1,399,000, are included in Investment In and Receivable From New Meadowlands Racetrack in the consolidated balance sheets at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. On April 30, 2023, the due date of the note was extended to June 30, 2029. 
 Notes Payable Bank 
 On March 30, 2023, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), with its lender, Bank Hapoalim B.M. BHBM ). This facility, which matures on June 1, 2025, replaced our revolving credit facility which was entered into on June 1, 2018 (the "Prior Credit Agreement"). Under the terms of the Credit Agreement: (i) a promissory note under the Prior Credit Agreement in the amount of 6,666,000 was repaid, (ii) BHBM established a new revolving credit facility in the amount of 10,000,000 with a commitment termination date of May 31, 2025, (iii) the Company may use the revolving commitments of BHBM to obtain letters of credit up to a sublimit thereunder of 1,000,000, and (iv) the LIBOR rate option for all borrowings was replaced with the secured overnight financing rate for U.S. Government Securities SOFR ). Advances under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's election at the time of the advance, at either BHBM's prime rate of interest plus a 0.45 spread or SOFR plus a 3.65 spread. In addition, there is a 0.30 per annum fee for any unused portion of the 10,000,000 revolving facility. As of September 28, 2024, no advances were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of September 28, 2024, the weighted average interest on the outstanding BHBM indebtedness was approximately 8.9 . The replacement of LIBOR with SOFR as a reference rate in our debt agreements did not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement, which include the promissory notes as discussed in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements in the aggregate amount of 5,167,000, are secured by all tangible and intangible personal property (including 
 22 

accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, general intangibles, documents, chattel paper, instruments, letter-of-credit rights, investment property, intellectual property and deposit accounts) and fixtures of the Company. The loan agreements provide, among other things, that the Company meet minimum quarterly tangible net worth amounts, maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and meet minimum annual net income amounts. The loan agreements also contain customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants as well as customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, relating to other indebtedness, capital expenditures, liens, affiliate transactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership. The Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of September 28, 2024 except for the minimum annual net income requirement. On December 11, 2024, BHBM agreed to waive applicability of this covenant (and any breach arising therefrom) as of September 28, 2024. 
 Paycheck Protection Program Loans 
 Prior to fiscal 2023, the Company received loan proceeds from several banks in the aggregate amount of 15,106,000 (the PPP Loans under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, which was enacted March 27, 2020. Under the terms of the PPP Loans, some or all of the amounts thereunder, including accrued interest, were to be forgiven if they were used for Qualifying Expenses as described in and in compliance with the CARES Act. During the year ended September 30, 2023, 272,000 of PPP Loans (including 6,000 of accrued interest), were forgiven. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company made payments related to the unforgiven portion of PPP Loans in the aggregate amount of 531,000. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, no PPP Loans were outstanding; however, the Company was denied forgiveness of one PPP Loan in fiscal 2023 in the amount of 285,000 and accordingly such amount was repaid. The Company filed an appeal concurrent with the repayment, which was granted and the amount was forgiven and refunded to the Company in November 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. While all of these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
 We believe that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report. 
 Below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical: 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We recognize revenues when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a restaurant guest or other customer. Revenues from restaurant operations are presented net of discounts, coupons, employee meals and complimentary meals and recognized when food, beverage and retail products are sold. Sales tax collected from customers is excluded from sales and the obligation is included in sales tax payable until the taxes are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. Catering service revenue is generated through contracts with customers whereby the customer agrees to pay a contract rate for the service. Revenues from catered events are recognized in income upon satisfaction of the performance obligation (the date the event is held) and all customer payments, including nonrefundable upfront deposits, are deferred as a liability until such time. 
 Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption. Deferrals are not reduced for potential non-use as we generally have a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions in which they are sold. 
 Other revenues include purchase service fees which represent commissions earned by a subsidiary of the Company for providing purchasing services to other restaurant groups, as well as license fees, property management fees and other rentals. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are used for, but are not limited to: (i) projected cash flows related to asset impairments, including goodwill and intangibles, (ii) income tax valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, (iii) allowances for potential credit losses on receivables, (iv) assumptions regarding 
 23 

discount rates related to lease accounting, (v) the useful lives and recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as fixed assets and intangibles, (vi) fair values of financial instruments, (vii) share-based compensation, (viii) estimates made in connection with acquisition purchase price allocations, (ix) uncertain tax positions, and (x) determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. The Company s accounting estimates require the use of judgment as future events and the effect of these events cannot be predicted with certainty. The accounting estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired and as more information is obtained. The Company evaluates and updates assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may use outside experts to assist in the Company s evaluation, as considered necessary. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment subject to amortization, and right-of-use assets ("ROU assets") are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long-lived assets, the Company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long-lived assets. If the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. Various factors including estimated future sales growth and estimated profit margins are included in this analysis. 
 The Company considers a triggering event related to long-lived or ROU assets in a net asset position to have occurred related to a specific restaurant if the restaurant s cash flows for the last 12 months are less than a minimum threshold or if consistent levels of undiscounted cash flows for the remaining lease period are less than the carrying value of the restaurant s assets. Additionally, the Company considers a triggering event related to ROU assets to have occurred related to a specific lease if the location has been subleased and future estimated sublease income is less than current lease payments. If the Company concludes that the carrying value of certain long-lived and ROU assets will not be recovered based on expected undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the long-lived or ROU assets to their estimated fair value. The fair value is measured on a nonrecurring basis using unobservable (Level 3) inputs. There is uncertainty in the projected undiscounted future cash flows used in the Company's impairment review analysis, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions. If actual performance does not achieve the projections, or if the assumptions used change in the future, the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges in future periods, and such charges could be material. 
 During the year ended September 28, 2024, impairment indicators were identified at our Sequoia property located in Washington, D.C. due to lower-than-expected operating results. Accordingly, the Company tested the recoverability of Sequoia's ROU and long-lived assets and concluded they were not recoverable. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis, the Company recognized impairment charges of 1,561,000 and 939,000 related to Sequoia's ROU assets and long-lived assets, respectively. No impairment charges were recognized related to long-lived assets or ROU assets during the year ended September 30, 2023. Given the inherent uncertainty in projecting results of restaurants, the Company will continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets of Sequoia and several other restaurants on an ongoing basis. If expected performance is not realized, further impairment charges may be recognized in future periods, and such charges could be material. 
 Recoverability of Investment in New Meadowlands Racetrack NMR 
 The carrying value of our investment in Meadowlands Newmark LLC, which has a 63.7 ownership in NMR, is determined using the cost method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable, if dividends are declared. We review our investment in NMR each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on its fair value. 
 As a result, we performed an assessment of the recoverability of our indirect investment in NMR as of September 28, 2024 which involved critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management estimated include, among others, the probability of gambling being approved in northern New Jersey and NMR obtaining a license to operate a casino, revenue levels, cost of capital, marketing spending, tax rates and capital spending. 
 In performing this assessment, we estimate the fair value of our investment in NMR using our best estimate of these assumptions which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and our inability as a minority shareholder to control certain outcomes and, thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. 
 24 

As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result. 
 Leases 
 We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. An arrangement contains a lease if it implicitly or explicitly identifies an asset to be used and conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration. As a lessee, we include operating leases in Operating lease ROU assets and Operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Options are included when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amendments or modifications to lease terms are accounted for as variable lease payments. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less are accounted for using the practical expedient which allows for straight-line rent expense over the remaining term of the lease. 
 Deferred Income Tax Valuation Allowance 
 We provide such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized. Certain items, such as state and local tax loss carryforwards, are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies. Future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period. 
 Goodwill and Trademarks 
 Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and trademarks annually (at the end of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or trademarks are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 With respect to goodwill, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test. When performing the quantitative test, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of our equity, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value. 
 
 In performing its goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred. Due to the volatility of the Company's stock price in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the upcoming expiration of the current Bryant Park Grill Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park leases on April 30, 2025 and the related requests for proposals from the landlord for both locations received in July 2023 and September 2023, respectively (see Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company determined that there were indicators of potential impairment of its goodwill as of September 30, 2023. As of September 28, 2024, there had been a lack of communication from the landlord regarding our proposals. In August 2024, the Company became aware that the landlord was in discussions with another operator. Accordingly, the Company performed qualitative and quantitative assessments for its goodwill as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The fair value of the equity was determined using the income approach. Given the relatively low volume of shares traded as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company determined the income approach provided the best approximation of fair value. In the income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow analysis, which involved estimating the expected future after-tax cash flows generated and then discounting those cash flows to present value, reflecting the relevant risks associated with the achievement of projected cash flows, the possibility that the Bryant Park Grill Cafe and The Porch at Bryant Park leases may not be renewed beyond their expirations on April 30, 2025, and the time value of money. This approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted cash flows from operations, and discount rates that reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows. More specifically, the weighted average cost of capital is a sensitive estimate as it reflects the market conditions including the risk that the Bryant Park Grill Caf and The Porch at Bryant Park leases will not be renewed. 
 Our impairment analysis for trademarks consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets. This comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment. For the years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our impairment analysis did not result in any other charges related to trademarks. 
 25 

Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes it as expense over the applicable vesting period using the straight-line method. Excess income tax benefits related to share-based compensation expense that must be recognized directly in equity are considered financing rather than operating cash flow activities. 
 The fair value of each of the Company s stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of the Company s common stock, the expected dividend yield of our stock, the expected life of the options and the risk-free interest rate.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 28, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024 based upon the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on our assessment, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2024. 
 This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting as management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the permanent exemption of the SEC that permits us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting, other than changes to certain restaurant-level procedures with respect to approval limits and reconciliation procedures. 
 Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 Ark Restaurants Corp. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ark Restaurants Corp. and Subsidiaries (the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the two years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to Ark Restaurants Corp. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Long-lived Asset and Right-of-Use Asset Valuation (Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 Long-lived assets, such as property and plant and equipment subject to amortization, and right-of-use assets ("ROU assets") are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long-lived assets, the Company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long-lived assets. If the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. Various factors including estimated future sales growth and estimated profit margins are included in this analysis. 
 
 The Company considers a triggering event related to long-lived assets or ROU assets in a net asset position to have occurred related to a specific restaurant if the restaurant s undiscounted cash flows for the remaining lease period are less than the carrying value of the restaurant s assets. Additionally, the Company considers a triggering event related to ROU assets to have occurred related to a specific lease if the location has been subleased and future estimated sublease income is less than current lease payments. If the Company concludes that the carrying value of certain long-lived assets and ROU assets will not be recovered 
 F-1 

based on expected undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the long-lived or ROU assets to their estimated fair value. The Company recorded impairment charges for its location in Washington, DC of 2,500,000 and for one of its locations in New York City of 876,000 during the year ended September 28, 2024. 
 
 Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in performing their long-lived asset and right-of-use asset impairment analysis specifically surrounding the development of undiscounted cash flow forecasts. The related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining the cash flow forecasts to be utilized was complex, subjective, and challenging, and required a high degree of auditor judgment. 
 
 How our Audit Addressed the Critical Audit Matter 
 
 Our principal audit procedures related to this critical audit matter included the following, among others: 
 
 We gained an understanding of and evaluated the design and implementation of the Company s controls that address the risk of material misstatement related to potential impairment. 
 
 We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to the consideration of impairment for long-lived assets for reasonableness. 
 
 We tested the reasonableness of the underlying data used to determine the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. 
 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the impairment analysis for the restaurants by comparing forecasted undiscounted cash flows to historical cash flows from each restaurant location, and evaluating management's future operating forecasts. 
 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate that no impairment charges were appropriate during the year other than what was recorded. 
 
 Goodwill Valuation (Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The Company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of the Company to its carrying value. The Company determined the income approach provided the best approximation of fair value given the relatively low volume of shares of the Company s stock traded and the lack of reliable market data. In the income approach the Company utilized the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margin. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The Company recorded an impairment charge of 4,000,000 for the year ended September 28, 2024. 
 
 Significant judgment is exercised by management in estimating its fair value and the difference between its fair value and carrying value. Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management s judgments in determining the valuation of goodwill was challenging, subjective, and complex and required a high degree of auditor judgment. 
 
 How our Audit Addressed the Critical Audit Matter 
 
 Our principal audit procedures related to this critical audit matter included the following, among others: 
 
 We gained an understanding of and evaluated the design and implementation of the Company s controls that address the risk of material misstatement related to potential impairment. 
 
 We evaluated management s significant accounting policies related to the consideration of goodwill impairment for reasonableness. 
 
 We evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and profit margins by comparing actual results to management s historical forecasts. 
 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management s assumptions by: 
 
 Comparing forecasts of revenue and profit margins to historical revenues and profit margins. 
 Reading select internal communications to management and the Board of Directors. 
 F-2 

Considering the remaining lease terms of the company s locations as the lease terms could have an impact on future cashflows. Our consideration included challenging management s assumptions in its valuation regarding the risk of non-renewal of significant leases in its various locations. 
 Involving a valuation professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in considering the reasonableness of the weighted average cost of capital used in the discounted cash flow forecast

In Alabama, the Company operates Original Oyster Houses , in Gulf Shores and in Spanish Fort. 
 Inflation Beginning in 2021, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events, causing supply chain challenges and significantly increased commodity and wage inflation. While we have seen improvements in many of these areas, some of these factors continued to impact our operating results in fiscal 2024. The ongoing impact of these events could lead to further shifts in consumer behavior, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product and services cost inflation, disruptions in our supply chain and delays in opening and acquiring new restaurants. If these factors significantly impact our cash flow in the future, we may again implement mitigation actions such as continued suspension of dividends, increasing borrowings or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our business, including possible impairments of assets.

 for furniture, fixtures and equipment and up to years for buildings and related improvements. Amortization of improvements to leased properties is computed using the straight-line method based upon the initial term of the applicable lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is less, and ranges from to years. For leases with renewal periods at the Company s option, if failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to the Company, management may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of appropriate estimated useful lives. Routine expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or disposition of fixed assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.

 to years and typically include renewal options. Renewal options are recognized as part of the ROU assets and lease liabilities if it is reasonably certain at the date of adoption that we would exercise the options to extend the lease. Our real estate leases typically provide for fixed minimum rent payments and/or contingent rent payments based upon sales in excess of specified thresholds. When the achievement of such sales thresholds are deemed to be probable, variable lease expense is accrued in proportion to the sales recognized during the period. For operating leases that include rent holidays and rent escalation clauses, we recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the date we take possession of the leased property. We record the straight-line lease expense and any contingent rent, if applicable, in occupancy expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Many of our real estate leases also require us to pay real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs and other occupancy costs non-lease components which are included in occupancy related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
 As there were no explicit rates provided in our leases, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
