PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 OUR COMPANY 
 
 We provide equipment, consumables and services for semiconductor wafer fabrication and device packaging. Our products are used in fabricating semiconductor devices, such as silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon (Si) power devices, digital and analog devices, power electronic packages, advanced semiconductor packages and electronic assemblies. We sell these products to semiconductor device and module manufacturers worldwide, particularly in Asia, North America and Europe. 
 
 Our semiconductor fabrication solutions include consumables, equipment and services for wafer polishing, cleaning, slicing and dicing. Our thermal processing solutions include reflow equipment for chip packaging and electronic assembly, diffusion furnaces and furnaces used to produce ceramic based power semiconductor packages and passive electronic components. 
 
 The focus of our strategy is to expand our consumables and service business for semiconductor wafer fabrication and to capitalize on opportunities for thermal processing equipment in advanced packaging and power electronic applications. 
 
 We categorize each of our subsidiaries into one of two reportable segments, based primarily on the industries they serve: 

Reportable Segment 
 
 of 2024 Consolidated Net Revenue 

Thermal Processing Solutions 

68 

Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions 

32 

These reportable segments are comprised of the following five wholly-owned subsidiaries: 
 
 Thermal Processing Solutions (formerly called Semiconductor): 
 
 BTU, a Delaware corporation based in Westford, Massachusetts, with operations in China, Malaysia and the UK, acquired in January 2015. 

Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions (formerly called Material and Substrate): 
 
 PR Hoffman, an Arizona corporation based in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, acquired in July 1997; 

Advanced Compound Materials, Inc., a Delaware corporation based in Spartanburg, South Carolina, founded in 2023; 

Intersurface Dynamics, a Connecticut corporation based in Bethel, Connecticut, acquired in March 2021; and 

Entrepix, an Arizona corporation based in Phoenix, Arizona, acquired in January 2023. 

In both of our divisions we are focused on semiconductor and related processes and markets. Amtech is uniquely positioned in that our products are employed throughout the early and late stages of semiconductor and electronics manufacturing. Our products are key to the earliest stages of silicon or silicon carbide wafer manufacturing, then in semiconductor device manufacturing, then advanced semiconductor packaging and then finally in electronics assembly. Our thermal processing solutions business provides high performance equipment used in solder reflow operations for advanced semiconductor packaging and electronic assembly, furnaces used for producing power semiconductor packaging substrates and electronic components, and diffusion furnaces used in wafer processing. 
 6 

Reflow operations provide a cost effective, high throughput process for electronic packaging and assembly. Our equipment provides the precise temperature, atmospheric control and uniformity required to achieve high yields in mass production reflow operations. Our flux management system scrubs oven gasses to minimize downtime, reduce defects from flux contamination and reduce environmental emissions. 
 
 The semiconductor industry is historically cyclical with constantly evolving technical requirements and advancements and can be subject to tariffs and sourcing restrictions driven by geopolitical tensions. Therefore, future growth and profitability will depend on cyclical trends, our ability to produce equipment regionally and meeting performance requirements as technical requirements evolve. We are currently in a longer-than-historical-average contraction cycle, which we believe is due primarily to a prolonged downturn in demand for industrial equipment, computers and smartphones following a spike in demand for these products during the COVID pandemic and a decline in growth expectations for electric vehicles. 
 
 Our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions business provides processing consumables, equipment and services for wafer production. Our PR Hoffman consumables are used for lapping and Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) processes in the manufacturing of SiC and Si power devices, analog devices, optics, ceramics and photonics. Our Entrepix products and services include equipment for SiC and Si wafer cleaning, testing equipment used for optimizing CMP processes, CMP equipment parts and services, and CMP foundry services. Our Intersurface Dynamics products include lubricants, cooling fluids and cleaning chemicals used for semiconductor wafer and optics processing and dispersants for CMP slurries. 
 
 CMP processes are used to provide a high degree of flatness, parallelism, and surface finish. Common applications for this technology are silicon wafers used for semiconductor digital and analog devices, SiC wafers for power devices, optics and ceramics. These devices are used in a variety of applications including computers and servers, automotive electronics, industrial electronics, mobile phones, telecommunications equipment and medical devices. 
 
 We believe our product portfolio, developed through a track record of technological innovation as well as the integration of key acquisitions, provides exceptional value to semiconductor manufacturing by increasing yields, efficiency and throughput. We have been providing manufacturing solutions to the semiconductor industry for over 30 years and have leveraged our semiconductor technology and industry presence to capitalize on growth opportunities. 
 
 For information regarding net revenue, operating income and identifiable assets attributable to each of our two reportable segments, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report. For information on the products of each reportable segment, see Thermal Processing Solutions Products and Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions Products within this Item 1. Business section. For information regarding risks to our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Our fiscal year is from October 1 to September 30. Unless otherwise stated, references to the years 2024, 2023 and 2022 relate to the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 ACQUISITION 
 
 On January 17, 2023 we acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Entrepix, an Arizona based manufacturer of chemical mechanical polishing CMP technology for a cash purchase price of 39.2 million. Entrepix s CMP technology portfolio and water cleaning equipment complements our existing substrate polishing and wet process chemical offerings. Entrepix's results of operations are included in our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. 
 
 7 

GROWTH AND INVESTMENT STRATEGY 
 
 We believe there are three key secular trends that are key to our future growth: 
 Advanced Mobility - Advanced Mobility encompasses both the development and adoption of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, including both EV and HEV, as well as advanced automotive electronics including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems ("ADAS"), infotainment and telematics. Our products intersect these markets in multiple ways: CMP consumables and wafer cleaning systems for the SiC substrates used in the EV power invertors; thermal processing systems for producing EV battery cooling systems and ceramic substrates for HEV power semiconductor packaging; and reflow ovens for ADAS, infotainment and telematics component assemblies. 

Supply Chain Resiliency - There is a global trend of creating supply chain resiliency by expanding and/or relocating operations outside of mainland China. We believe these facilities will create demand for new equipment and services in growing regions like Mexico and Southeast Asia. 

Artificial Intelligence - With Artificial Intelligence ("AI"), our reflow oven systems are the favored choice for Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test Services ("OSATS") providers who perform advanced packaging of the AI chips. 

We continue to invest in research and development, including the introduction of our next-generation reflow platform, Aurora, in 2023. Historically, we have grown our business primarily through acquisitions, including the businesses that currently comprise our two reportable segments in the Thermal Processing Solutions and Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions industries: BTU, PR Hoffman, Intersurface Dynamics and Entrepix. Our 2023 acquisition of Entrepix bolstered our offerings in the CMP technology space and incorporated wafer cleaning into our existing capital equipment product lines. We will continue to pursue acquisitions to supplement organic growth and have added market development resources globally to accelerate organic growth. 
 
 Grow consumables revenue to reduce vulnerability to semiconductor business cycles. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and the conditions of this industry remain volatile. We are currently in a longer-than-historical-average contraction cycle, which we believe is due to the capacity that was pulled in during COVID as demand for consumer electronics spiked during the pandemic and reduced expectations for EV growth rates. While all industry participants have been impacted by these fluctuations in demand, they can be particularly problematic for equipment suppliers who rely on capacity expansion to drive orders for their equipment. These sharp business cycles not only impact short-term financial results but can also weaken the strength of suppliers as they right-size their organizations to align with the reduced production demand. Our line of consumables products, including templates, carriers, polishing-related chemicals and spare parts, generates continuous revenue streams regardless of capacity expansions as they are used in equipment already in service. In an effort to minimize both the financial shortfalls and organizational harm of these business cycles, we are seeking to increase the consumables portion of our business. Our initial focus is on aggressively growing the consumable business in our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment, which was approximately 32 of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2024. In addition, we are working to transform the aftermarket sales business in our Thermal Processing Solutions division, leveraging the strength of our expansive installed base to increase higher-margin sales of replacement parts and services. 
 
 Increase the portion of our product line portfolio tied to high-growth, megatrend end markets such as EV and HEV. We believe the opportunity for organic growth through strategic alignment to projects tied to megatrends is an opportunity that exists across all our divisions. In the Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment, processing of SiC substrates is directly tied to the production of power modules used in electric vehicles and in other green technology applications such as wind and solar power. Our Thermal Processing Solutions segment has multiple intersections with EV and HEV production, including the use of our diffusion furnaces and surface-mount technology reflow products to manufacture power semiconductors and our high-temp furnaces used in DBC applications used in HEV power modules. In order to increase the portion of our business tied to these high-growth megatrends, we are employing multiple tactics and strategies, including strategic selling and customer-centric product development. 
 
 Customer-centric product development in R D. In order to both increase the output of our development teams and mitigate the risk associated with the introduction of new products, we are emphasizing and prioritizing 
 8 

customer-centric product development in all of our divisions. For example, the development and roll out of the Aurora reflow system for BTU employed direct customer input in the manufacturing requirements, and the new systems were first deployed as beta units to customers in multiple regions for validation. In addition, development of equipment and aftermarket solutions at Entrepix has focused on eliminating customer pain points, often in areas overlooked by the industry. We have added key customer-facing resources for our Semiconductor Fabrications Solutions segment to enable this type of customer collaboration in all geographic regions. In evaluating potential R D projects in our portfolio, opportunities where a strong customer partner or partners exist will be given priority over internally-driven programs. 
 
 Enhance and invest in legacy business operations. Our legacy business is key to funding both organic and inorganic growth opportunities across our divisions. Throughout 2024, we have been re-enforcing Amtech s core values (Safety, Customer Focus and Continuous Improvement) across all divisions and locations. We have increased cross-divisional sharing of resources and expertise, such as best practices and global sourcing. This strategy has been developed by our CEO, CFO and CHRO, in conjunction with our Vice President of Operations, Vice President of Sales and Customer Service, Segment Managers and Corporate Director of Strategic Marketing, to ensure these advancements are implemented uniformly across all Amtech operations. During 2024, we made investments to strengthen and expand our manufacturing capacity for CMP consumables to meet anticipated growth demands from the SiC industry segment and reduce single-point failure risks to our business. We also relocated our domestic BTU facility to a smaller facility that significantly reduced fixed costs and was better aligned with a fab-lite manufacturing model that was implemented with the support of contract manufacturing partners. 
 
 THERMAL PROCESSING AND SEMICONDUCTOR FABRICATION SOLUTIONS OPERATIONS 
 
 We provide reflow equipment for chip packaging and electronic assembly, diffusion furnaces for wafer processing and furnaces used to produce ceramic based power semiconductor packages and passive electronic components as well as wafer cleaning equipment, CMP polishing consumables, wafer processing lubricants, coolants and cleaning chemicals and related services to leading semiconductor manufacturers. 
 
 As demand for increasingly sophisticated electronic devices continues, new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), EVs, HEVs, advances in consumer electronics, 5G communications, and IoT will help drive future growth. Electronic equipment continues to become more complex, yet end users demand smaller, lighter and less expensive devices. This trend, in turn, requires increased performance and reduced cost for electronic assemblies, printed circuit boards and semiconductors. In response to these developments, manufacturers are increasingly employing more sophisticated production and assembly techniques requiring more advanced manufacturing equipment and related consumables. 
 
 Although the semiconductor market has experienced significant growth over the past fifteen years, it remains cyclical by nature. The market is characterized by short-term periods of under or over utilization of capacity for most semiconductors, including microprocessors, memory, power management chips and other logic devices. When capacity utilization decreases due to the addition of excess capacity, semiconductor manufacturers typically slow their purchasing of capital equipment. Conversely, when capacity utilization increases, so does capital spending. We believe the continued expansion of our consumable and aftermarket product offerings, primarily in our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment, will enable us to partially offset some of these cyclical effects. 
 
 THERMAL PROCESSING SOLUTIONS PRODUCTS 
 
 Our furnace equipment is manufactured in our facilities in Massachusetts and China and via contract manufacturers in Canada and Mexico. The following paragraphs describe the products that comprise our current product lines in our semiconductor business: 
 
 Continuous Thermal Processing Systems. We produce and sell thermal processing systems used in the solder reflow and curing stages of printed circuit board assembly as well as systems for the thermal processes used in advanced semiconductor packaging including 2.5D and flip-chip. In electronics assembly our ovens are used primarily in the advanced, high-density segments of the market that utilize surface mount technology. 
 
 9 

Flip-chip reflow provides the physical and electronic bond of the semiconductor device to its package. Our range of convection reflow systems, utilizing closed loop convection technology, are rated at up to 400 C and operate in air or nitrogen atmospheres. These products are manufactured at our ISO 9001:2015 certified facility in Shanghai, China and utilize forced impingement convection technology to transfer heat to the substrate. Using configurable heating elements of up to eight kilowatts, they can process substrates in dual-lane, dual-speed configurations, thereby enabling our customers to double production without increasing the machine s footprint. These products are available in four models based on the heated lengths of thermal processing chambers. Heated length is based on the customer's required production rate and loading requirements. 
 
 High-Temperature Belt Furnace. We also produce and sell high-temperature belt furnaces, which have been manufactured in North America for over six decades with ISO 9001:2015 quality certification safe-guarding that each unit is subject to exacting build and test criteria. These furnaces operate at temperatures up to 1180 C and are capable of processing in controlled atmospheres, such as nitrogen, argon, and hydrogen. Applications include DBC, furnace brazing, annealing, glass-to-metal sealing, sintering, and heat-treating for diverse markets including automotive, semiconductors, aerospace and medical. 
 
 Horizontal Diffusion Furnaces. We produce and sell 200mm and 300mm horizontal diffusion and deposition furnaces. Our horizontal furnaces currently address several steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process, including diffusion, high temperature oxidation (used in silicon power chips), and annealing. 
 
 Our horizontal furnaces generally consist of three large modules: the load station, where the loading of the wafers occurs; the furnace section, which is comprised of one to four thermal reactor chambers; and the gas distribution cabinet, where the flow of gases into the reactor chambers is controlled and is often configured through a range of options to meet the requirements of our customers particular process needs. The horizontal furnaces utilize a combination of existing industry and proprietary technologies and are sold primarily to semiconductor customers. Our products are capable of processing all currently existing wafer sizes. 
 
 SEMICONDUCTOR FABRICATION SOLUTIONS PRODUCTS 
 
 Our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment manufactures the products described below in Arizona, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Connecticut and sells them under our Entrepix, PR Hoffman and Intersurface Dynamics brand names. 
 
 Double-Sided Wafer Cleaning System. The Entrepix Double-Sided Wafer Cleaning System (OnTrak) is a single wafer cleaner that uses water or mild chemistries supplied through PVA brushes to clean both sides of a substrate simultaneously. These wafers (substrates) require cleaning following various process steps that leave the substrate contaminated by material particles. The system is designed to accept wet wafers in and send each substrate through two brush cleaning steps followed by a rinse and a spin dry while also providing heat via a high-powered lamp to dry any residual liquid droplets. The Entrepix cleaner is commonly used in post polishing steps, prime silicon/silicon carbide cleaning, epitaxial silicon deposition processes, and general wafer cleaning needs. 
 
 Entegrity Head Tester. The Entrepix Entegrity Head Tester is a table-top CMP head testing system that provides our customers with invaluable data regarding their head consumables that make up the polishing heads. The system allows users to customize operation and recipe programming. This allows the user to test individual zones for leaks or cross talk and track each head's performance by generating data that can be used to track issues with head rebuild before it is installed on the polisher. The Entegrity s user friendly touch interface displays data in real time, and also provides a live graph of the individual zone s performance. The ability to scan each head barcode prior to testing allows the user to create a data set for each specific head that can be viewed on the screen or downloaded via network connection. 
 
 Substrate Carriers . We manufacture carriers in a variety of sizes and materials. Sizes range from 3 to 38 inches in diameter using a variety of special steels, laminates and extruded polymer raw materials. Silicon wafers, compound semiconductor wafers, and large optics require these special insert carriers. These carriers combine the strength of hardened steel as the processing backbone with a softer plastic material in the work holes known as an insert. Inserts are permanently molded into the work holes via a pressurized process. These inserted work holes provide smoother processing, improved wafer total thickness variation (TTV) and improved wafer edge quality. Insert carriers are available for all wafer sizes from 75mm to 450mm and can be made from hardened and tempered carbon steel or 
 10 

specialized stainless steel when metal contamination is a processing concern. Insert carriers are widely accepted as the industry solution for both prime wafer and reclaim wafer manufacturers when dual sided lapping or polishing are utilized in the front-end wafer process. 
 
 Substrate Polishing Templates . Our polishing templates are used to securely hold SiC, silicon, sapphire or other wafer materials in place during single-sided wax-free CMP polishing processes. Polishing templates are customized for specific applications and are manufactured to extremely tight tolerances. We offer a variety of options to provide the best solution for each specific process. Polishing templates are manufactured for all brands of tools and virtually any wax-free customer process. Critical front-end wafer surface specifications are finalized during the polishing process. 
 
 Substrate Process Chemicals . Through Intersurface Dynamics, we produce and sell substrate process chemicals which are used to achieve specific surface morphologies on a variety of materials. Our substrate process chemical customers include some of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor devices, silicon wafers, precision optics, ophthalmic lens, advanced displays and flat glass. We offer three different product lines: Tensor Series Products, Vector Series Products, and Challenge Series Products. Tensor Series Products are used by manufacturers of integrated circuits in applications such as cleaning, etching, dicing and CMP. Vector Series Products were designed specifically for grinding, sawing, lapping, cleaning, etching and polishing semiconductor materials such as silicon wafers. Challenge Series Products address similar processes for manufacturers of precision optics, technical ceramics and advanced displays helping to achieve optimum yields. 
 
 MANUFACTURING, RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLY CHAIN 
 
 Our Thermal Processing Equipment manufacturing activities consist primarily of engineering design to meet specific and evolving customer needs and procurement and assembly of various commercial and proprietary components into finished thermal processing systems in Massachusetts and China or via our contract manufacturing partners in Canada and Mexico. 
 
 Our manufacturing activities in the polishing business include laser-cutting and other fabrication steps in producing lapping and polishing consumables, including carriers, templates, gears, wear items and spare parts in our ISO 9001:2015 certified facility in Pennsylvania, as well as our facility in South Carolina, from raw materials manufactured to our specifications by our suppliers. These products are engineered and designed for specific applications and to meet the increasingly tight tolerances required by our customers. Many items, such as proprietary components for our semiconductor equipment, are purchased from suppliers who manufacture these items to our specifications. 
 
 Our cleaner manufacturing activities include electrical and mechanical assembly of components and assemblies for the construction of two versions of our double-side scrubbers/cleaners at our Phoenix facility. These components and assemblies are engineered and designed for specific applications and to meet the increasingly tight tolerances required by our customers. Many items are purchased from suppliers who manufacture these items to our specifications. We also utilize our second manufacturing center in north Phoenix to manufacture and machine parts from raw materials, for our own use in construction of the cleaners as well as for customers. 
 
 Final assembly and tests of our machines are performed within our manufacturing facilities. Quality control is maintained through inspection of incoming materials and components, in-process inspection during equipment assembly, testing of assemblies and final inspection and, when practical, operation of manufactured equipment prior to shipment. 
 
 Our polishing supplies business relies on key suppliers for certain materials, including specialized steel mills in Germany and Japan, an injection molding machine, a single-sourced pad supplier from Japan and an adhesive manufacturer. Injection molding for our insert carriers is subcontracted out to a third party. To minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts, we seek to maintain appropriate inventory levels of key raw materials and parts. In addition, in order to respond to the anticipated growth rates for SiC substrate manufacturing and to provide our customers with assurance for business continuity and risk mitigation, we have opened a new manufacturing facility for SiC related polishing consumables in Spartanburg, South Carolina. This facility, run by our ACMI subsidiary, not only provides additional manufacturing capacity, but it also brings us geographically closer to key customers in the region allowing for even faster response times. 
 
 11 

During 2023, we partnered with contract manufacturers CM to improve our lead times and diversify our manufacturing operations. One CM is located in Canada and is building our high temperature belt furnaces. By partnering with this CM, we achieved record shipments of our high temperature belt furnaces. We also have partnered with a CM in Mexico, who will build our Pyramax furnaces and ship to our North American and European customers. In addition, we are using a CM partner as well as our Shanghai factory as backup sources to manufacture key components for certain high temperature belt furnaces. This CM strategy is key to ensuring we are not concentrated in one geographic location and to give us additional capacity during peak semiconductor cycles. 
 
 CUSTOMERS AND SEASONALITY 
 
 Our customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductor substrates, devices and electronic assemblies. Additionally, our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment also serves customers in the ceramics and optics industries. During 2024, 59 of our net revenue came from customers outside of North America. This group represented 52 of revenues in 2023. In 2024, net revenue was distributed among customers in the following geographic regions: 
 North/South America 41 (39 of which is in the United States) 

Asia 43 (including 20 in China, 12 in Malaysia and 8 in Taiwan) 

Europe 16 (including 6 in Germany and 3 in Czech Republic) 

No customer accounted for 10 of our net revenues in 2024. In 2023, one Thermal Processing Solutions customer accounted for 11 of our net revenues. 
 
 Our business is not seasonal in nature, but is cyclical based on the capital equipment investment patterns of semiconductor manufacturers. These expenditure patterns are based on many factors, including capacity utilization, anticipated demand, the development of new technologies and global and regional economic conditions. Historically, these cycles typically last between 10-17 quarters, with each complete cycle made up of a contraction phase of about 4-6 quarters, followed by an expansion phase of approximately 6-11 quarters. We are currently in a longer-than-historical-average contraction cycle, which we believe is due primarily to a prolonged downturn in demand for personal computers and smartphones following a spike in demand for these products during the COVID pandemic and a reduction in anticipated growth rates for EVs. 
 
 SALES AND MARKETING 
 
 Due to the highly technical nature of our products, we market our products primarily by direct customer contact through our sales personnel and through a network of domestic and international independent sales representatives and distributors that specialize in semiconductor equipment and supplies. Our promotional activities include direct sales contacts, participation in trade shows, advertising and press releases in trade magazines and digital marketing including website SEO and pay-per-click advertising. 
 
 We use a mix of direct sales, representatives and distributors globally. Manufacturer representatives provide sales coverage in specific geographic regions and are paid a commission when products are sold. Sales to distributors are generally on terms comparable to sales to end-user customers, as our distributors generally quote their customers after first obtaining a quote from us and have an order from the end-user before placing an order with us. Our sales to distributors are not contingent on their future sales and do not include a general right of return. Historically, returns have been rare. Distributors of our semiconductor equipment do not stock a significant amount of our products, as the inventory they hold is generally limited to parts needed to provide timely repairs to customers. Our manufacturer representatives and distributors are closely managed by our global sales team. 
 
 Historically, each of our segments have been responsible for their own sales and marketing activities, including managing sales personnel and representative and distributor relationships, however, as we continue to refocus and grow our organization, we are developing opportunities for increased collaboration and teamwork across our divisions. These cross-segment collaboration opportunities will continue to be a focus at all levels and departments of our organization, as we believe they can lead to greater efficiencies while reducing operating costs. These efforts are further coordinated by our Vice President of Sales, who oversees all sales and marketing activities at each division.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING 
 
 The markets we serve are characterized by rapidly-evolving industry standards and technological change. To compete effectively, we must continually maintain or exceed the pace of such change by improving our products and our process technologies and by developing new technologies and products that are competitive based on price and performance. To assure that these technologies and products address current and future customer requirements, we obtain as much customer cooperation and input as possible, thus increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our research and development efforts. In addition, we look for strategic acquisitions that will provide us with new technologies to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate. 
 
 RD E expenses may vary from period to period depending on the engineering projects in process. Expenses related to engineers working on strategic projects or sustaining engineering projects are recorded in RD E. However, from time to time we add functionality to our products or develop new products during engineering and manufacturing to fulfill specifications in a customer s order, in which case the cost of development, along with other costs of the order, are charged to cost of goods sold. 
 
 In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded RD E expense of 4.2 million, 7.3 million and 6.4 million, respectively. We plan to continue to develop new products and invest in upgrades to existing products to stay competitive in the markets we serve. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 
 We compete in several distinct equipment markets for semiconductor devices, semiconductor substrates, MEMS, semiconductor packaging, and electronics assembly, as well as the markets for supplies used in power semiconductor applications. Each of these markets is highly competitive. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to continually improve our products, processes and services, as well as our ability to develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer technical and other requirements. Significant competitive factors for succeeding in these markets include the product s technical capability, productivity, cost-effectiveness, overall reliability, ease of use and maintenance, contamination and defect control and the level of technical service and support. 
 
 The Thermal Processing Solutions Market . Our thermal processing equipment primarily competes with equipment produced by other OEMs. Some of these manufacturers are well-established firms that are much larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of products. Additionally, these manufacturers may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. 
 
 Competitors of our horizontal diffusion furnaces include Centrotherm GmbH and CVD Equipment, Inc. Our principal competitors for printed circuit board assembly equipment and advanced semiconductor packaging vary by product application. The principal competitors for solder reflow systems are ITW/EAE Vitronics-Soltec, Heller, Folungwin, ERSA, Shenzhen JT Automation Equipment Co., Ltd. and Rehm. The principal competitors for advanced semiconductor packaging are ITW/EAE Vitronics-Soltec and Heller. Our in-line, controlled atmosphere furnaces compete primarily against products offered by Centrotherm and SierraTherm/Schmid Thermal Systems. We also face competition from emerging low-cost Asian manufacturers and other established European manufacturers. 
 
 Although price is a factor in buying decisions, we believe that technological leadership, process capability, throughput, safer designs, uptime, mean time-to-repair, cost of ownership and after-sale support have become increasingly important factors to purchasers of our products. As such, we believe we compete primarily on the basis of these criteria, rather than on the basis of price alone. 
 
 Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions Markets . Our CMP wafer carriers experience price competition from foreign manufacturers for which there is very little publicly available information. To maintain our competitive position, we work closely with customers to update our product line to keep pace with their requirements and provide a high level of quality and customer service. We also produce steel carriers, including insert carriers, on advanced laser-cutting tools, which reduces our costs and lead times and increases our control over quality.

Entrepix competes with other cleaning equipment providers including Screen and TEL with the OnTrak double sided scrubber. The OnTrak is normally paired with a stand-alone CMP tool to match the throughput. The OnTrak competes with other cleaning technologies in several other applications like SiC substrate manufacturing and others that require particle removal from the surface of a device wafer. 

Entrepix also competes with other companies specializing in refurbishment of older legacy CMP equipment. Competitors include Axus Technology and many other companies located in geographical regions such as China, South Korea and Taiwan. Entrepix s strategy consists of providing solutions for obsolete equipment for legacy 200mm, 300mm and smaller wafer processing equipment where support has been discontinued by the OEM. In addition, Entrepix provides support for their customers various wafer production and R D requirements in their class 1000 clean room foundry. 
 
 The competitive landscape in the substrate process chemical industry is varied, ranging from large multinational companies to small regional or regionally-focused companies. Intersurface Dynamics competes with much larger companies, such as Entegris, Inc. and Cabot.

We have a three-year agreement with this union, which expires on September 30, 2025. We expect this agreement to be renewed prior to expiration. We have never experienced a work stoppage or strike, and other than employees at the Carlisle facility, no other employees are represented by a union. At select business units, we have hired certain highly specialized employees under employment contracts that specify a term of employment, pay and other benefits. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
 
 Talent Acquisition and Retention 
 
 The future growth and success of our company largely depends on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified professionals. As part of our effort to do so, we offer competitive rewards, compensation and benefits, including an employee equity award program, performance-based bonuses, health and wellness benefits, retirement benefits, flexible schedules and holiday and paid time off. We understand that competitive compensation and benefits programs are important in retaining high-performing and qualified individuals. 
 
 We know that retention of high-performing employees benefits us and our customers. We are committed to helping our employees develop in their careers and thrive within the Company. Management provides regular performance reviews to ensure our employees are receiving timely and constructive feedback, as well as rewards based on their performance. These performance reviews also assess each employee s performance as it relates to Amtech s core values. We believe these programs and efforts contribute to attracting and retaining a talented and driven workforce. 
 
 Turnover 
 
 In 2024, our total employee turnover was 26.2 , of which approximately 36.5 was voluntary. Approximately 7.3 of voluntary turnover were employees that retired from the workforce. The average tenure of our employees is approximately 11 years and approximately 47.3 of our employees have been employed with us for more than 10 years. In 2023, our total employee turnover was 5.4 , of which approximately 70.8 was voluntary. Approximately 4.6 of voluntary turnover were employees that retired from the workforce. 
 
 Throughout 2024, we made targeted labor reductions as a result of our shift to contract manufacturing and the longer than expected slowdown in the broader semiconductor industry.

 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 
 There are many factors that affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, as well as the market price for our securities. The following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. We operate in a continually changing business environment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. Forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with all the other information in this Annual Report, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. 
 
 Risks Related to the Semiconductor Industry 
 
 16 

There is ongoing volatility in the semiconductor equipment industry. 
 
 The semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical and volatile. As such, demand for, and the profitability of, our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors, including the following: (a) changes in global and regional economic conditions; (b) the shift of semiconductor production to Asia, where there often is increased price competition; (c) tariffs, quotas and international trade barriers; (d) changes in capacity utilization and production volume of manufacturers of semiconductors, silicon wafers and MEMS; (e) the profitability and capital resources of those manufacturers; and (f) challenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base. 
 
 The purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on their capacity utilization, which changes when new facilities are put into production and with the level of demand for our products, as well as our customers capital expenditure budgets. Purchasing decisions are also impacted by changes in the economies of the countries served by our customers, as well as the state of the worldwide industries in which we operate or expect to operate in the future. The timing, length, and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict. Additionally, we generally experience a one-to-two quarter lag between upturns/downturns experienced by larger equipment manufacturers. 
 
 When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, our operating results are adversely affected. Cost reduction measures may be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, our operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions, effectively manage our supply chain, and motivate and retain key employees. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, our operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel and effectively manage our supply chain to meet customer demand, which may require additional liquidity. We can provide no assurance that we can timely and effectively respond to the industry cycles, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 
 The semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive and, because we are relatively small and have fewer financial and other resources compared to our competitors, we may not be able to compete successfully with them. 
 
 Our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully in these markets. Some of our competitors are diversified companies with extensive financial resources and research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities that are greater than ours. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products, some of which compete with the products and services we offer. These competitors may bundle their products in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer often at a lower price than ours and use innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. We also face competition from Chinese equipment manufacturers that may receive greater support than we do from Chinese customers and governmental agencies because they are locally based. In addition, our local Chinese competitors may offer lower prices and more liberal payment terms than ours. Loss of our competitive position due to any of these factors could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin, and market share, any of which would negatively affect our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 
 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund existing operations and our growth plan. 
 
 Our cash flows may be insufficient to provide adequate working capital in the future and we may require additional financing to fund existing operations as well as our growth plan. We paid off and terminated our existing credit facility with UMB Bank in September 2024. There is no assurance that we will be able to replace such facility or that any additional financing will be available if required, or, even if available, that it would not materially dilute the ownership 
 17 

percentage of our then existing shareholders, result in increased expenses or result in covenants or special rights that would restrict our operations. 
 
 We may not be able to manage our business successfully through severe business cycles. 
 
 We may be unable to successfully expand or contract our business to meet fluctuating demands. Market fluctuations place significant strain on our management, personnel, systems, and resources. To successfully manage our growth through such market fluctuations, we believe we must effectively: (a) maintain the appropriate number and mix of permanent, part-time, temporary and contract employees to meet the fluctuating demand for our products; (b) train, integrate and manage personnel, particularly process engineers, field service engineers, sales and marketing personnel, and financial and information technology personnel to maintain and improve skills and morale; (c) retain key management and augment our management team, particularly if we lose key members; (d) continue to enhance our customer resource and manufacturing management systems to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction and efficiencies, including inventory control; (e) manage our existing contract manufacturers and those we engage in the future, (f) implement and improve existing and new administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls; (g) expand and upgrade our technological capabilities; and (h) manage multiple relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. 
 
 We may encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by rapidly changing business cycles. If we are unable to effectively manage our business through these cycles, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, develop new technologies and other products, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures. 
 
 Our inability to attract, train and retain effective employees and management could harm our business. 
 
 Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and certain other employees, many of whom have many years of experience with us and would be extremely difficult to replace. We must also attract and retain experienced and highly skilled engineering, sales and marketing and managerial personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense in our industry, and we may not be successful in hiring and retaining these people. If we lost the services of our executive officers or our other highly qualified and experienced employees or cannot attract and retain other qualified personnel, our business could suffer as a result of less effective management due to loss of accumulated knowledge of our business or through less successful products due to a reduced ability to design, manufacture and market our products. 
 
 We may be unable to implement certain business strategies and any issue with the pursuit of such business strategies could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 We may from time to time determine to implement business strategies and restructuring initiatives in order to remain competitive. Because our strategies and restructuring activities may involve changes to many aspects of our business, including the location of our production facilities, the use of contract manufactures, and the potential exit of certain product lines and businesses, our ability to successfully do so depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we are not able to effectively manage or efficiently implement these strategies and/or restructuring initiatives for reasons within or outside of our control, then our business operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 In addition, implementation of a business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations. For example, the contingent risks associated with outsourcing certain of our existing manufacturing operations to third parties, as is the case with our use of third party manufacturers, primarily in Canada and Mexico, could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or could disrupt our existing operations, especially if a contract manufacturer is unable to meet its commitments under any agreements or encounters financial difficulty. Furthermore, our efforts to outsource certain of our manufacturing operations may require additional management time and effort to implement successfully, and lead to higher than anticipated capital expenditures. 
 
 The failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions or strategies could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, even if we fully execute and implement these activities, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could 
 18 

materially adversely impact our profitability and business, including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position. To the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other anticipated benefits of strategy or restructuring initiatives, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
 
 We may be unable to successfully acquire and integrate new operations, which could cause our business to suffer. 
 
 We continually evaluate potential acquisitions and consider acquisitions an important part of our future growth strategy. In the past, we have made acquisitions of, or significant investments in, other businesses with synergistic products, services and technologies and plan to continue to do so in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. 
 
 Additionally, we cannot predict if or when acquisitions will be completed, and we may face significant competition for acquisition targets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including: (a) difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, management information systems, products and personnel of the acquired companies; (b) diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business; (c) loss of key employees; (d) difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and where our competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; (e) difficulties in complying with regulations, such as antitrust and environmental regulations, and managing risks related to an acquired business; (f) an inability to timely obtain financing, including any amendments required to our existing financing agreement; (g) an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; (h) undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition; and (i) loss of key customers or suppliers. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition. 
 
 Our reliance on sales to a few major customers, often on credit terms, places us at financial risk. 
 
 We currently sell to a relatively small number of customers and expect to do so for the foreseeable future. Therefore, our operating results depend on the ability of these customers to sell products that require our equipment in their manufacturing operations. Many of our customer relationships have developed over a short period of time and certain ones are in the early stages of development. The loss of sales to any of these customers would have a significant negative impact on our business. Additionally, our customers may cancel their agreements or orders with us if we fail to meet certain product specifications, materially breach agreements or encounter insolvency or bankruptcy. Any such cancellations may result in inventory that we may not be able to quickly resell. They also may seek to renegotiate the terms of current agreements or renewals. We cannot be certain our existing customers will generate significant revenue for us in the future or that these new customer relationships will be maintained or continue to develop. If we are unable to maintain or expand our customer base, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue. 
 
 In addition to having a relatively limited number of customers, we manufacture a limited number of products for each of our customers. If we lose any of our largest customers (as we have in the past from time to time), experience a significant reduction in sales to any such customers or no longer manufacture a particular product line for one of our largest customers, we will experience a significant reduction in our revenue. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, one Thermal Processing Solutions customer represented 12 of our accounts receivable. A concentration of our receivables from one or a small number of customers places us at risk. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results. We attempt to manage this credit risk by requiring significant partial payments prior to shipment, where appropriate, and by actively monitoring collections. We also require letters of credit from certain customers depending on the size of the order, type of customer or its creditworthiness and its country of domicile. Our major customers may seek and, on occasion, may receive pricing, payment or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us than the current terms we customarily obtain. If any one or more of our major customers were to seek to re-negotiate their agreements on more favorable terms, or not pay us or continue business with us, it could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs. 
 
 Our business depends on timely supply of parts, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. Some key parts to our products are subject to long lead times and/or are obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, file for bankruptcy protection or possibly cease operations. We also may experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services or increased costs as a result of any of the following: (a) the failure or inability of suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective and timely basis; (b) volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements; (c) difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals; (d) information technology or infrastructure failures; and (e) natural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where we conduct manufacturing operations. 
 
 We use third parties for certain of our manufacturing activities. If our contract manufacturers do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may incur additional costs to correct errors or fulfill customer demand. Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or an impact on employee morale. Our operations may also be negatively impacted if any of these contract manufacturers do not have the financial capability to meet our growing needs. 
 
 There are also inherent execution risks in starting up a new factory or expanding production capacity, whether one of our own factories or that of our contract manufacturers, as well as risks to moving production to different contract manufacturers, which could increase costs and reduce our operating results. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we opened a new SiC consumables facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina to complement our manufacturing facility in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. We are also working with contract manufacturing facilities in Canada and Mexico. The establishment and operation of new manufacturing facilities or contract manufacturing involves significant risks and challenges, some of which we have experienced and may experience in the future, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) design and construction delays and cost overruns; (b) issues in installing and qualifying new equipment and ramping production; (c) poor production process yields and reduced quality control; and (d) insufficient personnel with requisite expertise and experience to operate a manufacturing facility for the products we manufacture. 
 
 Because we depend on revenue from international customers, our business may be adversely affected by changes in the economies and policies of the countries or regions in which we do business. 
 
 In 2024, 59 of our net revenue came from customers outside of North America as follows: Asia - 43 (including China - 20 , Malaysia - 12 and Taiwan - 8 ); and Europe - 16 (including Germany - 6 and Czech Republic - 3 ). 
 
 Each geographic region in which we, our customers, and our suppliers operate exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period. Our business and results of operations could be negatively affected by periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues and political, social and military instability in countries such as China, Russia, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Ukraine and possibly elsewhere. In addition, we face competition from a number of suppliers based in Asia that have certain advantages over suppliers from outside of Asia. These advantages include lower operating, shipping and regulatory costs, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and other government policies that favor local suppliers. Additionally, the marketing and sale of our products to international markets expose us to a number of risks, including the following: (a) increased costs associated with maintaining the ability to understand the local markets and follow their trends and customs, as well as developing and maintaining an effective marketing and distributing presence; (b) limitations on our ability to require advance payments from our customers; (c) difficulty in providing customer service and support in local markets; (d) difficulty in staffing and managing overseas operations; (e) longer sales cycles and collection periods; (f) fewer or weaker legal protections for our intellectual property rights; (g) failure to develop appropriate risk management and internal control structures tailored to overseas operations; (h) difficulty and costs relating to compliance with the different or changing commercial and legal requirements of our overseas markets; (i) fluctuations 
 20 

in foreign currency exchange and interest rates; (j) failure to obtain or maintain certifications for our products or services in these markets; and (k) international trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses. 
 
 Our business may be adversely affected by significant exchange rate fluctuations. 
 
 Though our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations, there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future. Such risk includes possible losses due to currency exchange rate fluctuations, future prohibitions against repatriation of earnings, or proceeds from disposition of investments. 
 
 We are exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy. 
 
 Uncertain global economic conditions and slowing growth in China, Europe and the United States, along with difficulties in the financial markets, national debt concerns and government austerity measures in certain regions, pose challenges to the industries in which we operate. Related factors, including unemployment, inflation and fuel prices, exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause our customers to delay, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services. These actions may, in turn, reduce our net sales, reduce backlog, and negatively affect our ability to convert backlog to sales. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability also may cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can result in lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for us. These conditions may similarly affect key suppliers, impairing their ability to deliver parts and potentially causing delays or added costs for delivery of our products. In addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, and/or modify our business model, which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery. If we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from these uncertain macroeconomic and industry conditions, or to difficulties in the financial markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 If we fail to maintain optimal inventory levels, our inventory obsolescence costs could increase, our liquidity could be significantly reduced, or our revenue could decrease. 
 
 While we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully, meet our customers demands, and mitigate the possible impact of supply chain issues, accumulating excess inventory may have a significant unfavorable impact on our operating results and financial condition. Changing customer demands, supplier lead times and uncertainty surrounding new product launches expose us to risks associated with excess inventory or shortages. Our products are manufactured using a wide variety of purchased parts and raw materials and we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet the demand for the products we sell, which can change rapidly and unexpectedly. During peak years of our business, increases in demand for capital equipment result in longer lead times for many important system components. Future increases in demand could cause delays in meeting the shipment requirements or expectations of our customers. Because of the variability and uniqueness of customer orders, we seek to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing. However, long lead times for important system components during industry upturns sometimes require us to carry higher levels of inventory and make larger purchase commitments than we otherwise would make. We may be unable to sell sufficient quantities of products if market demand changes, resulting in increased risk of excess inventory that could lead to obsolescence or reduced liquidity as we fulfill our purchase commitments. Conversely, if we do not have a sufficient inventory of a product to fulfill customer orders, we may lose orders or customers, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to accurately predict market demand to avoid inventory shortages or build inventories and issue purchase commitments in excess of our current requirements. 
 
 21 

Supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. 
 
 We use numerous suppliers covering a wide range of materials and services in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components. Key vendors include suppliers of controllers, quartz and silicon carbide for our diffusion systems, steel mills capable of producing the types of steel to the tolerances needed for our wafer carriers, an injection molding machine that molds plastic inserts into our steel carriers, an adhesive manufacturer that supplies the critical glue and a pad supplier that produces a unique material used in the manufacture of our polishing templates. We also rely on third parties for certain machined parts, steel frames and metal panels and other components used particularly in the assembly of our production equipment. Although we strive to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, we procure some key parts from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Thus, at times, certain parts may not be available in sufficient quantities, or on a timely and cost-efficient basis, to adequately meet our needs and the needs of our customers. 
 
 In the event of supplier capacity constraints, production disruptions, or failure to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost or performance factors, we may seek to transfer our business to alternative sourcing which could lead to further delays, additional costs or other difficulties. If, in the future, we do not receive, in a timely and cost-effective manner, a sufficient quantity and quality of parts to meet our production requirements, our business, financial position and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Our income taxes are subject to variables beyond our control. 
 
 Our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by conditions affecting income taxes which are outside our control. Examples of the potential uncontrollable circumstances that could affect our tax rate are as follows: 
 
 We sell and operate globally in the United States, Europe and Asia. Disagreement could occur on the jurisdiction of income and taxation among different governmental tax authorities. Potential areas of dispute may include transfer pricing, intercompany charges and intercompany balances. 

We are subject to a Chinese withholding tax on certain non-tangible charges made under our transfer pricing agreements. The interpretation of what charges are subject to the tax and when the liability for the tax occurs has varied and could change in the future. 

Tax rates may increase, or new tax rates may be implemented (i.e., a global minimum rate), and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. 

Natural disasters, outbreaks of infectious diseases, terrorist attacks, wars and threats of war may negatively impact our operations, revenue, costs, and stock price. 
 
 Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, severe weather conditions, outbreaks of infectious diseases in addition to COVID-19 or other catastrophic events may severely affect our operations or those of our suppliers and customers. Acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response or connection to them, including potential future terrorist attacks, rumors or threats of war, actual military conflicts or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign customers or suppliers, may negatively impact our operations by causing, among other things, delays, or losses in the delivery of supplies or finished goods and decreased sales of our products. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease and/or result in increased volatility in the worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in economic recession either globally or in the markets in which we operate. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 
 We maintain cash deposits in excess of federally insured limits. Adverse developments affecting financial institutions, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance . 
 
 We maintain domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured banks that exceed the FDIC insurance limits. We also maintain cash deposits in foreign banks where we operate, some of which are not insured or are only partially insured by the FDIC or similar agencies. Bank failures, events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance, or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, or concerns or rumors about such events, may lead to liquidity constraints. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions in the financial 
 22 

or credit markets impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable insurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or applicable foreign government, or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions, or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis. 
 
 We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not remediated, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. 
 
 During the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2023, we identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of user access, segregation of duties, and program change-management over information technology systems that support substantially all of the Company s financial reporting processes. This resulted in our inability to segregate user duties within the Company s business processes. A substantial portion of the Company's controls are dependent upon the information derived from the information technology systems and therefore the dependent controls were concluded to be ineffective. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Additionally, in the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2023, we identified a material weakness because we did not design and maintain adequate internal controls over non-routine and complex transactions, including the preparation and review of the third-party service provider valuation reports in the areas of goodwill and intangible assets. 
 
 In fiscal 2024, our management, under the oversight of our Audit Committee, began designing and implementing measures designed to remediate the control deficiencies contributing to these material weaknesses. The material weaknesses are considered remediated once all necessary internal controls have been implemented, tested and determined to be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time, which we concluded occurred as of September 30, 2024. Notwithstanding the remediation of the control deficiencies, we cannot assure you that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements with the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, could be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition. 
 
 Continued changes in corporate governance requirements, policies and practices may impact our business . 
 
 Corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices continue to evolve based upon continuing legislative action, SEC rulemaking and policy positions taken by large institutional stockholders and proxy advisors. As a result, the number of rules, regulations and standards applicable to us may become more burdensome to comply with, could increase scrutiny of our practices and policies by these or other groups and increase our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time management must devote to governance and compliance activities. For example, the SEC has recently adopted rules requiring that issuers provide significantly increased disclosures concerning cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and incident reporting and adopt more stringent executive compensation clawback policies. Increasing regulatory burdens and corporate governance requirements could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board and qualified executive officers.

Risks Related to Regulations and Litigation 
 
 We are subject to various laws and regulations, including recent pronouncements related to laws and regulations governing climate related disclosures, cybersecurity, privacy, anti-corruption and the environment. Obligations and liabilities under these laws and regulations may materially harm our business. 
 
 Our operations are subject to an array of governmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including taxation policies, governance and audit requirements, employment and labor laws, environmental regulations, transportation regulations, import and export regulations and tariffs, possible foreign exchange restrictions and international monetary fluctuations. Noncompliance with applicable regulations, implementation of new regulations or modifications to existing regulations may increase costs of compliance, require a termination of certain activities or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Climate Disclosure, Cybersecurity and Other Pronouncements - Pronouncements by the SEC, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, and from the state of California, among others, related to antitrust, climate related disclosures, cybersecurity and privacy could have the impact of increasing Company compliance costs, increasing potential liability to the Company as a result of frivolous lawsuits, or place the Company in a position of not knowing when or if the laws are settled in a particular area in order for the Company to effectively comply. 
 
 Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations - We are a U.S.-based multinational company with extensive operations in Asia and elsewhere. We operate in several high-risk jurisdictions, including, but not limited to China. Various U.S. and certain non-U.S. anti-corruption/anti-bribery and other international trade laws and regulations apply to us and our businesses. These laws and regulations may include, among others, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. Travel Act, domestic anti-corruption laws such as 18 U.S.C. 201, the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. 730 et seq.), U.S. sanctions contained in 31 C.F.R. Parts 500-599, the U.S. International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the U.S. Trading with the Enemy Act, the International Boycott Provisions (Section 999) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the UK Bribery Act 2010, the UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and certain other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-kickback, anti-fraud, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing, anti-narcotics, anti-boycott, export control, sanctions, embargo, import control, customs, tax, insider trading, insurance, banking, false claims, anti-racketeering, and other laws, regulations, decrees, government or executive orders, or judicial or administrative decisions or determinations to the extent applicable. 
 
 These laws and regulations are interpreted very broadly and will impact and raise legal compliance risks for our business in the various jurisdictions where we operate. Violations of any of these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. 
 
 Anti-corruption/anti-bribery and the other laws and regulations referenced above are actively enforced by U.S. and other government agencies. Among various matters, anti-corruption/anti-bribery laws prohibit our companies, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and business partners, as well as third parties acting for or on our behalf, from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or accepting, whether directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage vendors and third-party business partners to sell our products or services and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated organizations. These activities raise our anti-corruption/anti-bribery risk exposure. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our officers, directors, employees, and business partners, as well as the conduct of third parties acting for or on our behalf, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of their misconduct. The application of these laws to us also may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar laws/regulations. 
 
 Environmental Laws and Regulations - We are subject to a variety of national, state, regional and local environmental laws and regulations. Among other things, these laws and regulations impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, regulated materials and waste and impose liabilities for the costs of investigating and cleaning up, and damages resulting from, present and past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. In the ordinary 
 24 

course of business, we use and generate substances that are regulated or may be hazardous under environmental laws. We have an inherent risk of liability under environmental laws and regulations, both with respect to ongoing operations and with respect to contamination that may have occurred in the past on our properties or as a result of our operations. While we endeavor to comply with all regulatory requirements, from time to time, our operations or conditions on properties that we have acquired have resulted in liabilities under these environmental laws. We may in the future incur material costs to comply with environmental laws or sustain material liabilities from claims concerning noncompliance or contamination. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all the costs relating to any contamination at, or migration to or from, our or our predecessors' past or present facilities. These laws often impose liability even if the owner, operator or lessor did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. While we maintain certain related insurance coverages, we have no reserves for any such liabilities. 
 
 We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. If we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws, regulations, or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials. 
 
 We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, or what environmental conditions may be found to exist at our facilities or at third party sites for which we may be liable. Enactment of stricter laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the requirement to undertake the investigation or remediation of currently unknown environmental contamination at sites we own or third-party sites may require us to make additional expenditures, some of which could be material. Responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. The impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. 
 
 The United States could withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, or change tariff, trade, or tax provisions related to the global manufacturing and sales of our products in ways that we currently cannot predict. 
 
 A portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including China, Malaysia and Taiwan. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, and we also rely on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market and sell our products globally. Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions could impact our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Political and economic instability, geopolitical conflicts, political unrest, civil strife, terrorist activity, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation, nationalism and other economic or political uncertainties in the United States or internationally could interrupt and negatively affect the sale of our products or other business operations. Any negative sentiment toward the United States as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business. In addition, changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business. U.S. presidential administrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations to adapt to or comply with any such changes. Changes or proposed changes in U.S. or other countries' trade policies may result in restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. Tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. Further, any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the United States or in other countries could affect the trade environment. Amtech, like many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the United States and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we conduct operations, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the announced and other proposed tariffs on products that we import from China, and we may experience a material 
 25 

increase in the cost of our products, which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors. 
 
 These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United States. Any of these factors, or any changes to U.S. corporate tax policies related to international commerce, could depress economic activity and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to expanded export control restrictions adopted by the U.S. Department of Commerce s Bureau of Industry and Security that could negatively impact our business in China. 
 
 The United States and certain other countries in which we do business maintain government controls that may restrict our ability to import or export our products and services or increase the cost of our operations through the imposition of tariffs, new controls, outright bans, or otherwise, that could harm our business and negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has added and continues to add numerous China-based entities to the U.S. Entity List, including many entities active in the semiconductor industry in China, restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without an export license. Even if we apply for licenses to sell our products or provide services to companies on the U.S. Entity List, there can be no assurance that licenses will be granted. In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce has imposed new export licensing requirements on exports to China-based customers engaged in development or production in China of advanced semiconductors and supercomputers, military end uses, support for military end users, or where Commerce has determined there is a risk of diversion to a military end use, as well as requiring our customers to obtain export licenses when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to manufacture products connected to certain entities on the U.S. Entity List. The U.S. Department of Commerce has also imposed restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons supporting or facilitating transactions with projects in China for the development or production of advanced semiconductors and supercomputers. To date, these new rules have not significantly impacted our operations, but we are continually monitoring their impact. If additional companies are added to the U.S. Entity List, or other licensing requirements or restrictions are imposed, thereby limiting our ability to sell our products or services to other customers in China, our business could be significantly harmed. Similar actions by the U.S. government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers. 
 
 We face a risk of product liability claims or other litigation, which could be expensive and may divert management s attention from running our business. 
 
 Amtech and our subsidiaries are defendants from time to time in actions for matters arising out of our business operations. The manufacture and sale of our products, which, in our customers operations, involve toxic materials and robotic machinery, involve the risk of product liability claims. In addition, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of our customer. Our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products if a successful product liability claim or series of product liability claims were brought against us. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our accrued warranty costs amounted to 0.6 million and 1.0 million, respectively. Our assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our products may not be accurate, and because our products have relatively long warranty periods, we cannot assure you that the amount of accrued warranty by us for our products will be adequate considering the actual performance of our products or that we won't experience higher than expected warranty claims. If we experience a significant increase in warranty claims, we may incur significant repair and replacement costs associated with such claims. Furthermore, widespread product underperformances or failures will damage our reputation and customer relationships and may cause our sales to decline, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We also may be involved in other legal proceedings or claims and experience threats of legal action from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. For example, securities class action litigation is often brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities or in connection with strategic transactions. We may in the future be the target of securities litigation due to volatility in the market price of our common stock or for other reasons. Any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management. 
 26 

Where appropriate, we intend to vigorously defend all claims. However, any actual or threatened claims, even if not meritorious or material, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. The continued defense of these claims and other types of lawsuits could divert management s attention away from running our business. In addition, amounts required to be paid in settlement of any claims, and the legal fees and other costs associated with their defense or settlement, cannot be estimated and could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our financial condition. 
 
 Social and environmental responsibility regulations, policies and provisions, as well as customer and investor demands, may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors. 
 With the increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry, a number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions. We may face difficulties in satisfying these customers demands, which may harm our sales and operating results. 
 
 Many investors also expect companies to disclose corporate social and environmental policies, practices and metrics under voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks. We periodically communicate our strategies, goals and targets related to our corporate social and environmental policies and programs. These strategies, goals and targets, and their underlying assumptions and projections, reflect our current plans and aspirations, but we may be unable to achieve them. It is also possible that our investors might not be satisfied with our policies, programs, goals, performance and related disclosures, or the speed of their adoption, implementation and measurable success, or that we have adopted such policies, programs and commitments at all. 
 
 In addition, unfavorable ratings or assessment of our corporate social and environmental policies and programs, including our compliance with certain voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Research and Development and Intellectual Property Activities 
 
 We may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology needed to meet customer requirements. 
 
 Success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions. For example, the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size of semiconductor devices. This trend and other evolving customer needs require us to continually respond with new product developments. Technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products, or new uses for existing products, that successfully address changing customer needs and gain market acceptance. We also must manufacture these new products in a timely and cost-effective manner. To realize future growth through technical innovations in the semiconductor industry, we must acquire the technology through product development, merger and acquisition activity or through the licensing of products from our technology partners. Potential disruptive technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business if we do not successfully develop and introduce new products, technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways of reducing the cost to produce them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements. 
 
 Third parties may violate our proprietary rights, in which we have made significant investments, resulting in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation. 
 
 Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. We own various U.S. and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies. Protecting and defending our patents domestically, and especially internationally, is costly. In addition, the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive. Therefore, we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will result in issued patents, or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop 
 27 

technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own or license. In addition, the patent for the technology that we license and use in our manufacture of insert carriers has expired, which, along with the other risks related to our patents described above, may have the effect of diminishing or eliminating any competitive advantage we may have with respect to our manufacturing process. 
 
 We also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation. We can give no assurance, however, that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or will successfully deter infringement by third parties. 
 
 We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures. We also maintain exclusive and non-exclusive licenses with third parties for the technology used in certain products. However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. In addition, the laws of certain territories, such as China, in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. 
 
 We may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages. 
 
 From time to time, we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. We cannot assure that we will prevail in these actions, or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third-party trade secrets, infringement by us of third-party patents and trademarks or the validity of our patents, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party s patent) to the party claiming infringement, incur costs to develop non-infringing technology, stop selling or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property, or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management s attention from our business. Our failure to successfully defend against infringement claims, or to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis, could have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 
 Our stock price may be volatile. 
 
 Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of fluctuations in our revenue, earnings and margins over the past few years, and variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts. For example, during the two-year period ended September 30, 2024, the price of our common stock has ranged from 11.98 to 3.37. If our future operating results or margins are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors, our stock price will likely decline. 
 
 Speculation and opinions in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations or significant transactions can also cause changes in our stock price. Competition in some of the markets we address such as the SiC industry, and the effect of tariffs or COVID-19 or other pandemics on our business, may have a dramatic effect on our stock price. 
 
 Additional factors may affect our stock price, including sales of our common stock by us or our existing shareholders as well as changes to the coverage and/or rating of our stock by securities analysts. 
 
 Our officers, directors and largest shareholders could choose to act in their best interests and not necessarily those of our other shareholders. 
 
 Our directors, executive officers and holders of ten percent or more of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates represent a significant portion of our common stock held as of September 30, 2024, and, therefore, could 
 28 

have significant influence over our management and corporate policies. These shareholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our shareholders, including the election of our directors and approval of business combinations, and could potentially initiate or delay, deter or prevent a change of control. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of these shareholders may conflict with the interests of Amtech or those of our other shareholders, and these shareholders may cause us to take actions that align with their interests. Should conflicts of interest arise, we can provide no assurance that these shareholders would act in the best interests of our other shareholders or that any conflicts of interest would be resolved in a manner favorable to our other shareholders. In addition, involvement of certain activist shareholders may impact our ability to recruit and retain talent or otherwise distract management or make decisions that we believe are in the long-term interest of all shareholders. 
 
 Shareholder activists could cause a disruption to our business. 
 
 An activist investor may indicate disagreement with our strategic direction or capital allocation policies and may seek representation on our Board of Directors. Our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected and may result in, among other things: (a) increased operating costs, including increased legal expenses, insurance, administrative expenses and associated costs incurred in connection with director election contests; (b) uncertainties as to our future direction, which could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and could make it more difficult to attract, retain, or motivate qualified personnel, and strain relationships with investors and customers; and (c) reduction or delay in our ability to effectively execute our current business strategy and to implement new strategies. 
 
 There are provisions in our corporate governing documents that could make an acquisition of the Company more difficult and limit attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management. 
 
 Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, as well as Arizona law, contain provisions that may have the effect of deterring takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management that a shareholder might deem to be in his or her best interest. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that: (a) authorize blank check preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors without shareholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; (b) specify that special meetings of our shareholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, the Chairperson of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer, or a majority of the Board of Directors; (c) provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, though not less than a quorum; (d) specify that only our Board of Directors may change the size of our Board of Directors; (e) establish an advance notice procedure for shareholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our shareholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors; and (f) expressly authorize our Board of Directors to modify, alter or repeal our bylaws. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management or our Board of Directors. 
 
 In addition, because we are incorporated in the State of Arizona, we are governed by the provisions of the Arizona Revised Statutes Section 10-274, which prohibits certain business combinations between us and certain interested shareholders unless specified conditions are met. These provisions may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Amtech. Any provision of our amended and restated articles of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Arizona law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.

 IT EM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 
 Our Board recognizes the importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees. Our Board, through the Audit Committee, oversees our cybersecurity program as part of our enterprise-wide approach to risk management. Our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices are fully 
 29 

integrated into our risk management approach and are based on recognized frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the International Organization for Standardization and other applicable industry standards. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a comprehensive, cross-functional approach that is focused on preserving the confidentiality, security and availability of the information that we collect and store by identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur. 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 
 As one of the critical elements of enterprise-wide approach to risk management, our cybersecurity program is focused on the following key areas: 
 
 Governance : As discussed in more detail under the heading Governance below, our cybersecurity program is led by our IT Director, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer and is responsible for publishing cybersecurity policies and standards, conducting annual risk assessments and maintaining our compliance. Our IT Director leads our information technology team and regularly reports to our Audit Committee. 
 
 Collaboration : We have implemented a comprehensive, cross-functional approach to identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and incidents, while also implementing controls and procedures that provide for the prompt escalation of certain cybersecurity incidents so that decisions regarding the public disclosure and reporting of such incidents can be made by management in a timely manner. We work with third-party firms to monitor our cybersecurity environment and report findings to executive leadership, internal audit and the Audit Committee regularly. 
 
 Technical Safeguards : We deploy technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality and access controls, which are evaluated and improved through vulnerability assessments, certifications, audits and cybersecurity threat intelligence. 
 
 Incident Response and Recovery Planning : We have established and maintained comprehensive incident response and recovery plans that fully address our response to a cybersecurity incident, and such plans are tested and evaluated on a regular basis. 
 
 Third-Party Risk Management : We maintain a comprehensive, risk-based approach to identifying and overseeing cybersecurity risks presented by third parties, including vendors, service providers and other external users of our systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting those third-party systems. Additionally, we have in place insurance coverage designed to provide coverage in connection with cybersecurity breaches, provided, however, that such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all insured losses or all types of claims that may arise. 
 
 Education and Awareness : We provide regular, mandatory training for personnel regarding cybersecurity threats as a means to equip our personnel with effective tools to address cybersecurity threats, and to communicate our evolving information security policies, standards, processes and practices. 
 
 We engage in the periodic assessment and testing of our policies, standards, processes and practices that are designed to address cybersecurity threats and incidents. These efforts include a wide range of activities, including audits, assessments, vulnerability testing and other exercises focused on evaluating the effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures and planning. We regularly engage third parties to perform assessments on our cybersecurity measures, including information security maturity assessments, audits and independent reviews of our information security control environment and operating effectiveness. The results of such assessments, audits and reviews are reported to our Board and Audit Committee by our IT Director based on materiality. We adjust our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices as necessary based on the information provided by these assessments, audits and reviews. 
 
 Governance 
 
 30 

Our Board, through the Audit Committee, oversees our enterprise-wide approach to risk management, including the risks arising from cybersecurity threats. Our Audit Committee regularly receives presentations and reports on cybersecurity risks, which address a wide range of topics, including recent developments, evolving standards, vulnerability assessments, third-party and independent reviews, the threat environment, technological trends and information security considerations arising with respect to our peers and third parties. Our Audit Committee also receives prompt and timely information regarding any cybersecurity incident that meets established reporting thresholds, as well as ongoing updates regarding any such incident until it has been addressed. On an annual basis, our Audit Committee discusses our Company s approach to cybersecurity risk management with management. 
 
 Our Audit Committee, in connection with management led by our Chief Financial Officer, works collaboratively across our Company to implement a program designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats and to promptly respond to any cybersecurity incidents in accordance with our incident response and recovery plans. To facilitate the success of our cybersecurity risk management program, multidisciplinary teams are deployed to address cybersecurity threats and respond to cybersecurity incidents. Through ongoing communications with these teams, our Audit Committee monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents in real-time and report such threats and incidents to management when appropriate. 
 
 Our IT Director has served in various roles in technology leadership for more than 20 years, including cybersecurity. With an undergraduate degree in Information Systems, an MBA, and certification as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) from ISC2, the IT Director plays a key role in managing risks at our company. This includes risks arising from cybersecurity threats, drawing on extensive experience gained from similar companies and leadership positions across the technology sector. Although the Company does not have both a Chief Technology Officer or a Vice President of Security, the IT Director s expertise ensures robust risk management practices are in place. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and IT Director each hold undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in their respective fields, and each has experience managing risks at our Company and at similar companies including risks arising from cybersecurity threats. 
 
 Cybersecurity Threats 
 
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not believe that any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previous cybersecurity incidents, are reasonably likely to have a material effect on us, our business strategy, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

 MARKET INFORMATION 
 
 Our common stock, par value 0.01 per share (Common Stock), is trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol ASYS. The stock price details can be obtained from the Nasdaq website at www.nasdaq.com . 
 
 ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 
 Share Repurchase Programs 
 
 On February 7, 2023, the Board approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 5 million of our outstanding Common Stock over a one-year period, commencing on February 10, 2023. Repurchases under the program will be made in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means in compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission; however, we have no obligation to repurchase shares and the timing, actual number, and value of shares to be repurchased is subject to management s discretion and will depend on our stock price and other market conditions. We may, in the sole discretion of the Board, terminate the repurchase program at any time while it is in effect. Repurchased shares may be retired or kept in treasury for further issuance. During the year ended September 30, 2023, did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. 
 
 On February 10, 2022, the Board approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 5 million of our outstanding Common Stock over a one-year period, commencing on February 16, 2022. Repurchases under the program will be made in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means in compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC; however, we have no obligation to repurchase shares and the timing, actual number, and value of shares to be repurchased is subject to management s discretion and will depend on our stock price and other market conditions. We may, in the sole discretion of the Board, terminate the repurchase program at any time while it is in effect. Repurchased shares may be retired or kept in treasury for further issuance. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased 143,430 shares of our Common Stock on the open market at a total cost of approximately 1.4 million (an average price of 9.78 per share). All repurchased shares have been retired. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any of our equity securities nor did we sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As of September 30, 2024, there are no amounts authorized for repurchase. 
 
 HOLDERS 
 
 As of November 29, 2024, there were 279 shareholders of record of our Common Stock. Based upon a recent survey of brokers, we estimate there were approximately an additional 911 beneficial shareholders who held shares in brokerage or other investment accounts as of that date. 
 
 DIVIDENDS 
 
 We have never paid dividends on our Common Stock. Our present policy is to apply cash to investments in product development and upgrades, acquisitions or expansion, and debt repayments; consequently, we do not expect to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. However, once the above priorities have been met, we will evaluate the returning of capital to shareholders, as we have done in the past. 
 
 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 
 There were no unregistered sales of equity securities in fiscal 2024.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those described in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please refer to page 5 for further information regarding forward-looking statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors for a description of our risk factors. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We provide equipment, consumables and services for semiconductor wafer fabrication and device packaging. Our products are used in fabricating semiconductor devices, such as silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon (Si) power devices, digital and analog devices, power electronic packages, advanced semiconductor packages and electronic assemblies. We sell these products to semiconductor device and module manufacturers worldwide, particularly in Asia, North America and Europe. 
 
 We operate in two reportable segments, based primarily on the industries they serve: (i) Thermal Processing Solutions (formerly called Semiconductor) and (ii) Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions (formerly called Material and Substrate). Our thermal processing solutions include reflow equipment for chip packaging and electronic assembly, diffusion furnaces and furnaces used to produce ceramic based power semiconductor packages and passive electronic components. Our semiconductor fabrication solutions include consumables, equipment and services for wafer polishing, cleaning, slicing and dicing. 
 
 The markets we serve are historically cyclical, but not seasonal, with constantly evolving technical requirements and can be subject to tariffs and sourcing restrictions driven by geopolitical tensions. Our revenue is impacted by these broad industry trends. 
 
 Growth and Investment Strategy 
 
 We believe there are three key secular trends that are key to our future growth: 
 
 Advanced Mobility - Advanced Mobility encompasses both the development and adoption of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, including both EV and HEV, as well as advanced automotive electronics including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), infotainment and telematics. Our products intersect these markets in multiple ways: CMP consumables and wafer cleaning systems for the SiC substrates used in the EV power invertors; thermal processing systems for producing EV battery cooling systems and ceramic substrates for HEV power semiconductor packaging; and reflow ovens for ADAS, infotainment and telematics component assemblies. 

Supply Chain Resiliency - There is a global trend of creating supply chain resiliency by expanding and/or relocating operations outside of mainland China. These new facilities will create demand for new equipment and services in growing regions like Mexico and Southeast Asia. 

Artificial Intelligence - With Artificial Intelligence (AI), our reflow oven systems are the favored choice for Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test Services (OSATS) providers who perform advanced packaging of the AI chips. 

We continue to invest in research and development, including the introduction of our next-generation reflow platform, Aurora, in 2023. Historically, we have grown our business primarily through acquisitions, including the businesses that currently comprise our two reportable segments in the Thermal Processing Solutions and Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions industries: BTU, PR Hoffman, Intersurface Dynamics and Entrepix. Our 2023 acquisition of Entrepix bolstered our offerings in the CMP technology space and incorporated wafer cleaning into our existing capital 
 34 

equipment product lines. We continue to believe this inorganic growth strategy is the backbone of who Amtech is as a company, we also have a complimentary strategy of pursuing organic growth, particularly during times when we lacked sufficient capital resources to pursue growth through acquisitions. We will continue to pursue acquisitions to supplement organic growth and have added market development resources globally to accelerate organic growth. 
 
 In June 2022, we completed the sale of the real property where our manufacturing facility in Massachusetts is located. In connection with this sale, we entered into a two-year leaseback of the facility. This sale-leaseback transaction resulted in a net cash inflow of approximately 14.9 million, after repayment of the existing mortgage and settlement of related sale expenses. In September 2023, we signed a lease for a new location with less square footage and completed the move to this location in June 2024. As we expand our use of contract manufacturers, we will continue to look for ways to reduce our real estate footprint. In March 2024, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters real property in Arizona. The sale resulted in a net cash inflow of approximately 2.5 million, after settlement of related sale expenses. Following the closing of this transaction, we entered into a lease agreement for a new office for our corporate headquarters, which commenced during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. In addition, we are evaluating business continuity and resiliency within our operations, our management information systems, and our needs to allow for greater efficiencies and to ensure our infrastructure can support our future growth plans. As a capital equipment manufacturer, we will continue to invest in our business to drive future growth. 
 
 Segment Reporting Changes 
 
 We evaluated our organizational structure and concluded that we have two reportable segments; Thermal Processing Solutions (formerly called Semiconductor) and Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions (formerly called Material Substrate). Our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment includes Entrepix beginning at the date of acquisition. 
 
 Industry Fluctuations 
 
 Our quarterly and annual operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by the timing of large system orders. Further, the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical, and the conditions of this industry remain volatile. Therefore, our order flow fluctuates quarter to quarter. For additional information regarding the risks related to our business and industry, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors within this Form 10-K. 
 
 Fiscal Year 
 
 Our fiscal year is from October 1 to September 30. Unless otherwise stated, references to the years 2024, 2023 and 2022 relate to the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 Net Revenue 
 
 Net revenue consists of revenue recognized upon shipment or delivery of equipment. Spare parts sales are recognized upon shipment and service revenue is recognized upon completion of the service activity, which is generally ratable over the term of the service contract. Since the majority of our revenue is generated from large system sales, revenue, gross profit and operating income can be significantly impacted by the timing of system shipments.

Revenue from the Thermal Processing Solutions segment decreased 8.4 million, or 11 , over the prior year period. Our Thermal Processing Solution results for 2024 reflect decreases in belt furnace shipments partially offset by increases in shipments of our horizontal diffusion furnaces. We continue to experience softness in shipments of our advanced packaging and SMT equipment, primarily related to a slowdown in global demand in the consumer markets. Revenue from our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment decreased 3.7 million, or 10 , due to decreases in shipments of our polishing equipment, which was eliminated at the end of 2023, with final shipments in 2024. Additionally, we experienced declines in our wafer cleaning equipment, partially offset by increases in our consumables shipments.

At the end of 2024, two customers individually accounted for 25 and 20 of our total backlog. No other customer accounted for more than 10 of our backlog as of September 30, 2024. The orders included in our backlog are generally credit approved customer purchase orders believed to be firm and are generally expected to ship within the next twelve months. Our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor is backlog any assurance that we will realize profit from completing these orders. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, a horizontal diffusion customer notified us of the cancelation of a furnace project for 4.5 million, which we believe is due to the slow-down in electric vehicle adoption. Also during this period, the improvement in lead times across all of our product lines favorably contributed to the decline in our backlog. 
 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 
 Gross profit is the difference between net revenue and cost of goods sold and intangible asset impairment. Cost of goods sold consists of purchased material, labor and overhead to manufacture equipment and spare parts and the cost of service and support to customers for installation, warranty and paid service calls. Gross margin is gross profit as a percent of net revenue. Our gross profit and gross margin by reportable segment were as follows, dollars in thousands:

Gross profit for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 36.2 million and 35.6 million, respectively, representing an increase of 0.7 million, or 2 . Gross margin for 2024 and 2023 was 36 and 31 , respectively. Gross margin for the Thermal Processing Solutions segment decreased to 35 in 2024, compared to 38 in 2023, due primarily from product mix with decreases in shipments of our high-temperature furnaces, surface-mount technology SMT and packaging equipment, partially offset by increases in shipments of our horizontal diffusion furnaces. Gross margin for the Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment, increased to 37 in 2024, compared to 18 in 2023 due primarily to the 2023 impairment charge of 4.6 million for intangible assets and a charge in the amount of 1.5 million related to the write-off of inventory for our polishing machine products, partially offset by an additional intangible asset impairment charge in 2024 of 0.8 million. We are experiencing moderate material costs increases across all our segments. In response to such increased costs, we continually review our pricing plans and supplier agreements, with the objective of passing these increased costs to our customers where possible; however, we continue to experience pricing pressure from our customers. We are also continuing to explore additional 
 37 

partnerships with contract manufacturers, who can leverage their buying power on a larger scale. Throughout fiscal 2024, we made targeted labor reductions as a result of the shift to contract manufacturing and the continuing slowdown in the broader semiconductor industry. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses consist primarily of the cost of employees, consultants and contractors, facility costs, sales commissions, shipping costs, promotional marketing expenses, legal and accounting expenses and bad debt expense. 
 
 Our net SG A expense by reportable segment was as follows, dollars in thousands:

Total SG A expenses for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 33.8 million and 42.0 million, respectively, representing a decrease of 8.2 million or 19.4 . This decrease was primarily due to staff reductions across all of our locations during 2024, resulting in lower employee expenses and employee-related expenses, such as travel, commissions and bonuses. Non-segment related SG A expense includes 1.5 million and 1.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense for 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Research, Development and Engineering 
 
 Research, development and engineering RD E expenses consist of the cost of employees, consultants and contractors who design, engineer and develop new products and processes as well as materials and supplies used in producing prototypes. RD E expenses may vary from period to period depending on the engineering projects in process. Expenses related to engineers working on strategic projects or sustaining engineering projects are recorded in RD E. However, from time to time, we add functionality to our products or develop new products during engineering and manufacturing to fulfill specifications in a customer s order, in which case the cost of development, along with other costs of the order, are charged to cost of goods sold.

RD E expenses for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.2 million and 7.3 million, respectively, a decrease of 3.1 million. The decrease in RD E expense is due to the timing of purchases related to specific strategic-development projects at our Thermal Processing Solutions and Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segments. Additionally, the prior year period included expenditures related to new product development projects at our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment, which were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Gain on Sale of Fixed Assets 
 
 Gain on sale of fixed assets consists of the gain on the sale of our corporate headquarters in Arizona in March 2024. This sale resulted in a net gain of approximately 2.2 million, after settlement of related sale expenses and disposal of assets. The sale price for our BTU building in Massachusetts was 20.6 million, of which 0.7 million was deducted 
 38 

at closing for commission and other closing expenses. In connection with the sale, we recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of 12.5 million in the year ended 2022. 
 
 Intangible Asset Impairment 
 
 In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recognized impairment of our definite lived intangible assets of 1.3 million at our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment. Of the 1.3 million, 0.8 million of this impairment was recorded in cost of goods sold, and the remainder was recorded within operating expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Additionally, during the year ended September 30, 2023, we recognized impairment of our definite lived intangible assets of 5.2 million at our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment. Of the 5.2 million, 4.6 million of this impairment was recorded in cost of goods sold, and the remainder was recorded within operating expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 9 for a description of the facts and circumstances leading to the intangible asset impairment events. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 
 In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recognized impairment of our goodwill of 6.4 million at our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment as a result of a triggering event identified at the end of the first quarter. 
 
 Severance Expense 
 Severance expense was 0.4 million and 0.7 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Severance expense for the year ended September 30, 2024 relates to staff reductions across all of our divisions. Severance expense for year ended September 30, 2023 relates primarily to the retirement of our founder. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Our effective tax rate was (13.0) and 17.1 in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate is the ratio of total income tax expense to pre-tax income. The effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 . The 2024 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by non-deductible expenses, including goodwill impairment, includible foreign income, foreign withholding tax and losses for which no tax benefit can be recognized. The 2023 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by non-deductible expenses, includible foreign income, foreign withholding tax and losses for which no tax benefit can be recognized. The 2023 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the release of a portion of our valuation allowance in connection with a deferred tax liability related to the Entrepix acquisition. 
 
 In 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax expense and (benefit) of 1.0 million and (2.6) million, respectively. The income tax provisions are based upon estimates of annual income, annual permanent differences, statutory tax rates and credits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense. 
 
 Generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP require that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered, including a company s performance, the market environment in which the company operates and the length of carryback and carryforward periods. According to those principles, it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when the objective negative evidence includes cumulative losses in recent years. Such objective negative evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as future projections. Based on the consideration of all available evidence, we have concluded that we will maintain a full valuation allowance for all net deferred tax assets related to the carryforwards of U.S. net operating losses and tax credits. We will continue to monitor our cumulative income and loss positions in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to determine whether full valuation allowances on U.S. net deferred tax assets are appropriate. 
 
 The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. ASC 740, "Income Taxes", states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be 
 39 

sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. In 2023, we recognized 1.0 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits, and as of September 30, 2024, we have no unrecognized tax benefits recorded within our financial statements. We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. 
 
 We expect to pay minimal U.S federal cash taxes for the foreseeable future as a result of our U.S. net operating losses that are carried forward. 
 
 Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as the amount of income (loss) in each tax jurisdiction, tax regulations governing each region, non-deductible expenses incurred as a percent of pre-tax income and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and define our liquidity risk tolerance based on sources and uses to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to meet our obligations through our industry cycles, under both normal and stressed conditions. We manage our liquidity to provide access to sufficient funding to meet our business needs and financial obligations throughout business cycles. We operate in the semiconductor capital equipment industry, which is cyclical, and we must ensure we have sufficient liquidity during the down cycles and varying macroeconomic conditions. Our liquidity plans are established within the context of our financial and strategic planning processes and consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operating commitments, which include purchase obligations for inventory and equipment, rent, payroll and general expenses. We also take into consideration our capital allocation and growth objectives, including investing in research and development and capital expenditures (including capacity assessments and IT systems). 
 
 The success of our investment and growth strategy is dependent upon the availability of additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to management. Our sources of capital in the past have included a loan and security agreement with UMB Bank, the sale of equity securities, which includes common stock sold in private transactions and public offerings, and cash generated from operations. There can be no assurance that we can raise such additional capital resources when needed or on satisfactory terms. We believe that our principal sources of liquidity discussed above are sufficient to support operations for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 41 

Capital Allocation 
 
 Our capital allocation strategy focuses on building shareholder value. We do this by first investing in ourselves and growing our capabilities. We then look to supplement and strengthen our capabilities through acquisitions and strategic investments. And finally, we provide the return realized by the investments to our stockholders. These three priorities are detailed as follows: 
 
 Invest in R D and capital expenditures to strengthen our competitive position. Historically, our R D efforts have focused on upgrades to existing product platforms as well as new product designs. Capital expenditures consist primarily of capacity expansion as well as investments in IT systems. 

Invest in strategic acquisitions that will complement our strong platform of product offerings. In evaluating these opportunities, our objectives include enhancing our earnings and cash flows, adding complementary product offerings, expanding our geographic footprint, improving our production efficiency and expanding our customer base. As a result, we continue to manage our balance sheet to maintain adequate liquidity so that we may react quickly as opportunities arise. 

Once the above priorities have been met, we evaluate the return of capital to shareholders, as we have done in the past. We have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not expect to pay dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future. However, our Board has from time to time authorized annual stock repurchase plans.

Current ratio (current assets to current liabilities)

2.7:1 

The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from September 30, 2023 of 2.0 million was primarily due to the full repayment of our term loan and revolving credit agreement with UMB Bank, which was funded with cash generated in operations. We maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in Renminbis, a Chinese currency, at our operations in China; therefore, changes in the exchange rates have an impact on our cash balances. 
 
 During periods of weakening demand, we typically generate cash from operating activities, which we may decide to reinvest in our business via strategic projects. Conversely, we are more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which includes common stock sold in private transactions and public offerings, the incurrence of long-term debt and customer deposits. 
 42 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 9.8 million in 2024 compared to cash used in operating activities of 7.7 million in 2023 and cash provided by operating activities of 5.2 million in 2022. During 2024, we decreased our accounts receivable, inventory, and contract asset balances as we completed shipments throughout the year, reducing our backlog. These cash inflows were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as our purchasing activity decreased and the related liabilities were paid. During 2023, we used cash to increase our inventory balances in preparation for shipments scheduled over the next four quarters and to pay the related accounts payable. During 2022, we received several large customer deposits, primarily related to orders of our horizontal diffusion and high temp furnaces, which were expected to ship over the next four quarters. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 2.2 million in 2024, primarily consisting of 4.9 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by 2.7 million of proceeds from the sale of our real property in Arizona. Cash used in investing activities was 37.8 million in 2023, primarily consisting of 34.9 million in cash paid for the acquisition of Entrepix. Cash provided by investing activities was 18.8 million in 2022, primarily consisting of 19.9 million in proceeds from the sale of our real property in Massachusetts. Investing activities in 2024, 2023 and 2022 included capital expenditures of 4.9 million, 2.9 million and 1.1 million, respectively. We expect capital expenditures to decrease slightly in 2025, as we have completed our relocation projects but begain projects to implement new technology across our divisions. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 In 2024, cash used in financing activities was 10.6 million, comprised primarily of 10.7 million payments on long-term debt. Our UMB term loan and revolving credit agreement has been paid in full and our remaining debt is a small amount of financing leases. In 2023, cash provided by financing activities was 11.7 million, comprised of 12.0 million in borrowings on our term loan and 1.2 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options partially offset by 1.5 million in payments on long-term debt. In 2022, cash used in financing activities was 8.3 million, comprised of 4.1 million of cash used for the repurchase of common stock and payments on long-term debt of 4.9 million, partially offset by 0.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Payments in long-term debt in 2022 include the full repayment of the 4.5 million mortgage balance on the real property in Massachusetts. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Acquisitions 
 
 Our business strategy includes the possible acquisition of or investments in other businesses to expand or complement our operations. The magnitude, timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates, the negotiation of acceptable terms, our financial capabilities and access to capital, and general economic and business conditions. Financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash, incurrence of additional debt, issuance of stock or some combination of the foregoing. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. 
 
 On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to income taxes, inventory valuation, business combinations, goodwill and long-lived assets. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, expectations regarding the future and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making conclusions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 A critical accounting estimate is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These uncertainties are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We believe that the following accounting estimates we have identified as critical involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the estimates we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a summary of each of the related accounting policies. 
 
 Income Taxes. We file consolidated federal income tax returns in the United States for all subsidiaries except those in China, Singapore and the UK, where separate returns are filed. The calculation of tax liabilities for all jurisdictions involves significant judgment in identifying uncertain tax positions, estimating the amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized in the future and the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our operations and financial condition. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no unrecognized tax benefit. 
 
 Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. It is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when the negative evidence includes cumulative losses in recent years. If we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized, a tax benefit would be realized when all or part of the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. As of September 30, 2024, we have significant U.S. deferred tax assets that have a full valuation allowance and foreign deferred tax assets that have a partial valuation allowance. Any changes to the judgments related 
 44 

to our valuation allowance could have a material impact on our results of operations. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net deferred tax assets of 0.2 and 0.1 million. 
 
 Inventory Valuation. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory cost includes the purchase price of parts or finished goods and freight and/or other overhead costs incurred to receive the inventory into our manufacturing facilities. We regularly review inventory quantities and record a write-down to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory. The write-down is primarily based on purchase history, historical inventory usage adjusted for expected changes in product demand, product offerings and production requirements. Our industry is characterized by customers in highly-cyclical industries, rapid technological changes, frequent new product developments and rapid product obsolescence. Changes in demand for our products or to our product offerings could result in further write-downs, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2024, we recorded provisions to reduce inventories to their lower of cost and net realizable value of approximately 2.8 million compared to 2.6 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Business Combination. We follow the acquisition method of accounting to record identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquired businesses at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. 
 Identifiable intangible assets from business combinations are recognized at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition and consist of non-compete agreements, backlog, customer relationships, developed technology and trade names. Determination of the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets requires judgment. The fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets were estimated using various valuation methodologies. The multi-period excess earnings method was used to value the acquired developed technology and the distributor method for the acquired customer relationships. Both approaches are income-based methods, which required judgment in estimating appropriate discount rates, obsolescence, customer attrition, and remaining useful lives. Any adverse change in these factors, among others, could have a significant effect on the valuation of the intangible assets and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. The acquired intangible assets all had finite lives, ranging from one to ten years. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of Entrepix was 13.6 million. Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed in an acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired. 
 
 Goodwill . We perform an annual impairment test as of September 30, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. We perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired, and we are not required to perform additional analysis. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value (although the loss would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit). 
 
 Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit s fair value. The income approach is based on a discounted future cash flow analysis that uses certain assumptions including: projections of revenues and expenses and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and demand trends; expected future investments and working capital requirements to sustain and grow the business; and estimated discount rates based on the reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital as derived by the Capital Asset Pricing Model and other methods, which includes observable market inputs and other data from identified comparable companies. The same estimates are also used internally for our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data, and we also perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units. The market approach is based on the application of appropriate market-derived multiples selected from (i) comparable publicly-traded companies and/or (ii) the implied transaction multiples derived from identified merger and acquisition activity in the market. Multiples are then selected based on a comparison of the reviewed data to that of the reporting unit and applied to relevant historical and 
 45 

forecasted financial parameters such as levels of revenues, EBITDA, EBIT or other metrics. If actual results differ significantly from our projections, we may be required to record a material impairment charge. 
 
 At the end of December 2023, we identified a triggering event. As a result of the decline in our stock price as of December 31, 2023, our book value materially exceeded our market value leading to a 6.4 million impairment charge in fiscal 2024. The impairment testing as of September 30, 2024, resulted in the fair value of our Thermal Processing Solutions segment exceeding its carrying value by approximately 44 , and the fair value of our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment exceeding its carrying value by approximately 18 , resulting in no additional goodwill impairment. See Note 10 for additional information on goodwill by segment. 
 
 Long-Lived Asset Impairment. Long-lived assets, including tangible and intangible assets with finite lives, are amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values and are also reviewed for impairment whenever certain triggering events may indicate impairment. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset group to its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group, the Company then compares the carrying value of the individual long-lived assets with their estimated fair values. An impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. If actual results differ significantly from our projections, we may be required to record a material impairment charge. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company performed a qualitative impairment test on intangible assets and goodwill and concluded there was no further impairment. As of December 31, 2023, we identified a triggering event due to the decline in our stock price driving our market value materially below our book value. As a result, we recorded a 1.3 million impairment charge in fiscal 2024 to the intangible assets in our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment. As of September 30, 2023, we identified a triggering event in our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment primarily related to the prolonged downturn and general economic conditions in the semiconductor market, in addition to delays in the adoption of next-gen polishing tools, which reduced our cash flow projections. As a result, we recorded intangible asset impairment of 5.2 million. There were no impairments on long-lived assets during the year ended September 30, 2022. See Note 9 for additional information on intangible assets.

REPORT OF INDEPEND ENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Amtech Systems, Inc.: 
 Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Amtech Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance 
 48 

with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Valuation of Entrepix Inc. developed technology intangible asset 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company regularly reviews intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances exist which indicate the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. When indicators exist, recoverability of assets is measured by comparison of the carrying value of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the asset group is determined not to be recoverable, the Company performs an analysis of the fair value of the individual long-lived assets and will recognize an impairment loss when fair value is less than the carrying value of such long-lived assets. In the first quarter of the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment of the Entrepix Inc. developed technology intangible asset of 0.8 million. 
 We identified the evaluation of the fair value of the Entrepix, Inc. developed technology intangible asset as of the end of the first quarter 2024 as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of subjective auditor judgment in evaluating the key assumptions used in the multi-period excess earnings method to estimate the fair value of the Entrepix, Inc. developed technology asset. Specifically, minor changes to the key assumptions, including projected revenues and expenses, the long-term growth rate, contributory asset charges, and the discount rate, could have a significant effect on the Company s assessment of the intangible asset fair value. Additionally, the use of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assess certain of these key assumptions. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s long-lived asset impairment analysis process. These included controls related to the development of the key assumptions used to estimate fair value of the Entrepix, Inc. developed technology intangible asset. We evaluated the projected revenue and expenses by comparing them with the historical results of the asset group and assessing the impacts of internal and/or external economic factors. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 evaluating the long-term growth rate by comparing it to a long-term growth rate range that was independently developed using publicly available industry and economic growth rates 

evaluating the contributory asset charges by comparing the risk profile of each contributory asset to the risk profile of the developed technology intangible asset and the risk of the overall business (Entrepix, Inc.) 

evaluating the discount rate by comparing it to a discount rate that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable companies. 

49 

Valuation of the Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions reporting unit 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of September 30, or when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company's goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income and market approach to estimate a reporting unit s fair value. The income approach is based on a discounted cash flow analysis and involves the use of assumptions, including projections of revenues and expenses, the long-term growth rate, and the selection of discount rates. In the first quarter of the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill in the Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions reporting unit of 6.4 million. The Company has 21.3 million of goodwill as of September 30, 2024, of which 15.4 million relates to the Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions reporting unit. 
 We identified the evaluation of the fair value of the Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions reporting unit as of the end of the first quarter 2024 and as of September 30, 2024 as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of subjective auditor judgment in evaluating the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions reporting unit. Specifically, minor changes to key assumptions, including projected revenue and expenses, the long-term growth rate, and the discount rate, could have a significant effect on the Company s assessment of the fair value of the reporting unit. Additionally, the use of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assess these key assumptions. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s goodwill impairment process. These included controls related to the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the development of the key assumptions. We evaluated the projected revenue and expenses by comparing them to the historical results of the reporting unit and assessing the impacts of internal and/or external economic factors. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 evaluating the long-term growth rate by comparing it to a long-term growth rate range that was independently developed using publicly available industry and economic growth rates 

evaluating the discount rate by comparing it to a discount rate that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable companies.

 ; for leasehold improvements from three to ; for furniture and fixtures from five to ; for software from three to seven years and for buildings from to . Reviews are regularly performed to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of those assets. 
 or terminate the lease, which we include in the recognition of the ROU asset and lease liability, when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We lease office space, buildings, land, vehicles and equipment. We made an accounting policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components for all existing classes of underlying assets with the exception of land and buildings. Lease agreements with an initial term of 12 months or less with no renewal options are not recorded on the balance sheet. Instead, we recognize the lease expense as incurred over the lease term. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. We have one lease that requires the underlying asset to be returned to its original condition at the end of the lease term. The related asset retirement obligation, which is immaterial, is reflected within other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain lease agreements include one or more options to renew, with individual option terms that can extend the lease term from one to . The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. Some equipment leases also include options to purchase the leased property. The estimated life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. In June 2022, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction to facilitate a future move of our Massachusetts operations, pursuant to which we sold the property to a third party and agreed to lease the property back for two years. To determine whether the transfer of the property should be accounted for as a sale, we evaluated whether we transferred control to the third party in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance set forth in ASC 606. The transfer was 

58

to months. Assurance-type warranties are not considered a performance obligation. We account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers as fulfillment activities instead of assessing such activities as performance obligations. Our obligations for returns and/or refunds are immaterial in all periods presented. 3) Determine the transaction price The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. The transaction price is based on the price reflected in the individual customer s purchase order. Occasionally, our customers earn a commission on the purchase and/or resale of our products. These payments to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue an d are less than of our total revenues. In substantially all of our sales transactions, we incur incremental costs to obtain contracts with customers, in the form of sales commissions. We maintain a commission program which rewards our sales representatives for system sales and our employees for system sales and other individual goals. We have elected a practical expedient to allow for the recognition of commission expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Based on the nature of our contracts with customers, we expense all commissions as incurred based upon the expectation that the amortization period would be one year or less. 4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation. When required, the SSP for each performance obligation is based on observable data from standalone sales. To determine the SSP for labor-related performance obligations, we use directly observable inputs based on the standalone sale prices for these services. 5) Recognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized over time if either (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our performance, (ii) our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or (iii) our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If we do not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring the control of a promised good or service to a customer. For over time recognition, we are required to select a single revenue recognition method for the performance obligation that faithfully depicts our performance in transferring control of the goods and services. Equipment and related product revenues (e.g., furnace systems, system add-ons, machinery, consumables and spare parts) are recognized at a point in time, when they are shipped or delivered, depending on contractual terms. Revenue for services, including maintenance services, is recognized over time based on hours incurred, as the hours incurred align to the maintenance activities performed. We also utilize the as-invoiced practical expedient in certain

from the transaction price all sales taxes that are assessed by a governmental authority and that are imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected from a customer (for example, sales, use, value added, and certain excise taxes). Sales taxes are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2024, have an original duration o f or less. - . We do not have any payment terms that exceed one year from the point we have satisfied the related performance obligations. Management reviews disaggregated revenue at the reportable segment level. Revenue-generating transactions vary between our reportable segments due to several factors. For example, lead times vary among our reportable segments and among our products. Most of the revenue for our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment results from the sale of consumables, rather than equipment sales. These consumables have a much shorter production period than equipment produced by our other reportable segment. Due to these variations between reportable segments, management determined that disaggregated revenue by reportable segment sufficiently depicts how economic factors affect the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows. See Note 16 for additional information on our reportable segments.

While our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and we believe that the amounts accrued for warranty expenditures are sufficient for all systems sold through September 30, 2024, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience a similar level of predictability with regard to warranty costs. In addition, technological changes or previously unknown defects in raw materials or components may result in more extensive and frequent warranty service than anticipated, which could result in an increase in our warranty expense.

million, consisting of million cash consideration to the sellers and million cash paid for debt and Entrepix transaction costs. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Such assets include synergies the Company expects to achieve, such as deeper penetration into an overlapping customer base, complementary product offerings, and cost redundancy reductions. In accordance with the measurement principles in ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement", the purchase consideration for the Acquisition has been allocated under the acquisition method of accounting to the estimated fair market value of the net assets acquired, including a residual amount of goodwill, none of which is deductible for tax purposes. The recorded amounts of acquired accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair value because of the short maturities of these assets and liabilities. The fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment was based on quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets. The fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets were estimated using various valuation methodologies, including the multi-period excess earnings method, the relief from royalty method and the distributor method.

Intangible assets, net 

Intangible assets are amortized over a weighted-average amortization period of years. Our customer relationship and trade name intangible assets are amortized over weighted-average amortization periods of and years, respectively. We review our intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Except as discussed below, we concluded that a triggering event had not occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of intangible assets below their carrying value. We identified a triggering event at the end of September 2023, primarily related to the prolonged downturn and general economic conditions in the semiconductor market, in addition to delays in the adoption of next-gen polishing tools, which reduced our cash flow projections. This triggering event indicated we should test the related long-lived assets for impairment in our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment. We tested each identified asset group within our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment by first performing a recoverability test, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of each asset group to its carrying value. This test indicted that the undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of certain asset groups. We then compared the carrying value of the individual long-lived assets within those asset groups against their fair value in order to determine if impairment existed. Determining the fair value of those asset groups involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projections of revenues and expenses and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and demand trends, and estimated discount rates based on the asset group's weighted average return on assets, as derived from various methods. The fair value of the intangible assets were estimated using various valuation methodologies, including the multi-period excess earnings method, the relief from royalty method and the distributor method. These fair value measurements fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As a result, we recorded a total impairment charge for intangible assets in our Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment of million during 

 70 

million during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. This impairment charge relates to developed technology, trade name, customer relationships and non-competition agreements at Entrepix.

million was recorded as goodwill in the Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions segment. The primary driver for this acquisition was to add CMP and wafer cleaning equipment to our existing substrate polishing and wet process chemical offerings. We review goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We performed our annual test of goodwill impairment as of September 30. The results of the goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair value of both our Thermal Processing and Semiconductor Fabrication Solutions reporting units were in excess of the carrying value, and, thus, were not impaired. At the end of December 2023, we identified a triggering event. As a result of the decline in our stock price as of December 31, 2023, our book value materially exceeded our market value leading to a million impairment charge in fiscal 2024. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit s fair value. The income approach is based on a discounted future cash flow analysis that uses certain assumptions including: projections of revenues and expenses and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and demand trends; expected future investments and working capital requirements to sustain and grow the business; and estimated discount rates based on the reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital as derived by the Capital Asset Pricing Model and other methods, which includes observable market inputs and other data from identified comparable companies. The same estimates are also used internally for our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data, and we also perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units. The market approach is based on the application of appropriate market-derived multiples selected from (i) comparable publicly-traded companies and/or (ii) the implied transaction multiples derived from identified merger and acquisition activity in the market. Multiples are then selected based on a comparison of the reviewed data to that of the reporting unit and applied to relevant historical and forecasted financial parameters such as levels of revenues, EBITDA, EBIT or other metrics. The calculation of fair value falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Additions to valuation allowance 

Balance at the end of the year 

The deferred tax valuation allowance increased by million and million for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the year ended September 30, 2023, we released a portion of our valuation allowance in connection with a deferred tax liability related to the Entrepix acquisition. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. We have established valuation allowances on all net U.S. deferred tax assets, after considering all of the available objective evidence, both positive and negative, historical and prospective, with greater weight given to historical objective evidence, and determined it is not more likely than not that these assets will be realized. We have established a partial valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets that we consider it is more likely than not will not be realized. We intend to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on the undistributed amounts.

Balance at the end of the year 

During fiscal 2023, we reversed our previous accrual of uncertain tax positions in the amount of million. This reversal was reflected in the income tax (benefit) provision line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The reversal resulted from the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Tax Return Matters We file income tax returns in China and other foreign jurisdictions, as well as the U.S. and various states in the U.S. We have not signed any agreements with the Internal Revenue Service, any state or foreign jurisdiction to extend the statute of limitations for any fiscal year. As such, the number of open years is the number of years dictated by statute in each of the respective taxing jurisdictions. U.S. Federal tax returns generally have a statute of limitations. Therefore, U.S. federal returns for tax years ending on or a fter September 30, 2021 remain open for examination. In addition, the IRS may adjust attribute c arryforwards utilized in an open year even though the year the attributes originated may be closed. State and foreign statutes are generally to years but vary by jurisdiction. These open years contain certain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, timing, or inclusion of revenues and expenses, or the sustainability of income tax positions of Amtech and our subsidiaries.

While the amount represents purchase agreements, the actual amounts to be paid may be less in the event that any agreements are renegotiated, canceled or terminated. Legal Proceedings and Other Claims From time to time, we are a party to claims and actions for matters arising out of our business operations. We regularly evaluate the status of the legal proceedings and other claims in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable possibility that a loss, or an additional loss, may have been incurred and determine if accruals are appropriate. If accruals are not appropriate, we further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of possible loss or range of possible loss can be made for disclosure. Although the outcome of claims and litigation is inherently unpredictable, we believe that we have adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses. It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in any particular period by the

 ITEM 9A. CONTROL S AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), has carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures in place were effective as of September 30, 2024 as described further below. 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 To the Shareholders of Amtech Systems, Inc. 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) as issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation we believe that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal controls over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued a Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm related to our internal control over financial reporting, which can be found in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Remediation of Previously Disclosed Material Weaknesses 
 
 As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we identified two material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 In relation to the material weakness identified in the areas of goodwill and intangible assets, we have evaluated the design of internal controls over non-routine and complex transactions, including the preparation and review of the 
 84 

third-party service provider valuation reports. As a result of our evaluation, our management, under the oversight of our Audit Committee, has redesigned existing controls and implemented new controls to remediate the control deficiencies giving rise to the material weakness. 
 
 With respect to the material weakness related to general information technology controls, our management, under the oversight of our Audit Committee, has evaluated the current processes and has redesigned existing controls and implemented new controls to remediate the control deficiencies giving rise to this material weakness. Remediation efforts include, but are not limited to: 
 Assessing and formalizing the design of certain information technology policies. 

Developing monitoring controls and protocols that will allow us to timely assess the design and operating effectiveness of the new controls. 

Strengthening of user access reviews and enhanced procedures surrounding program change management for systems supporting substantially all of the Company s internal control processes. 

Assessing segregation of duties within the Company s business processes. 

Based upon the above, we believe the steps taken have improved the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and we have determined that these new or redesigned controls are operating effectively 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of the Company.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES 
 REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES 
 EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 
 
 Amtech Systems, Inc. Amtech, we, our or us has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended: our common stock. 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 
 
 The following summary of the terms of our capital stock is based upon our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended through February 6, 2012 (the Articles of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended (the Bylaws ). The summary is not complete and is qualified by reference to our Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated by reference herein. We encourage you to read our Articles of Incorporation, our Bylaws and the applicable provisions of the Arizona Revised Statutes for additional information. 
 
 Authorized Shares of Capital Stock 
 
 Our authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.01 par value, and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of November 29, 2024, there were 14,277,066 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. The outstanding shares of our common stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. 
 
 Listing 
 
 Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, under the symbol ASYS. 
 
 Voting Rights 
 
 Each outstanding share of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share of record on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders and to vote together as a single class for the election of directors and in respect of other corporate matters. At a meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present, all questions other than the contested election of directors shall be decided by determining if the votes cast by shareholders favoring the action exceed the votes casts by shareholders opposing the action, without regard to abstentions, unless the matter is one upon which a different vote is required by express provision of Arizona law, the NASDAQ or our articles of incorporation or bylaws. Directors, in a contested election, will be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present at a meeting. Holders of shares of common stock have cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors. 
 
 Dividend Rights 
 
 Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends or other distributions when, as and if declared by our board of directors. The right of our board of directors to declare dividends, however, is subject to any rights of the holders of other classes of our capital stock and the availability of sufficient funds under Arizona law to pay dividends. 
 Preemptive Rights 
 
 The holders of our common stock do not have preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any of our capital stock or other securities. 
 
 Redemption 
 
 The shares of our common stock are not subject to redemption by operation of a sinking fund or otherwise. 

Liquidation Rights 
 
 In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of other classes of our capital stock, the holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive any of our assets available for distribution to our shareholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by them. 
 
 Transfer Agent and Registrar 
 
 The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Investor Services, P.O. Box 43006, Providence, RI 02940-3006. 
 
 Certain Provisions of Arizona Law and The Company s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 
 Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Arizona law could make our acquisition by a third party, a change in our incumbent management or a similar change in control more difficult, including: 
 
 an acquisition of us by means of a tender or exchange offer; 

an acquisition of us by means of a proxy contest or otherwise; or 

the removal of a majority or all of our incumbent officers and directors. 

These provisions, which are summarized below, are likely to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that these provisions help to protect our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us, and that this benefit outweighs the potential disadvantages of discouraging such a proposal because our ability to negotiate with the proponent could result in an improvement of the terms of the proposal. The existence of these provisions which are described below could limit the price that investors might otherwise pay in the future for our securities. This description is intended as a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Arizona law. 
 
 Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Arizona Law 
 Authorized But Unissued Capital Stock . We have shares of common stock and preferred stock available for future issuance without shareholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the listing standards of the NASDAQ. We may utilize these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including for future public offerings to raise additional capital or facilitate corporate acquisitions or for payment as a dividend on our capital stock. The existence of unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock may enable our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management or to issue preferred stock with terms that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, a controlling interest in the Company by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. In addition, if we issue preferred stock, the issuance could adversely affect the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. 
 
 Blank Check Preferred Stock . Our board of directors, without shareholder approval, has the authority under our articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock. As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily, could impair the rights of holders of common stock and could be issued with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control or make removal of management more difficult. 

Number of Directors; Removal; Filling Vacancies . Our articles of incorporation provide that the number of directors shall be fixed by the bylaws which our board of directors can amend without shareholder approval. Our bylaws default to Arizona law with respect to the removal of directors. Arizona law provides that directors may be removed with or without cause where the votes cast by shareholders opposing the action would not be sufficient to elect the director under cumulative voting. A vote to remove one or more directors must be taken at a shareholder s meeting at which a quorum is present where one of the purposes of the meeting is to remove one or more directors. A director cannot be removed by written consent of shareholders unless written consents are obtained from the holders of all the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the removal of the director. Our bylaws provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the remaining directors, though not less than a quorum. Arizona law also provides that shareholders may fill any vacancy on our board of directors. 
 
 Shareholder Meetings and Action . Our bylaws provide that shareholder meetings can only be called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary at the request of a majority of the board of directors. Shareholders are specifically denied the right to call special meetings. Our bylaws also provide that the business of special meetings of shareholders shall be confined to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting. These provisions may discourage another person or entity from making a tender offer, unless it acquired a majority of our outstanding voting stock, because the person or entity could only take action at a duly called shareholders meeting relating to the business specified in the notice of meeting and not by written consent. Arizona law provides that shareholders may act outside of a meeting if one or more written consents describing the action taken are signed by the holders of outstanding shares having one hundred percent (100 of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and voted. 
 
 Anti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions of Arizona Law 
 
 Arizona Revised Statutes ARS Sections 10-2701 et seq. were adopted by the Arizona legislature in an attempt to prevent corporate greenmail and restrict the ability of a potential suitor to acquire domestic corporations. These statutes generally apply to business combinations or control share acquisitions of issuing public corporations, which defined term includes Amtech. The provisions summarized below could discourage, deter, delay or impede a tender offer or other attempt to acquire control of Amtech. 
 
 Arizona Business Combination Statute . The Arizona business combination statute would limit our ability to engage in Business Combinations with Interested Shareholders (each as defined below). 
 
 Business Combination means any (A) merger or consolidation of Amtech or any subsidiary of Amtech with an Interested Shareholder, (B) exchange of shares of the Amtech s common stock or any subsidiary for shares of an Interested Shareholder, or (C) sale, lease, transfer or other disposition to or with an Interested Shareholder of 10 or more of the consolidated assets of Amtech. 
 
 Interested Shareholder means any person other than Amtech or a subsidiary of Amtech that is either (A) a direct or indirect beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of Amtech or (B) an affiliate of Amtech who at any time during the three years immediately before the date in question was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding common stock of Amtech. 
 
 Share Acquisition Date means the date that a person first becomes an Interested Shareholder of Amtech. 
 
 Business Combinations within Three Years After Share Acquisition Date. For three years after an Interested Shareholder s Share Acquisition Date, Amtech may not directly or indirectly engage in any Business Combination with an Interested Shareholder or any affiliate of an Interested Shareholder unless, before the Interested Shareholder s Share Acquisition Date, a committee of disinterested directors approved either: 
 
 the Business Combination; or 

the acquisition of common stock made by the Interested Shareholder on the Interested Shareholder s Share Acquisition Date. 

Business Combinations More Than Three Years After Share Acquisition Date. If a committee of disinterested directors has not approved the Business Combination or the acquisition of common stock as provided above, Amtech may not directly or indirectly engage in any Business Combination with an Interested Shareholder or any affiliate of an Interested Shareholder unless: 
 
 	 the Business Combination is consummated no earlier than three years after the Interested Shareholder s Share Acquisition Date, and before the Share Acquisition Date, Amtech s Board of Directors approved either 
 o	the Business Combination; or 
 o	the acquisition of common stock made by the Interested Shareholder on the Share Acquisition Date; 
 	 the Business Combination is approved no earlier than three years after the Interested Shareholder s Share Acquisition Date by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of the common stock of Amtech (excluding shares of common stock beneficially owned by the Interested Shareholder or any affiliate thereof); or 
 	 the Business Combination is consummated no earlier than three years after the Interested Shareholder s Share Acquisition Date and meets certain specified conditions designed to ensure against discriminatory pricing. 
 
 Arizona Control Share Acquisition Statute . The Arizona control share acquisition statute would limit the voting rights of a person who acquires shares of Amtech under certain circumstances in a control share acquisition (as defined below). 
 
 Control Share Acquisition means an acquisition, directly or indirectly (in one or more transactions within 120 days or pursuant to a plan), by a person of beneficial ownership of shares of common stock of Amtech that would, but for the limitations in the control share acquisition statute, entitle the acquiring person to exercise a new range of voting power within the following specified ranges: (A) at least 20 but less than 33-1/3 , (B) at least 33-1/3 but less than or equal to 50 and (C) over 50 . 
 
 Within ten days after a Control Share Acquisition, the acquiring person must deliver to the corporation an information statement specifying, among other things, the range of voting power in the election of directors that, but for the limitations in the statute, the acquiring person believes would result from the Control Share Acquisition. At the time of delivery of the information statement, the acquiring person may request that a special meeting of shareholders be called to consider the voting rights of excess shares (referred to below). 
 
 To the extent that shares of common stock of Amtech acquired in a Control Share Acquisition exceed the threshold of voting power of any of the next specified range of voting power, such excess shares will have the same voting rights as other shares of common stock for election of directors but will not have the right to vote on other matters unless approved by a shareholder resolution at an annual or special meeting. Such resolution must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of common stock (excluding shares owned by the acquiring person, its affiliates or any officer or director of Amtech). 
 
 The status of voting rights of excess shares is not required to be presented for consideration at any meeting of shareholders unless, at the time of delivery of the information statement referred to above, the acquiring person has entered into a definitive financing agreement for any financing of the acquisition not to be provided by monies of the acquiring person. 
 
 If an acquiring person fails to deliver the required information statement within ten days after a Control Share Acquisition or if the Companies shareholders have voted not to accord voting rights to an acquiring person s excess shares referred to above, then Amtech may call for the redemption of such excess shares at the fair market value of those shares at the time the call for redemption is given. 
 
 Limitation of Liability and Indemnification 
 
 Pursuant to Amtech s articles of incorporation, Amtech shall indemnify any and all of its existing and former directors, officers, employees and agents against all expenses incurred by them and each of them, including, but not limited to legal fees, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement or compromise, which may arise or be incurred, rendered, or levied in any legal action brought or threatened against any of them for or on account of any action or 

omission alleged to have been committed while acting within the scope of employment as director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, whether or not any action is or has been filed against them and whether or not any settlement or compromise is approved by a court, indemnification shall be made by the Company whether the legal action brought or threatened is by or in the right of the Company or by any other person. Whenever any existing or former director, officer, employee, or agent shall report to the President of the Company or the chairman of the board of directors that he or she has incurred or may incur expenses, including, but not limited to, legal fees, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in a legal action brought or threatened against him or her for or on account of any action or omission alleged to have been committed by him or her while acting within the scope of his or her employment as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, the board of directors shall, at its next regular or at a special meeting held within a reasonable time thereafter, determine in good faith, whether in regard to the matter involved in the action or contemplated action, such person acted, failed to act, or refused to act willfully or with gross negligence or with fraudulent or criminal intent. If the board of directors determines, in good faith, that such person did not act, fail to act, or refuse to act willfully or with gross negligence or with fraudulent or criminal intent, in regard to the matter involved in the action or contemplated action, such person acted, failed to act, or refused to act willfully or with gross negligence or with fraudulent criminal intent, indemnification shall be mandatory and shall be automatically extended as specified herein; provided, that the Company shall have the right to refuse indemnification in any instance in which the person to whom indemnification would otherwise have been applicable shall have unreasonably refused to permit the Company, at its own expense and through counsel of its own choosing, to defend him or her in the action. 
 
 Section 10-851 of Arizona s Revised Statutes enables a corporation to eliminate or limit personal liability of members of its board of directors for violations of their fiduciary duty of care. However, Arizona law does not permit the elimination of a director s or officer s liability: (i) in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation in which the director was adjudged liable to the corporation; and (ii) in connection with any other proceeding charging improper financial benefit to the director, whether or not involving action in the director s official capacity, in which the director was adjudged liable on the basis that financial benefit was improperly received by the director. 
 
 Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling Amtech pursuant to the foregoing provision, Amtech has been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
