Our
Future Strategies 

We
intend to pursue the following strategies to further develop and expand our business: 

Continued
 investment in research and development in hybrid air-conditioning products 

The
Group intends to continue development of its hybrid air-conditioning products to further increase its product offerings, as well as
to expand its client base, especially with commercial and industrial clients. The Group plans to expand its distribution into other
South East Asia markets, China and Asia markets, which has high potential demand for air-conditioning as their population gross
domestic product GDP increases. Taking advantage of the global awareness and push to reduce harmful factors leading
to global warming, the Group continues to market its EvoAir TM brand and e-Cond Evo TM as eco-friendly products
aiming to reduce emission of waste heat from the air-conditioner condensing units and at the same time improving energy efficiency.
The Group aims to continue innovation through investment into research and development, to further improve on its product lines,
reduce its carbon emissions as it strives to become a leader in HVAC green inventions. 

Continued
 production of air purifier and air-sanitizing systems 

The
 Group continues to improve on its production of air purifier and air-sanitizing systems in order to capitalize on increased market
 demand for air sanitizing products in the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic. The Group is expanding usage and application of
 its INCU Technology, which acts as an effective disinfectant solution into more sectors and markets as the Group foresees growth
 in demand for air-sanitizing products as a must-have product in general consumer households in the near future. Besides household
 consumers, the Group also aims to expand its commercial and industrial customer base, as well as partake in public sanitation projects.
 In terms of sanitation products, the company aims to expand into personal healthcare products such as formulated toiletries cleansers
 incorporating the INCU ionic nano copper solution as an active ingredient. 

Geographical
 expansion 

A
 key component of our strategy is to enter into and expand into new markets with high demand for HVAC. The Group intends to replicate
 the similar model, continue development of its product line and expand into other Southeast Asian countries and the Chinese market,
 with possible expansion into the Middle East, Indonesia and India in the future. 

Promoting
 importance of environmental-friendly technology 

The
 Group also advocates the importance of promoting environmentally friendly technology and creating awareness to the public to play
 a part in protecting the environment as well as creating synergy with the Group s products and brand image. 
 
 On

 It was a movement launched by EvoAir Group advocating that (i) everyone can enhance his/her lifestyle through green inventions while
 preserving the Earth; and (ii) everyone can be the Ambassador of the Earth - everyone can do a part, be it in the smallest
 way in protecting our environment. Cool the Earth Day is a movement in line with the Company s mission to contribute
 to the Earth and society amidst the alarming global warming and climate change issues confronting the world and its 8 billion population
 through green inventions and creating awareness. We hope that through this movement, people will raise their awareness that everyone

The
Air Conditioner Industry 

Growing
demand for cooling 

According
to International Energy Agency IEA (https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/space-cooling#tracking), there are currently
about 2 billion air conditioning units operating worldwide, and by 2050, it is predicted that there will be 5.6 billion units. According
to the statistics report published by the Japan Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Industry Association JRAIA (https://www.jraia.or.jp)
in July 2022, the world s total air conditioner demand in 2021 is estimated at 110 million, which represent 102 of the world demand
in 2020. Looking at the 2021 world demand in terms of Japan, China and other regions, the largest demand is from China, of which demand
is estimated to have reached 41.305 million, representing 98 of 2020 s demand. China s demand accounts for 38 of the total
global demand. Next to China, the Asian region (excluding Japan and China) stands at approximately 17.983 million, followed by North
America with 16.515 million, Japan with 10.201 million, Europe with 8.885 million and Latin America with 6.547 million. 

Air-conditioners
vary in energy efficiency and their usage lead to a global consumption of approximately 2,000 terawatt hours of electricity annually.
In addition, almost 20 of all the electricity used in buildings is for cooling, accounting for 14 of average peak residential electricity
demand globally. 

The
emerging economies are expected to use more air-conditioners as income levels rise. Of the 2.8 billion people living in the hottest parts
of the world, only 8 currently own air-conditioning units compared to approximately 90 ownership in the United States and Japan. By
2050, India, China and Indonesia may account for 50 of the projected growth in energy use for space cooling.

Global
Emissions from the use of Air Conditioners 

The
efficiency of air conditioners vary widely, in all major markets today, consumers are typically buying air conditioners whose average
efficiencies are less than half of what is available. Carbon dioxide emissions from cooling systems have tripled since 1990 to 1,130
million tons in 2016, and local air pollutants caused by cooling systems have also increased. Greenhouse Gases produced include Carbon
Dioxide and Climate Change: 

Carbon
 dioxide is called a greenhouse gas because it absorbs infrared energy and remits this energy back in all directions. About half of
 that energy goes out into space and about half of it returns to Earth as heat, contributing to the greenhouse effect and climate
 change 

The
 four main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. Carbon dioxide accounts for about 75 
 of global greenhouse gas emissions. 

About
 30 of greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation, 25 come from the production of electricity, 23 comes from industrial
 production, 12 comes from commercial and residential sources and 10 comes from agriculture. 

Climate
 change could increase the occurrence and severity of weather events, such as heat waves, droughts and floods. These changes are likely
 to increase losses to property and crops and affect economic activity. 

The
 usage of air conditioners has a significant impact on the environment. Air-conditioners use chemical refrigerants, usually hydrofluorocarbons
 in their heat exchange systems. The hydrofluorocarbons contributes significantly to global warming if leaked to the atmosphere. 

The
 generation of the electricity to power the air conditioners also contribute to significant emissions, especially when fossil fuels
 are burnt to produce electricity. 

Urbanized
areas have higher temperatures than less urbanized areas, contributing to heat islands. This is because urban areas usually have less
greenery. Roads and buildings absorb and re-emit daytime heat more than forests and water bodies. As a result, urban daytime temperatures
can reach approximately 1 to 7 degrees higher in Fahrenheit than the outlying areas and night-time temperatures can reach approximately
2 to 5 degrees higher in Fahrenheit. The use of air conditioners extract hot air to the outside of buildings. On high temperature days,
the hot air emitted by air-conditioner units increases the outdoor temperature. This in turn increases the need for more cooling and
creates a feedback loop. The use of air conditioners can increase outdoor urban temperatures by more than approximately 1 degree Celsius
in some cities 

Global
Efforts to combat Climate Change and Global Warming 

If
the current rate of growth of energy use by air conditioners continues, the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA predicts that by 2050, global energy usage for space cooling would triple to 6,200 terra watts. This would triple the amount of carbon
dioxide emissions and heavy investments in electricity infrastructure to meet peak electricity demand. This could cause severe financial
strain on emerging economies. 

Over
the years, countries around the world have come together to support policies to combat climate change. However, obtaining consensus has
been challenging because of political and national circumstances. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which entered into force
on 1 January 2019, help protect the climate by phasing down high global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are commonly
used as refrigerants. Promoting the energy efficiency of cooling technology can also significantly increase climate benefits. 

From
 October 31 to November 12, 2021, the 26th annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) was held in Glasgow, Scotland. The objectives
 of COP26 were: 

i.
Countries were called out to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to cap the increase in global temperatures below 1.5 C from
current levels; 

ii.
To protect and restore ecosystems and habitats and build resilient infrastructures to withstand climate change; 

iii.
Developed nations to mobilize 100bn in climate finance per year for poorer nations; and 

iv.
Parties of COP26 to finalize the agreement and rules for action and monitoring. 

The
Role of Air conditioners Efficiency in combating Climate Change 

Intuitively,
the more energy efficient air-conditioners are, the less electricity they would consume, and less fossil fuels would be burnt to produce
electricity. This would lead to less carbon dioxide emissions which could reduce global warming. 

The
EIA highlighted one area where policy action could deliver substantial energy savings quickly by making air conditioners equipment
more efficient. Through stricter minimum energy performance standards and other measure such as labelling, the average energy efficiency
of the stock of air conditioners globally could more than double in efficiency between now and 2050. This could reduce cooling-related
energy demand to 3,400 terawatts in 2050 compared to 6,200 terawatts if efficiency remained at current levels. The 45 reduction in energy
usage or 2,800 terawatts could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1,582 megatons annually. This scenario was called the Efficient Cooling
Scenario by EIA. 

12 | Page 

In
addition, the use of less electricity because of more efficient air conditioners greatly reduces the need to build new generation capacity
to meet peak electricity demand. In the Efficient Cooling Scenario, there would not be a need to build additional capacity deliver the
1,300 gigawatts of power with more efficient air conditioners. This is equivalent to all the coal-fired power generation in China and
India today. In addition, the cumulative infrastructure, fuel and operating costs savings amounted to 2.9 trillion from 2017 to 2050.
This means 45 lower electricity costs for everyone as well, compared to if there were no efficiency improvements in air conditioners

 RISK
 FACTORS 

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

If
we are unable to continue to innovate, meet evolving market trends, adapt to changing customer demands and maintain our culture of innovation,
our ability to sustain and grow our business may suffer. 

The
ongoing success of our business depends on our ability to continue to introduce innovative eco-friendly HVAC products to meet evolving
market trends and satisfy changing customer demands. We must continue to adapt by innovating, improving our products and modifying our
strategies, which could cause us to incur substantial costs. We may not be able to continue to innovate or adapt to changing market and
customer needs in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all. This could adversely impact our ability to expand our ecosystem and
grow our business. Failure to develop new products to meet evolving market demands through innovation could cause us to lose current
and potential customers and harm our operating results and financial condition. 

In
addition, we may not be able to maintain our culture of innovation, which has been critical to our success and has helped us create value
for our shareholders, succeed as a leader in eco-friendly HVAC products, attract, retain and motivate employees and other ecosystem participants.
Among other challenges, we may not be able to identify and promote people into leadership positions who share our culture and also focus
on technology and innovation. Competitive pressure may also cause us to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision
and values. If we cannot maintain our culture of innovation, our long-term business prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 

We
operate in a competitive industry, and if we fail to compete effectively, our business could suffer. 

The
air-conditioning and air purifying industry in Asia is highly competitive. Competition in our HVAC products includes several multinational,
regional and local companies, the largest players of which include Daikin Industries, Gree Electric, Trane Technologies, Johnson
Controls, Lennox International, Midea Group and Mitsubishi Electric. Sales depend on price, product availability, delivery schedule,
product performance, product line breadth, brand reputation, design, technical expertise and service. In addition to established players,
we face competition from new market entrants. Increased competition may lead to a loss of market share, increased difficulty in launching
new service offerings, reduction in revenue or increase in loss, any one of which could harm our business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

In
certain of our businesses, our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other factors,
the cost to timely provide the products and services. To generate an acceptable return, we must accurately estimate our costs and schedule.
If we fail to do so, the profitability of contracts may be materially and adversely affected including because some of our contracts
provide for liquidated damages if we do not perform on time which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position,
results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

18 | Page 

If
we are unable to create brand influence, we may not be able to maintain current or attract new users and customers for our products. 

Our
operational and financial performance is highly dependent on the strength of our brand. We believe brand familiarity and preference will
continue to have a significant role in winning over customers. In order to further expand our customer base, we may need to substantially
increase our marketing expenditures to enhance brand awareness through various online and offline means. Moreover, negative coverage
in the media of our company could threaten the perception of our brand, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to defuse negative
press coverage about our company to the satisfaction of our investors, customers and suppliers. If we are unable to defuse negative press
coverage about our company, our brand may suffer in the marketplace, our operational and financial performance may be negatively impacted. 

Currently,
we sell our products, under our various product line brands, to domestic customers in Malaysia and to overseas customers. However, while
the management does not consider the likelihood to be high, if our competitors initiate a lawsuit against us for infringing their trademarks,
we may be forced to adopt a new brand name for our products. As a result, we may incur additional marketing costs to raise awareness of
such new brand name. We may also be ordered to pay a significant amount of damages, and our business, results of operations and financial
condition could be materially and adversely affected. We operate in a competitive environment and our profitability and competitive position
depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs and timing of providing our products and services. 

Climate
change and regulations associated with climate change could adversely affect our business. 

The
effects of climate change, including extreme weather conditions, create financial risks to our business. The effects of climate
change could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials and by increasing insurance and other
operating costs. The effects of climate change also may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing
facilities in the areas most prone to physical risks, which could similarly increase our operating and material costs. We could also
face indirect financial risks pass ing through the
supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them. 

There
is a general consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change, and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically
to avert its worst effects. As a result, increased public awareness and concern about climate change will likely continue to (1) generate
more international, regional and/or national concerns and result in the implementation of further requirements and restrictions at international,
regional and/or national level to curtail the use of high global warming potential refrigerants (which are essential to many of our products);
(2) encourage increase in building energy efficiency; and (3) cause a shift away from the use of fossil fuels as an energy source. While
our products are focused on being eco-friendly, these requirements may render some of the existing technology, particularly some of our
products that require refrigerant use, non-compliant or obsolete. While we continue to be committed to developing eco-friendly sustainable
solutions for our products, there can be no assurance that our development efforts will be successful, that our products will be accepted
by the market, that proposed regulations or deregulation will not have an adverse effect on our competitive position, or that economic
returns will reflect our investments in new product development. 

The
inconsistent international, regional and/or national requirements associated with climate change regulations also create economic and
regulatory uncertainty. There is also regulatory and budgetary uncertainty associated with government incentives, which, if discontinued,
could adversely impact the demand for energy-efficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance. 

Our
business and financial performance depend on continued and substantial investments in our information technology infrastructure, which
may not yield anticipated benefits and which may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. 

The
efficient operation of our business requires continued and substantial investments in information technology IT infrastructure
systems. The failure to design, develop and implement new IT technology infrastructure systems in an effective and timely manner or to
maintain existing systems could divert management s attention and resources. Our information systems may also become obsolete because
of inadequate investments, requiring an unplanned transition to a new platform that could be time consuming, costly, and damaging to
our competitive position and could require additional management attention. Repeated or prolonged interruptions of service because of
poor execution, inadequate investments or obsolescence could have a significant adverse impact on our reputation and our ability to sell
products and services. 

19 | Page 

In
addition, our business may be impacted by disruptions to our or third-party IT infrastructure, which could result from (among other causes)
cyber-attacks, infrastructure failures or compromises to our physical security. Cyber-based risks are evolving and include attacks: (i)
on our IT infrastructure (ii) targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of hardware and software; (iii) on information installed,
stored or transmitted in our products (including after the purchase of those products and when they are installed into third-party products);
and (iv) on facilities or similar infrastructure. Such attacks could disrupt our systems (or those of third parties) and business operations,
impact the ability of our products to work as intended or result in the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction
of information in violation of applicable law and/or contractual obligations. We have experienced cyber-based attacks and, due to the
evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency or severity. We continue to
make investments and adopt measures to enhance our protection, detection, response and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential
risks to our technology, products, services, operations and confidential data. However, depending on the nature, sophistication and scope
of cyber-attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period. As a result, we could potentially
experience: (i) production downtimes; (ii) operational delays or other detrimental impacts on our operations; (iii) destruction or corruption
of data; (iv) security breaches; (v) manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products; and (vi) financial
losses from remedial actions, loss of business, liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation any of which could
have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Due to the evolving
nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. In addition, because of the global nature of our business,
our internal systems and products must comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards in a number of jurisdictions, and government
enforcement actions and violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws could be costly or interrupt our business operations. Any disruption
to our business arising from such issues, or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated,
could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

We
depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers.
Infringement of or the failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. 

The
Company s intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents, trademarks, proprietary technology,
technical data, business processes and other confidential information. Although we consider our intellectual property rights in the aggregate
to be valuable, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them.
We nonetheless rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, nondisclosure agreements, customer and supplier agreements, license agreements,
information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property.
We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and
supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. Our efforts to protect such
intellectual property and proprietary information may not be sufficient, however. 

We
cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us
in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will found to be valid or sufficiently
broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. 

In
addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or
seeking to prevent the sale and marketing of certain of our products. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations
on our ability to obtain possession, ownership or necessary licenses concerning data important to the development or sale of our products
or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. Any
of these events or factors could subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt
our sales and marketing of the affected products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results
of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

20 | Page 

We
use a variety of raw materials and supplier-provided parts in our business. Significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints or production
disruptions, price increases, or tariffs could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. 

Our
reliance on suppliers and commodity markets to secure components and raw materials (such as copper and steel as well as INCU ionic copper
solution), and on service providers to deliver our products, exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials
and services. That potential volatility is particularly acute in certain instances where we depend upon a single source. Issues with
suppliers (such as delivery or production disruptions, capacity constraints, quality issues, consolidations, closings or bankruptcies),
price increases, raw material shortages, or the decreased availability of trucks and other delivery services could have a material adverse
effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. 

We
use various strategies to lock in prices of expected purchases of certain raw materials; however, these efforts could cause us to pay
higher prices for a commodity when compared with the market price at the time the commodity is actually purchased or delivered. Tariffs
can also increase our costs, the impact of which is difficult to predict. However, we believe that our supply management and production
practices appropriately balance the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, these risks may have a material
adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

We
design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies. The introduction of new products and technologies involves
risks, and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. 

Our
future success depends on designing, developing, producing, selling and supporting innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies.
The regulations applicable to our products, as well as our customers product and service needs, change from time to time. Moreover,
regulatory changes may render our products and technologies non-compliant. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological
advancements or product improvements including those associated with regulatory changes depends on a variety of factors,
including: meeting development, production, and regulatory approval schedules; meeting performance plans and expectations; the availability
of raw materials and parts; our suppliers performance; the hiring, training and deployment of qualified personnel; achieving efficiencies;
identifying emerging regulatory and technological trends; validating innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies
and products; and the costs and customer acceptance of our new or improved products. 

Failure
to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact
our results. 

Product
and service quality issues could harm customer confidence in our company and our brands. If certain of our product offerings do not meet
applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety or quality, we can experience lost sales and increased
costs and we can and have been exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks. Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns
could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions, which has also occurred in certain instances. In addition, when
our products fail to perform as expected, we are exposed to warranty, product liability claims, personal injury and other claims. 

We
maintain strict quality controls and procedures. However, we cannot be certain that these controls and procedures will reveal defects
in our products or their raw materials, which may not become apparent until after the products have been placed in use in the market.
Accordingly, there is a risk that products will have defects, which could require a product recall. Product recalls can be expensive
to implement, and may damage our reputation, customer relationships and market share. 

In
many jurisdictions, product liability claims are not limited to any specified amount of recovery. If any such claims or contribution
requests or requirements exceed our available insurance or if there is a product recall, there could be an adverse impact on our results
of operations. In addition, a recall or claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues
are present in other products, which could result in a significant disruption to our business and which could have a further adverse
impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will not experience
any material warranty or product liability claim losses in the future, that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims
or that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recalls, repair and replacement costs.

We
are subject to litigation, environmental, and other legal and compliance risks. 

We
are subject to a variety of litigation, legal and compliance risks. These risks relate to, among other things, personal injuries, intellectual
property rights, contract-related claims, taxes, environmental matters, employee health and safety, competition laws and laws governing
improper business practices. If found responsible in connection with such matters, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties,
repayments and other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), and experience reputational harm. 

On
October 8, 2021, a filing (the Filing was made with the Kuala Lumpur High Court by a reseller (the Reseller of the Company s INCU ionic nano copper solution (the Solution and the Reseller s related party (together
with the Reseller, the Plaintiffs ). The Reseller was authorized by WKL Eco Earth as its sole distributor of the Solution
(the WKL Distributor to resell the Solution together with a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml through a
tripartite agreement (the Tripartite Agreement entered into between (a) the Reseller, (b) the WKL Distributor and (c)
a solution packaging company (the Packaging Company ). WKL Eco Earth was not a party to the Tripartite Agreement and did
not directly authorize or engage the Reseller in the resale of the Solution. In the Filing, the Plaintiffs claimed against (i) WKL Eco
Earth; (ii) Dr. Low; (iii) Chan Kok Wei, (iv) the Packaging Company and (v) two directors of the Packaging Company for loss and damages
arising from an alleged breach of contract, defamation and tort of inducement. The Plaintiffs also alleged that pursuant to the Tripartite
Agreement, WKL Eco Earth was prohibited from selling the Solution to any party other than the WKL Distributor, and that the Tripartite
Agreement allowed for the resale of the Solution by the Plaintiffs without limitation, the Plaintiffs were not confined in their resale
of the Solution to a product consisting of a diffuser with a capacity of not more than 1000ml. The Company believes the claims are without
merit and will defend itself against the claims. 

On April 9, 2024, a notice of withdrawal was filed with the Kuala Lumpur
High Court, whereby it was agreed upon both the Reseller and the Company that the Reseller withdraws their claims in the Filing without
liberty to file afresh and with no order as to costs, and that the Company withdraws its counterclaim against the Reseller without liberty
to file afresh and with no order as to costs. 

As
a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in Malaysia. and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and
regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance.
Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we operate,
structure our investments and enforce our rights. 

Changes
in environmental and climate change related-laws could require additional investments in product designs, which may be more expensive
or difficult to manufacture, qualify and sell and/or may involve additional product safety risks and could increase environmental compliance
expenditures. 

At
times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over the allocation of cleanup
costs, alleged personal injuries and property damage. Existing and future asbestos-related claims could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flow. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging
that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions.
Property damage lawsuits may involve claims relating to environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. Even in litigation
where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision could have a material adverse effect on
our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims
in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations or where certain of our products have been manufactured and used. 

Our
failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, or effectively manage our employees, customers and business partners, could
severely damage our reputation, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

We
are subject to risks in relation to actions taken by us, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers that constitute
violations of the anti-corruption laws and regulations. While we adopt strict internal procedures and work closely with relevant government
agencies to ensure compliance of our business operations with relevant laws and regulations, our efforts may not be sufficient to ensure
that we comply with relevant laws and regulations at all times. If we, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers
violate these laws, rules or regulations, we could be subject to fines and/or other penalties. Actions by Malaysia regulatory authorities
or the courts to provide an alternative interpretation of the laws and regulations or to adopt additional anti-bribery or anti-corruption
related regulations could also require us to make changes to our operations. Our reputation, corporate image, and business operations
may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with these measures or become the target of any negative publicity as a
result of actions taken by us, our employees, third-party customers or third-party suppliers. 

Our
business depends on the continued contributions made by Low Wai Koon Dr. Low ), as our founder, chief executive officer,
chief operating officer and chairman of the board, the loss of who may result in a severe impediment to our business, results of operation
and financial condition. 

Our
success is dependent upon the continued contributions made by founder, chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chairman
of the board, Dr. Low. We rely on his expertise in business operations when we are developing our business. We have no Key Man 
insurance to cover the resulting losses in the event that Dr. Low should die or resign. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group has
continued to invest in its personnel training as well as investment into its research and development department. 

However,
if Dr. Low cannot serve the Company or is no longer willing to do so, the Company may not be able to find alternatives in a timely manner
or at all. This would likely result in severe damage to our business operations and would have an adverse material impact on our financial
position and operating results. To sustain our operations, the Company may have to recruit and train replacement personnel at a higher
cost. In addition, if Dr. Low joins our competitors or develops similar businesses that are in competition with our Company, our business,
results of operation and financial conditions may also be negatively impacted.

Risks
Related to Doing Business in Malaysia 

Developments
in the social, political, regulatory and economic environment in Malaysia may have a material adverse impact on us. 

Our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by social, political, regulatory and economic
developments in Malaysia. Such political and economic uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks of war, terrorism, nationalism,
nullification of contract, changes in interest rates, imposition of capital controls and methods of taxation. 

According
to Economy Outlook 2024 from Ministry of Finance Malaysia, global growth is projected to moderate in 2023 and 2024 following slow growth
in advanced economies; volatile financial market due to tightening monetary policy; prolonged geopolitical tensions; and increasing climatic
changes. Nevertheless, inflation continues to soften as markets head towards supply chain stabilisation. In addition, world trade is
projected to moderate in 2023 in line with weaker global demand. However, global trade is expected to increase in 2024 in tandem with
improved trade activity in advanced economies, and emerging market and developing economies EMDEs ). In the case of Malaysia,
the economy continued to expand amid these persistent challenges in the external environment. During the first half of 2023, GDP posted
a growth of 4.2 supported by resilient domestic demand, in particular private expenditure. 

Recent updates confirm Malaysia s resilience, with the World Bank revising
its 2024 GDP growth forecast to 4.9 , up from 4.3 . This growth is driven by strong domestic demand, trade recovery, and policy initiatives
like the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) and New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030). Malaysia s GDP growth reached
5.1 in the first half of 2024, a marked improvement from 4.1 in first half of 2023. This growth has put Malaysia on track to achieve
a full-year growth rate in the range of 4.8 to 5.3 , surpassing earlier projections of 4 to 5 . The economy exceeded expectations with
first-half growth of 5.1 in 2024, reflecting robust private spending and export recovery.

On
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization or WHO declared the corona virus or COVID-19 a pandemic. To help counter the transmission
of COVID-19, from March 18, 2020 to April 26, 2022, the government of Malaysia initiated Movement Control Orders MCO ).
The MCO had resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and facilities in Malaysia. Conditional
Movement Control Orders were introduced where most business sectors were allowed to operate under strict rules and Standard Operating
Procedures mandated by the government of Malaysia, followed by Recovery Movement Control Orders. At the height of the pandemic, on January
12, 2021, the Malaysian government even declared a state of emergency nationwide to combat COVID-19. On April 1, 2022, the Malaysian
government announced the country had begun transitioning into the endemic phase with further easing of restrictions. We are witnessing
the adverse impact on the purchasing power of consumers in Malaysia, where our products are mainly sold as a direct result of the prolonged
pandemic. As such, the extent to which the coronavirus may continue to adversely impact the Malaysian economy is uncertain. In the event
that the Malaysia economy suffers, demand for our products may diminish, which would in turn result in our profitability. This could
in turn result in a substantial need for restructuring of our business objectives and could result in a partial or entire loss of an
investment in our Company. 

We
are subject to foreign exchange control policies in Malaysia. 

The
ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us may be restricted by the foreign exchange control policies
in the countries where we operate. For example, there are foreign exchange policies in Malaysia which support the monitoring of capital
flows into and out of the country in order to preserve its financial and economic stability. The foreign exchange policies are administered
by the Foreign Exchange Administration, an arm of Bank Negara Malaysia BNM ), the central bank of Malaysia. The foreign
exchange policies monitor and regulate both residents and non-residents. Under the current Foreign Exchange Administration rules issued
by BNM, non-residents are free to repatriate any amount of funds from Malaysia in foreign currency other than the currency of Israel
at any time (subject to limited exceptions), including capital, divestment proceeds, profits, dividends, rental, fees and interest arising
from investment in Malaysia, subject to any withholding tax. In the event BNM or any other country where we operate introduces any restrictions
in the future, we may be affected in our ability to repatriate dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries in Malaysia or in such
other countries. Since we are a holding company and rely principally on dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries for our cash
requirements, any restrictions on such dividends or other payments could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition
and results of operation.

Many
of the economies in Asia, including Singapore, are experiencing substantial inflationary pressures which may prompt the governments to
take action to control the growth of the economy and inflation that could lead to a significant decrease in our profitability in the
future. 

While
many of the economies in Asia have experienced rapid growth over the last two decades, they currently are experiencing inflationary pressures.
As governments take steps to address the current inflationary pressures, there may be significant changes in the availability of bank
credit, interest rate increases, limitations on loans, or restrictions on currency conversions and foreign investment. There also may
be imposition of price controls. If prices for the products we source or if wages rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for
the rise in these costs, it may have an adverse effect on our profitability. If these or other similar restrictions are imposed by a
government to influence the economy, it may lead to a slowing of economic growth. Singapore s core inflation declined to 2.1 on a
year-on-year (y-o-y) basis in October 2024, compared to 2.8 in September 2024. This was due to a moderation in services, electricity gas, and retail
 other goods inflation. CPI (consumer price index) All Items inflation eased to 1.4 
year-over-year in October 2024, from 2.0 in September 2024. 

(source:

While
this inflationary trend will result in higher operational costs, we believe that this also strengthens our value proposition by emphasizing
potential savings to customers through improved productivity and workflow efficiency derived from our technology solutions. To mitigate
inflationary pressures, we will regularly review our pricing structure to ensure sustainable profitability. 

Risks
Related to Intellectual Property 

If
we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property and information, and protect against third party claims that
we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 

The
value of our business depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property including our patents applications and trademarks,
as well as our customer, employee, and customer data. Third parties may try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in
Asia and around the world. In addition, intellectual property rights and protections in Malaysia may be insufficient to protect material
intellectual property rights. Further, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing
on our intellectual property rights. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property. We may need
to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.
If we fail to protect our proprietary intellectual property and information, including with respect to any successful challenge to our
ownership of intellectual property or material infringements of our intellectual property, this failure could have a significant adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

If
we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are accused of infringing on the intellectual property
rights of others, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend
our rights. 

Our
commercial success will depend in part on our success in obtaining and maintaining patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and
other intellectual property rights in Malaysia and elsewhere and protecting our proprietary technology. If we do not adequately protect
our intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies or the goodwill we have acquired
in the marketplace and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. 

We
cannot provide any assurances that any of our pending patent applications that mature into issued patents will include a scope sufficient
to protect our products, any additional features we develop for our products or any new products. Other parties may have developed technologies
that may be related or competitive to our system, may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive
patents that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or devices or by claiming subject
matter that could dominate our patent position. Our patent position may involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore,
the scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued,
may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. Proceedings challenging our patents could result in either loss
of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent
application. In addition, such proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that we may own may not provide any protection against competitors.
Furthermore, an adverse decision in an interference proceeding can result in a third party receiving the patent right sought by us, which
in turn could affect our ability to commercialize our products. 

24 | Page 

Though
an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable, its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may
not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Competitors
could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts,
willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our patents, or develop and obtain patent protection for more effective
technologies, designs or methods. 

We
may be unable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, suppliers, vendors,
former employees and current employees. 

Our
ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It may be difficult to detect infringers who do not
advertise the components that are used in their products. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement
in a competitor s or potential competitor s product. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages
or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful. 

In
addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted
narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against us, including that some or all of the claims in
one or more of our patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If any of our patents covering our products are invalidated or found
unenforceable, or if a court found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered one or more of our products, our competitive
position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights. 

The
degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that: 

any of our pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope sufficient to protect our products; 

any of our pending patent applications will be issued as patents; 

we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions; 

others will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe our patents; any of our patents will be found to ultimately
be valid and enforceable; 

any patents issued to us will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products, will provide us with any
competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties; 

we will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable; or 

our commercial activities or products will not infringe upon the patents of others. 

We
rely, in part, upon unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Further,
our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors.

Risks
Relating to Our Securities 

There
may not be sufficient liquidity in the market for our securities in order for investors to sell their securities. 

There
is currently only a limited public market for our ordinary share, which is listed on the Over-the-Counter Pink Sheets, and there can
be no assurance that a trading market will develop further or be maintained in the future. 

Volatility
in our shares price may subject us to securities litigation. 

The
market for our shares may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price may
continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities
class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future,
be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management s
attention and resources. 

Our
ordinary share may be considered a penny stock and may be difficult to sell. 

The
SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less
than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our ordinary
share is less than 5.00 per share and, therefore, it may be designated as a penny stock according to SEC rules. This designation
requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement
from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability
of brokers or dealers to sell our ordinary share and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares. 

The
market for penny stocks has experienced numerous frauds and abuses, which could adversely impact investors in our stock. 

OTC
Pink Sheet securities are frequent targets of fraud or market manipulation, both because of their generally low prices and because OTC
Pink Sheet reporting requirements are less stringent than those of the stock exchanges or NASDAQ. 

Patterns
of fraud and abuse include: 

Control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; 

Manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; 

Boiler room practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; 

Excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and mark-ups by selling broker-dealers; and 

Wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along
with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses. 

Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market . 

We
have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and any return on investment may be
limited to the value of our stock. 

We
have never paid any cash dividends on our ordinary share and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ordinary share in the
foreseeable future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock. We plan to retain any future earnings to finance
growth. 

We
are a smaller reporting company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller
reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are currently a smaller reporting company , meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset- backed issuer, or a
majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and annual revenues of less than 50.0 million
during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a smaller reporting company, 
at such time as we cease being an emerging growth company, we will be required to provide additional disclosure in our
SEC filings. However, similar to an emerging growth companies , smaller reporting companies are able to provide
simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things,
only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings
due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations
and financial prospects.

General
Risks 

Natural
disasters, epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition
and may not be fully covered by insurance. 

The
occurrence of one or more natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events, including hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, tsunamis, floods and other forms of severe weather, health epidemics, pandemics (including COVID-19) or other contagious outbreaks,
conflicts, wars or terrorist acts, in the U.S. or in other countries in which we or our suppliers or customers operate could adversely
affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events could damage or close one
or more of our facilities or disrupt our operations temporarily or long-term, such as by causing business interruptions or by affecting
the availability and/or cost of materials needed for manufacturing. We have only one factory and another assembly line that can manufacture
a specific product or product line. As a result, damage to or the closure of that factory may disrupt or prevent us from manufacturing
certain products. Existing insurance arrangements may not cover all of the costs or lost cash flows that may arise from such events.
The occurrence of any of these events could also increase our insurance and other operating costs or harm our sales. 

We
may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions, and conditions in the construction, transportation and infrastructure
industries in particular. 

Our
business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and
geopolitical risks and conditions, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, fluctuations in residential,
commercial and industrial construction activity, pandemic health issues (including COVID-19 and its effects), natural disasters, commodity
prices, energy costs, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies (including tariffs,
boycotts and sanctions), regulatory changes, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the
global economy. 

These
economic and political conditions affect our business in a number of ways. Additionally, the tightening of credit in the capital markets
could adversely affect the ability of our customers, including individual end-customers and businesses, to obtain financing for significant
purchases and operations, which could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services. Similarly, tightening
credit may adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress
or bankruptcy. Additionally, because we have a number of factories and suppliers in foreign countries, the imposition of tariffs or sanctions
or unusually restrictive border crossing rules could adversely affect our supply chain, operations and overall business. 

Our
business and financial performance is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases
in business and consumer spending and construction (both residential and commercial as well as remodelling). 

Our
business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. 

Our
ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce.
Failure to ensure that we have leadership with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth
objectives, execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership.

 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in
this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual
results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such
differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited consolidated financial
statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP ). 

Plan
of Operation and Funding 

We
expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through internally generated funds and proceeds from issuances of
securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing
working capital, proceeds from issuance of securities, further advances, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to
fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have
financed operations to date through internally generated funds, advances and proceeds from issuance of securities. In connection
with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i)
research and development; (ii) expansion of product offerings; (iii) geographical expansion; and (iv) marketing expenses. We intend
to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities and advances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and
generate revenue to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity will result in dilution to our current
shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional
financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on
acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could
significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

Results
of Operations 

The
following table sets forth certain selected statement of operations data for the financial year indicated in U.S. Dollars. In addition,
we note that the year-to-year comparison may not be indicative of future performance. 

The
following summary of our operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the financial years ended
August 31 FYE ), 2024, and 2023, which are included herein.

Revenue 

The Group recorded a revenue of 314,719 for FYE 2024,
representing a decrease of approximately 73,319, or 19 , compared to FYE 2023 revenue of 388,038. This decline was primarily driven
by a reduction in sales of our eco-friendly air-conditioning units, particularly our flagship product, EvoAir , which is a pioneering
hybrid air-conditioner designed with a proprietary HECS system. 

As the first mover in the eco-friendly air-conditioning
market, the Group encountered both significant opportunities and challenges during the year. The EvoAir air-conditioner, which
is either granted a patent or utility model pending, presented unique challenges related to its certifications and testings. Specifically,
while working with relevant authorities and organizations to apply for the necessary safety and performance certifications and approvals,
the Group encountered difficulties in having our product appropriately categorized within the existing frameworks for conventional air
conditioners. In certain cases, the authorities lacked the equipment or resources to conduct the required tests. 

Despite these challenges, the Group actively engaged
in educating and collaborating with these organizations to resolve compliance and testing issues. A positive outcome of this effort was
the recommendation from one of the authorities to apply under a newly established category: Hybrid Air Conditioners. However,
this process, due to its novelty, was more time-consuming than the typical certification processes for traditional air-conditioning systems. 

In addition to certification challenges, the adoption
of EvoAir by corporate clients also experienced delays. While the Group received significant interest from several corporate clients
who were impressed with the product s potential for energy savings and performance, many of them undertook additional studies to evaluate
the long-term benefits of EvoAir . This independent research and assessment by potential customers resulted in extended decision-making
timelines. 

Despite these hurdles, the Group remains optimistic
about the long-term potential of EvoAir . We are steadily building momentum and expanding the product s reach across various
markets, including residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. This is being achieved through the development of strategic distribution
channels, project collaborations, and private labelling and licensing models. The Group remains committed to strengthening the traction
of EvoAir and driving its adoption across diverse market segments, positioning ourselves for future growth in the emerging eco-friendly
air-conditioning space. 

We remain
confident in the long-term prospects of EvoAir and are focused on continuing to innovate and address challenges, with a view to
establishing the product as a leading solution in the sustainable cooling market.

Cost of revenue 

The Company recorded a cost of revenue of 323,038
for FYE 2024, which represents 103 of total revenue, compared to 424,189, or 109 of revenue, in FYE 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue
is consistent with the decline in sales of our eco-friendly air conditioning products and reflects improvements in our overall cost structure. 

The cost of revenue encompasses production costs and
the purchase of goods. The reduction in cost of revenue as a percentage of sales reflects both the lower volume of sales and the Company s
ongoing efforts to optimize production efficiencies and manage costs. These efforts include streamlining procurement processes and enhancing
cost management, which have contributed to the improvement in our overall cost of revenue despite the sales decline. 

Looking ahead, the Company remains focused on further
optimizing its cost structure and maintaining efficiencies as it continues to scale its operations and expand its product offerings. 

Gross (loss) 

The Company reported a gross loss of 8,319 for FYE
2024, representing 3 of revenue. This reflects a significant improvement compared to the gross loss of 36,151 in the FYE 2023, which
constituted 9 of revenue. 

The improvement in gross loss margin from FYE 2023
to FYE 2024 was primarily driven by a strategic reduction in the overall cost of revenue. These efforts included more efficient cost management,
supplier renegotiations, and optimized production processes. This progress underscores the Company s commitment to enhancing operational
efficiency and moving toward sustained profitability. 

Management will continue to focus on cost control
measures and revenue growth initiatives to build on this positive momentum in the upcoming financial periods. 

Operating expenses 

Operating expenses for FYE 2024 amounted to 26,311,487,
reflecting a 332 increase compared to 6,097,019 recorded in FYE 2023. This increase of 20,214,468 was primarily attributable to an
increase in technology-related intangible asset impairment and net off with the decrease in general administrative expenses since the
IPO related offering cost has been capitalized. 

Key components of operating expenses included salaries
and related expenses, commissions, rental costs, patent and trademark application/renewal fees, professional and compliance fees. 

The Company remains focused on prudent cost management
to maintain operational efficiency while supporting strategic initiatives for growth and value creation. 

Other income/ (expenses) 

Other income for FYE 2024 was not material. By comparison,
in FYE 2023, other income primarily comprised realized foreign exchange losses. 

The minimal impact of other income in FYE 2024 reflects
a limited exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Management remains committed to monitoring external factors that may affect foreign
exchange losses and will take proactive measures to mitigate any potential risks in the future. 

Net loss 

The Company reported a loss from operations before
income taxes of 26,315,369 for FYE 2024, compared to 6,317,373 for FYE 2023. 

Apart from the technology-related intangible asset
impairment, the continued net loss is primarily attributable to the Company s strategic investments in building the necessary infrastructure
and resources to support its business expansion objectives. Additionally, the lack of economies of scale during this growth phase has
impacted the bottom line. 

Management remains confident that these investments
will position the Company for long-term growth and profitability as it scales operations and capitalizes on emerging opportunities. Strategies
to enhance operational efficiencies and achieve economies of scale are key priorities moving forward.

As of August 31, 2024, our company s current liabilities stood at
 1,684,638, which included accounts payable and accruals of 267,900, other payables of 95,831, deferred revenue 10,012, current portion
hire purchase creditor 8,758 , amount due to shareholders 1,202,692, and current portion
operating lease liabilities of 99.445 . The increase in current liabilities was mainly
attributable to amount due to shareholders. 

29 | Page 

As of August 31, 2024, the Company had a deficit working capital of 893,886
 compared with the positive working capital of 1,106,522 as of August 31, 2023. The drop in working capital for the comparative
figures was mainly attributable to the decrease in cash proceeds from issuance of common stock or capital contribution, decrease in deposits,
prepayments and other receivables, increase in accounts payable and accruals and the increase in amount owing to shareholders. 

The decline in working capital underscores the Company s
strategic use of resources to support ongoing operations and investments during a critical growth phase. Management is actively monitoring
the Company s liquidity position and evaluating strategies to enhance working capital and ensure sustainable financial stability.

The Company generated net cash from operating activities
of 30,822 for FYE 2024, compared to a net cash outflow of 1,674,395 in FYE 2023. 

The improvement in cash flow from operating activities
mainly attributable to a reduction of 170,431 in inventory levels, significant decreases in
deposits, prepayments, and advances to suppliers, contributing 502,701 to cash flow and increased support from shareholders, with amounts
due to shareholders rising by 970,597. 

These improvements were partially offset by reductions in deferred revenue
and increased accounts payable and accruals. As of August 31, 2024, the Company s cash and cash equivalents stood at 152,985. The
improved operating cash flow reflects the Company s ongoing efforts to optimize cost efficiency positioning it for sustainable growth. 

During the FYE 2024, cash used in investing activities amounted to 146,269.
This was primarily attributable to capital expenditures for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, reflecting the company s
continued investments in operational infrastructure to support its long-term growth stategy. 

Cash used in financing activities for FYE 2024 totaled 456,253, consisting
of 6,677 for hire purchase payments and 449,576 related to the payment of offering cots. 

Seasonality 

The
Company s business is not subject to seasonality. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements. 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Revenue
recognition 

Our
revenue recognition policy is in compliance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers whereby revenue is recognized
when a customer obtains control of promised goods and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive
in exchange for those goods. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that we expect
to receive in exchange for those goods. We apply the following five-step model to determine this amount: 

(i) 
 identification
 of the promised goods and services in the contract; 

(ii) 
 determination
 of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the
 contract; 

(iii) 
 measurement
 of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; 

(iv) 
 allocation
 of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 

(v) 
 recognition
 of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

30 | Page 

We
only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange
for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception,
we review the contract to determine which performance obligations we must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct.
We recognize as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance
obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, our performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time,
typically upon delivery for local sales and upon shipment of the products for export sale. 

For
all reporting periods, we have not disclosed the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all product revenue contracts with
an original expected length of one year or less, which is an optional exemption that is permitted under the adopted rules. 

Estimates
and Assumptions 

In
preparing our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures.
Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities, and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that are
inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
from estimated amounts. Significant estimates in FYE 2024 and 2023 include the assumptions used to value tax liabilities, derivative
financial instruments, estimates of the allowance for deferred tax assets, accounts receivable allowance, impairment of long-lived
assets and inventory write-offs. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company s financial statements as of August 31, 2024, is prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP 
applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company has not yet established a sustainable ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and
allow it to continue as a going concern. 

As
of August 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 39,401,857 and 13,523,266 respectively. The Company incurred
net loss of 26,315,396 and 6,317,373 for the years ended August 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The cash generated from operating
activities was 30,822 for the year ended August 31, 2024, the cash used in operating activities was 1,674,395 for the year ended August
31, 2023. It was brought to the attention of the Management to assess going concern considering all facts and circumstances about the
foreseeable future of the Company as well as its assets and liabilities on the basis that it will be able to realize and discharge them
in the normal course of business. 

To address these challenges and ensure the Company s
long-term viability, Management has developed a strategic plan focused on the continued development and expansion of its HVAC business.
Key initiatives include: 

Expansion of Product Offerings: Broadening the range of HVAC products to meet diverse market needs. 
 
 Geographical Expansion: Penetrating new markets to drive revenue growth. 
 
 Revenue Diversification: Expanding customer segments across retail, commercial, industrial, and project-based
clients, as well as private label and licensing opportunities. 
 
 Improved Profitability: Achieving economies of scale through operational efficiencies and growth. 

Additionally, the Company is actively pursuing plans
to raise additional funding to support operations and business expansion. This includes preparations to uplist on the Nasdaq Capital Market,
which is expected to enhance access to capital and further strengthen the Company s financial position. 

The consolidated financial have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and accordingly financial statements do not include any adjustments
related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern . 

Material
Commitments 

We
have no material commitments as of August 31, 2024.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
 Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt
instruments and convertible preferred stock and amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity s
own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related earnings
per share guidance. This standard becomes effective for the Company beginning on October 1, 2024. Adoption is either a modified retrospective
method or a fully retrospective method of transition. The Company adopted this guidance effective September 1, 2023, and the adoption
of this standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 provides guidance for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on
an estimate of current expected credit losses model. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
Recently, the FASB issued the final ASU to delay adoption for smaller reporting companies for discal years beginning after December 15,
2022. We adopted ASU 2016-13 on September 1, 2023, and it did not have a material impact on out consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements Unadopted 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvement to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU aims to improve segment disclosures
through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard requires disclosure of significant expense categories and
amounts for such expenses, including those segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, easily
computable from information that is regularly provided, or significant expenses that are expressed in a form other than actual amounts.
This standard will be effective for the Company in Fiscal Year 2025 and is required to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods
presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the additional disclosure requirements on the
Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, a final standard on improvements to income tax disclosures
which applies to all entities subject to income taxes. The standard requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity s
effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing
more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. This standard will be effective for
the Company in Fiscal Year 2026 and should be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the additional
disclosure requirements on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by Management to have a material impact on the Company s
present or future financial statements.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of EvoAir Holdings Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EvoAir Holdings Inc. (the Company as of August 31, 2024
and 2023, the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the two years ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements and schedule (collectively,
the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended August 31,
2024 and 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going concern uncertainty 

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As disclosed in Note 3 to the
financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 39,401,857. The Company incurred net loss of 26,315,396 for the
year ended August 31, 2024. The cash generated from operating activities was 30,822 for the year ended August 31, 2024. The
Company has accumulated losses since inception which raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024. Based on our management s evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, our management concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms. 

A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In
connection with the assessment described above, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material
weaknesses at August 31, 2024: 

Due
 to our limited resources, we do not have enough accounting personnel with extensive experience in maintaining books and records and
 preparing financial statements in accordance with US GAAP which could lead to untimely identification and resolution of accounting
 matters inherent in our financial transactions in accordance with US GAAP. 

The
 Company has insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting, which led to inadequate financial
 statement closing process. 

The
 Company has a lack of segregation of duties, a lack of audit committee or independent governance/oversight. 

Our
management also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year August 31, 2024
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
