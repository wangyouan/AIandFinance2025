statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ from those indicated in the forward-looking
statements include, among others, those discussed below and under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K. 

General 

Magyar Bancorp, Inc. (the
 Company is a Delaware-chartered corporation which owns 100 of the outstanding shares of common stock of Magyar Bank. At
September 30, 2024, Magyar Bancorp, Inc. had consolidated assets of 951.9 million, total deposits of 796.7 million and stockholders 
equity of 110.5 million. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. has not engaged in any significant business activity other than owning all of the shares
of common stock of Magyar Bank. The executive office of Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is located at 400 Somerset Street, New Brunswick, New Jersey
08901, and its telephone number is (732) 342-7600. 

Magyar Bank is a New Jersey-chartered
savings bank headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey that was originally founded in 1922. We conduct business from our main office
located at 400 Somerset Street, New Brunswick, New Jersey, and our eight branch offices located in New Brunswick, North Brunswick, South
Brunswick, Branchburg, Bridgewater, Edison and Martinsville, New Jersey. The telephone number at our main office is (732) 342-7600 and
our website is located at www.magbank.com. Information on our website is not and should not be considered
a part of this Annual Report. 

Our principal business consists
of attracting retail deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding our main office in New Brunswick, New Jersey and our branch
offices located in Middlesex and Somerset Counties, New Jersey, and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations
and wholesale funding, in commercial real estate loans, residential mortgage loans, commercial business loans, Small Business Administration SBA loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, construction and land loans and investment securities. Our
revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and securities; our investment securities consist primarily of mortgage-backed
securities and U.S. Government and government-sponsored enterprise obligations. We also generate revenues from fees and service charges.
Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings and principal and interest payments on loans and securities. We are subject to comprehensive
regulation and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance NJDBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation FDIC ). 

2 

Market Area 

We are headquartered in New
Brunswick, New Jersey, and our primary deposit market area is concentrated in the communities surrounding our headquarters branch and
our branch offices located in Middlesex and Somerset Counties, New Jersey. Our primary lending market area is broader than our deposit
market area and includes all of New Jersey. 

The economy of our primary
market area is largely urban and suburban with a broad economic base that is typical for counties surrounding the New York metropolitan
area. The median household income in Middlesex and Somerset Counties ranks among the highest in the nation. 

Most of the Bank s customers
are individuals and small to medium-sized businesses which are dependent upon the regional economy. Adverse changes in economic and business
conditions in the Bank s markets could adversely affect the Bank s borrowers, their ability to repay their loans and to borrow
additional funds, and consequently the Bank s financial condition and performance. The majority of the Bank s loans are secured
by real estate located in New Jersey. A decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the values of such real estate. Consequently,
a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on the Bank s earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital
of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse. 

Competition 

We face intense competition
within our market area both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions
including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Some of our competitors offer products and services
that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation s
annual Summary of Deposit report, at June 30, 2024, our market share of deposits was 1.52 and 0.38 in Middlesex and Somerset
Counties, respectively. Our market share of deposits was 1.26 and 0.38 , respectively, at June 30, 2023. 

Our competition for loans
and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms and credit unions. We face additional
competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. Our primary focus
is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business while maintaining our role as a community bank. 

Lending Activities 

Our lending relationships
are primarily with small to mid-sized businesses and individual consumers residing primarily in and around central and northern New Jersey.
We primarily originate commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent home equity lines of credit,
commercial business and construction and land loans.

One-to Four-Family Residential
Loans. We originate residential mortgage loans, most of which are secured by properties located in our primary market area and
most of which we hold in portfolio. At September 30, 2024, 246.2 million, or 31.5 of our total loan portfolio, consisted of residential
mortgage loans. Generally, residential mortgage loans are originated in amounts up to 80 of the lesser
of the appraised value or purchase price of the property, with private mortgage insurance required on loans with a loan-to-value ratio
in excess of 80 . 

Generally, all residential
mortgage loans are underwritten according to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac guidelines, policies and
procedures. Historically, we have not originated a significant number of loans for the purpose of reselling them in the secondary market. 

We also originate home equity
loans secured by residences located in our market area. The underwriting standards we use for home equity loans include a determination
of the applicant s credit history, an assessment of the applicant s ability to meet existing obligations, the ongoing payments
on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. 

At September 30, 2024, we
had 144.0 million of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, which represented 58.5 of our total residential mortgage loan portfolio.
At September 30, 2024, our largest fixed-rate residential mortgage loan was 9.9 million. The loan was performing in accordance with its
contractual repayment terms at September 30, 2024. 

At September 30, 2024, adjustable-rate
residential mortgage loans totaled 102.2 million, or 41.5 of our total residential mortgage loan portfolio. The largest adjustable-rate
residential mortgage loan was for 2.2 million. The loan was performing in accordance with its contractual repayment terms at September
30, 2024. 

Commercial Real Estate
Loans. We also originate commercial real estate loans, most of which are secured by properties located in our primary market area.
At September 30, 2024, 461.3 million, or 59.1 , of our total loan portfolio consisted of these types of loans. Commercial real estate
loans are generally secured by five-or-more-unit apartment buildings, industrial properties and properties used for business purposes
such as small office buildings, warehouses and retail facilities. We generally originate adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans
with a maximum term of 25 years with 

4 

adjustable-rate periods every five years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for our commercial real
estate loans is 75 , based on the appraised value of the property. 

We consider a number of factors
when we originate commercial real estate loans. During the underwriting process we evaluate the business qualifications and financial
condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability of the property being financed, as well as the value and condition
of the mortgaged property securing the loan. When evaluating the business qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources
of the borrower, the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s payment history with
us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, we consider the net operating income of the mortgaged
property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt
service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure it is at least 120 of the monthly debt service. 

Loans secured by commercial
real estate generally are larger than residential mortgage loans and involve greater credit risk. Commercial real estate loans often involve
large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Repayment of these loans depends to a large degree on the results
of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property, and may be affected to
a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, the nature of these loans makes
them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate. 

Construction and Land
Loans. We also originate construction and land acquisition loans for the development of one-to four-family homes, apartment buildings
and commercial properties. Construction and land loans are generally offered to experienced local developers operating in our primary
market area and to individuals for the construction of their personal residences. At September 30, 2024, our construction and land loans
totaled 22.7 million, or 2.9 of total loans. 

Construction and land loans
generally have a maximum term of 24 months. We provide financing for land acquisition, site improvement and hard construction costs. Land
acquisition loans are limited to 50 of the sale price or appraised value of the land, whichever is lower. Site improvement loans are
limited to 100 of the bonded site improvement costs. Construction loans are limited to 75 of the lesser of the contract sale price or
appraised value of the property. 

Construction and land lending
is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk
of loss on a construction and land loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion
of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction
cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property.
Additionally, if our estimate of the value of the completed property is inaccurate, our construction and land loan may exceed the value
of the collateral. The advantages of construction lending are that the market is typically less competitive than standard mortgage products,
the interest rate typically charged is a variable rate, which permits the Bank to protect against sudden changes in its costs of funds,
the interest rate is typically higher to reflect the higher degree of credit risk, and the origination fees charged by the Bank to its
customers can be amortized over the shorter term of a construction loan, typically, one to two years, which permits the Bank to recognize
fees as income over a shorter period of time. 

Home Equity Loans and
Lines of Credit and Other Loans. We originate home equity lines of credit secured by residences located in our market area. At
September 30, 2024, these loans totaled 24.7 million, or 3.2 of our total loan portfolio. The underwriting standards we use for home
equity lines of credit include a determination of the applicant s credit history, an assessment of the applicant s ability
to meet existing obligations, the ongoing payments on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. The maximum
combined (first and second mortgage liens) loan-to-value ratio for home equity lines of credit is 80 . Home equity lines of credit have
adjustable rates of interest, indexed to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal , with terms of up to 25 years. 

We also originate loans secured
by the common stock of publicly traded companies, provided their shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock
Market. Stock-secured loans are interest-only and are offered for terms up to twelve months and for adjustable rates of interest indexed
to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal. The loan amount is not to exceed 70 of the value of the stock securing
the loan at any time. At September 30, 2024, stock-secured and other loans totaled 2.1 million, or 0.3 of our total net loan portfolio. 

Commercial Business
Loans. We make commercial business loans primarily in our market area to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships and
small and mid-sized businesses. Our commercial business loans include term loans 

5 

and revolving lines of credit. At September 30, 2024,
our commercial business loans totaled 24.0 million, or 3.1 of total loans. 

The maximum term of a commercial
business loan is 25 years. Such loans are generally used for longer-term working capital purposes such as purchasing equipment or furniture.
Commercial business loans are made with either adjustable or fixed rates of interest. 

Included in commercial business
loans are Small Business Administration SBA 7(a) loans, on which the SBA provides guarantees of up to 75 of the principal
balance (85 for loans under 150,000). These loans are made for the purposes of providing working capital and financing the purchase
of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate, and may be made inside or outside the State of New Jersey. At September 30, 2024, 14.9
million, or 95.2 of the Company s SBA loan balances, were to businesses located in the State of New Jersey. Generally, an SBA 7(a)
loan has a deficiency in its credit profile that would not allow the borrower to qualify for a traditional commercial loan, which is why
the government provides the guarantee. The deficiency may be a higher loan to value ratio, lower debt service coverage ratio or weaker
personal financial guarantees. In addition, many SBA 7(a) loans are for start-up businesses where there is no history of financial information.
Finally, many SBA borrowers do not have an ongoing and continuous banking relationship with the Bank, but merely work with the Bank on
a single transaction. We generally sell the guaranteed portions of these SBA loans in the secondary market. 

Commercial business loans
generally have greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the
basis of the borrower s ability to repay the loan from his or her employment income, and which are secured by real property with
ascertainable value, commercial business loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to repay the loan from
the cash flow of the borrower s business. As a result, the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the
success of the borrower s business. As such the performance of these types of loans may be particularly sensitive to local and/or
national economic conditions. Further, any collateral securing commercial business loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to
appraise and may fluctuate in value. We try to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards. 

Loans to One Borrower
and Concentration of Loans. The maximum amount of loans to one borrower is limited by our Board-established loans-to-one-borrower
limit, which is currently 15 of Magyar Bank s capital, or 17.2 million. At September 30, 2024, our largest loan was 13.2 million
commercial real estate loan to finance the purchase and operation of a nursing and rehabilitation home in Edison, New Jersey. The loan
was performing in accordance with its terms at September 30, 2024. 

The size of loans which the
Bank can offer to potential borrowers is less than the size of loans which many of the Bank s competitors with larger capitalization
are able to offer. The Bank may engage in loan participations with other banks for loans in excess of the Bank s legal lending limits.
However, no assurance can be given that such participations will be available at all or on terms which are favorable to the Bank and its
customers. 

The Bank has established policies
to determine and monitor concentrations of credit risk and to maintain discipline in lending practices with a focus on portfolio diversification. 

Asset Quality 

We commence collection efforts
when a loan becomes 15 days past due with system-generated reminder notices. Subsequent late charge and delinquent notices are issued
and the account is monitored on a regular basis thereafter. Personal, direct contact with the borrower is attempted early in the collection
process as a courtesy reminder and later to determine the reason for the delinquency and to safeguard our collateral. When a loan is more
than 60 days past due, the credit file is reviewed and, if deemed necessary, information is updated or confirmed and collateral re-evaluated.
We make every effort to contact the borrower and develop a plan of repayment to cure the delinquency. Loans are placed on non-accrual
status when they are delinquent for more than 90 days. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed,
and further income is recognized only to the extent received. 

A summary report of all loans
30 days or more past due is provided to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. If no repayment plan is in process, the file is referred
to counsel for the commencement of foreclosure and/or other collection efforts. 

6 

Non-Performing Assets.
 Non-accrual loans are loans on which the accrual of interest has ceased. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status if,
in the opinion of management, collection is doubtful, or when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more. Interest accrued, but
not collected at the date a loan is placed on non-accrual status, is reversed and charged against interest income. Subsequent cash receipts
are applied either to the outstanding principal or recorded as interest income, depending on management s assessment of ultimate
collectability of principal and interest. Loans are returned to an accrual status when the borrower s ability to make periodic principal
and interest payments has returned to normal (i.e., brought current with respect to principal or interest or restructured) and the paying
capacity of the borrower and/or the underlying collateral is deemed sufficient to cover principal and interest. 

The following table sets forth
the amounts and categories of our non-accrual assets at the dates indicated.

A loan is considered individually
evaluated when it has been modified for a borrower in financial distress or when, based on current information and events, it is probable
that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of
the loan agreement. Individually evaluated loans that have been modified are measured based on the present value of expected future discounted
cash flows, the market price of the loan or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. 

We record cash receipts on
individually evaluated loans that are non-performing as a reduction to principal before applying amounts to interest or late charges unless
specifically directed by the Bankruptcy Court to apply payments otherwise. 

Delinquent Loans .
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our loan portfolio delinquencies at the dates indicated. Loans delinquent
more than three months are generally classified as non-accrual loans.

Real Estate Owned .
Real estate we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned OREO until sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at fair value less estimated cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing
a new cost basis. Holding costs and declines in fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition. 

We held three properties consisting
of two residential single-family homes and one commercial real estate property totaling 3.7 million at September 30, 2024, an increase
of 3.4 million, or 1035.7 from 328 thousand at September 30, 2023. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Financial
assets measured at amortized cost should be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses
that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The allowance for credit losses ACL reflects management's current estimate
of credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of a financial asset. The income statement will be affected for the
measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit
losses that have taken place during the period. 

ACL on Loans. The
Company maintains its ACL on loans at a level that management believes to be appropriate to absorb estimated credit losses as of the date
of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ACL is a valuation reserve established and maintained by charges against income. Loans, or portions
thereof, are charged-off against the ACL when they are deemed uncollectible. The ACL is an estimate of expected credit losses that considers
our historical loss experience, the weighted average expected lives of loans, current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic
conditions. The determination of an appropriate ACL is inherently subjective and may have significant changes from period to period. The
methodology for determining the ACL has two main components: evaluation of expected credit losses for certain groups of homogeneous loans
that share similar risk characteristics and evaluation of loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans. The ACL is measured
on a collective (pool) basis when similar characteristics exist. The Company s loan portfolio is segmented by loan types that have
similar risk characteristics and behave similarly during economic cycles. 

The ACL for individual loans
begins with the use of normal credit review procedures to identify whether a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other
pooled loans and, therefore, should be individually assessed. We individually evaluate loans that meet the following criteria: (1) when
it is determined that foreclosure is probable, (2) substandard, doubtful and nonperforming loans when repayment is expected to be provided
substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, or (3) when it is determined by management that a loan does not share similar
risk characteristics with other loans. Credit loss estimates are calculated based on the following three acceptable methods for measuring
the ACL: (1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate; (2) the
loan s observable market price; or (3) the fair value of the collateral when the loan is collateral dependent. Our individual loan
evaluations consist primarily of the fair value of collateral method because most of our loans are collateral dependent. Collateral values
are reduced to consider expected disposition costs when appropriate. A charge-off is recorded when the estimated fair value of the loan
is less than the loan balance. 

ACL on Unfunded Loan
Commitments. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Bank is exposed to credit risk
via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Bank. The ACL on unfunded loan
commitments is included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets and is adjusted through
credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur, the amount of funding that will occur
and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.

Investments 

Our Board of Directors has
adopted our Investment Policy. This policy determines the types of securities in which we may invest. The Investment Policy is reviewed
annually by the Board of Directors and changes to the policy are subject to approval by our Board of Directors. While general investment
strategies are developed by the Asset and Liability Committee, the execution of specific actions rests primarily with our President and
our Chief Financial Officer. They are responsible for ensuring the guidelines and requirements included in the Investment Policy are followed.
They are authorized to execute transactions that fall within the scope of the established Investment Policy up to 5.0 million per transaction
individually or 10.0 million per transaction jointly. Investment transactions in excess of 10.0 million must be approved by the Asset
and Liability Committee. Investment transactions are reviewed and ratified by the Board of Directors at their regularly scheduled meetings. 

Our investments portfolio
may include U.S. Treasury obligations, debt and equity securities issued by various government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and short-term
loans to other banks, investment-grade corporate debt instruments, and municipal debt securities. In addition, we may invest in equity
securities subject to certain limitations and not in excess of Magyar Bank s Tier 1 capital. 

9 

The Investment Policy requires
that securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner, and purchase and sale decisions be based upon a thorough analysis
of each security to determine its quality and inherent risks and fit within our overall asset/liability management objectives. The analysis
must consider the effect of an investment or sale on our risk-based capital and prospects for yield and appreciation. 

Portfolio Maturities
and Yields. The maturities and weighted average yields of the investment debt securities portfolio and the mortgage-backed securities
portfolio at September 30, 2024 are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and
do not reflect the impact of prepayments or early redemptions that may occur. The weighted average yield is determined using a yield calculated
from the contractual interest rate adjusted for the amortization/accretion of premium/discount paid to purchase the security, if any,
expected to be recognized during its average life. Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis.

Sources of Funds 

General. Deposits,
including certificates of deposit, demand, savings, NOW and money market accounts, have traditionally been the primary source of funds
used for our lending and investment activities. We obtain certificates of deposit primarily through our branch network and to a lesser
extent via the brokered CD market. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank advances, to supplement cash flow needs, to
lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management and to manage our cost of funds. Additional sources of funds
include principal and interest payments from loans and securities, loan and security prepayments and maturities, income on other earning
assets and stockholders equity. While cash flows from loans and securities payments can be relatively stable sources of funds,
deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 

Deposits. Our
deposits are generated primarily from customers within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including demand
accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms
vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest
rate. We also accept brokered deposits when attractive rates and terms are available. At September 30, 2024, we had 29.6 million in brokered
deposits. 

The flow of deposits is influenced
significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety
of deposit accounts offered allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on experience,
we believe that our deposits are relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits, and the rates paid on these
deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. 

The following table sets forth
the distribution of total deposit accounts, by account type, at the dates indicated.

Subsidiary Activities 

The
Company's only subsidiary is the Bank. The Bank holds three subsidiaries as described below. 

Magyar Investment Company
is a New Jersey investment corporation subsidiary for the purpose of buying, selling and holding investment securities. The income earned
on Magyar Investment Company s investment securities are subject to a lower state tax than that assessed on income earned on investment
securities maintained at Magyar Bank. 

Hungaria Urban Renewal, LLC
is a Delaware limited-liability corporation established in 2002 as a qualified intermediary operating for the purpose of acquiring and
developing Magyar Bank s main office. In 2006, Magyar Bank acquired a 100 interest in Hungaria Urban Renewal, LLC, which has no
other business other than owning Magyar Bank s main office site. As part of a tax abatement agreement with the City of New Brunswick,
Magyar Bank s main office will remain in Hungaria Urban Renewal, LLC s name. 

Magyar Service Corporation,
a New Jersey corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Magyar Bank. Magyar Service Corporation offers Magyar Bank customers and others
a complete range of non-deposit investment products and 

11 

financial planning services, including insurance products, fixed and variable
annuities, and retirement planning for individual and commercial customers. 

Employees and Human Capital
Resources 

At September 30, 2024 we employed
91 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes
that we have good relations with our employees. 

Employee retention helps us
operate efficiently and achieve one of our business objectives, which is being a high-level service provider. We believe our commitment
to living out our core values, actively prioritizing concern for our employees well-being, supporting our employees career
goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits aids in retention of our top-performing employees. In addition,
nearly all of our employees are stockholders of the Company through participation in our Employee Stock Ownership Plan, which aligns associate
and stockholder interests by providing stock ownership on a tax-deferred basis at no investment cost to our associates. At September 30,
2024, 35 of our current staff had been with us for ten years or more. 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

General 

Magyar Bank is a New Jersey-chartered
savings bank, and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF ). Magyar Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the
Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the Commissioner as the issuer of its charter, and
by the FDIC as deposit insurer and its primary federal regulator. Magyar Bank must file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning
its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers
with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices. The Commissioner and the FDIC conduct
periodic examinations to assess Magyar Bank s compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes
a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and
depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and
enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment
of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 

Magyar Bancorp, Inc., as
a bank holding company controlling Magyar Bank, is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHCA ), the
rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Bank (the FRB under the BHCA the provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act
of 1948 (the New Jersey Banking Act ), and to the regulations of the Commissioner under the New Jersey Banking Act applicable
to bank holding companies. Magyar Bank and Magyar Bancorp, Inc. are required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules
and regulations of the FRB and the Commissioner. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with,
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 

Any change in such laws and
regulations, whether by the Commissioner, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact
on Magyar Bank and Magyar Bancorp, Inc. and their operations and stockholders. 

Certain of the laws and regulations
applicable to Magyar Bank and Magyar Bancorp, Inc. are summarized below. These summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified
in their entirety by reference to such laws and regulations. 

New Jersey Banking Regulation 

Activity Powers. 
Magyar Bank derives its lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking
Act and its related regulations. 

Loans-to-One-Borrower
Limitations. With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey-chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single
borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15 of the bank s capital funds. A savings
bank may lend an additional 10 of the bank s capital funds if secured 

12 

by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey
Banking Act. Magyar Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations. 

Dividends. Under
the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment
of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank. In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless
the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50 of its capital stock, or alternatively,
the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus. Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Magyar
Bank. See Federal Banking Regulation-Prompt Corrective Action below. 

Minimum Capital Requirements. 
Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey-chartered depository institutions, including Magyar Bank, minimum capital requirements
similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks. See Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements. 

Examination and Enforcement. 
The NJDBI may examine Magyar Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable. The NJDBI examines Magyar Bank at least every three years.
The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct
any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered
the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed. The Commissioner
also has authority to appoint a conservator or receiver for a savings bank under certain circumstances such as insolvency or unsafe or
unsound condition to transact business. 

Federal Banking Regulation 

Capital Requirements.
 Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier
1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio, and a Tier
1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. 

The capital standards require
the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 ,
6 and 8 , respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4 Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as
common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier
1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests
in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier
1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements,
and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred
stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 
of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income AOCI ), up to 45 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair
market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including
unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions
and adjustments specified in the regulations. 

In determining the amount
of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets
(e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations
based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present
greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0 is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50 is generally assigned
to prudently underwritten first lien one-to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100 is assigned to commercial and consumer
loans, a risk weight of 150 is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0 to 600 is assigned to permissible
equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 

In addition to establishing
the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management
if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted
asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 

13 

At September 30, 2024, Magyar
Bank s common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio was 14.75 , total capital to risk-based assets ratio was 15.85 ,
and Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio was 11.11 . At September 30, 2023, Magyar Bank s common equity Tier 1 capital
to risk-based assets ratio was 14.97 , total capital to risk-based assets ratio was 16.22 , and Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage
ratio was 11.11 . 

Prompt Corrective Action. 
Federal bank regulatory authorities are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not
meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the applicable statute establishes five capital categories. An institution is deemed
to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
of 8.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or greater. An institution is adequately
capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater,
a leverage ratio of 4.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5 or greater. An institution is undercapitalized 
if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a leverage ratio of
less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 . An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized 
if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , a leverage ratio of
less than 3.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 . An institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized 
if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . Effective March
31, 2020, qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio framework and that maintain a
leverage ratio of greater than 9.0 will be considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements to be deemed
well-capitalized. 

Undercapitalized institutions
are subject to a variety of mandatory supervisory measures including the requirement to file a capital plan for the FDIC s approval
and dividend restrictions as well as other discretionary actions by the regulator. 

Federal Home Loan Bank
System. Magyar Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which consists of eleven regional federal home loan banks,
each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The federal home loan banks provide a central credit
facility primarily for member thrift institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. Magyar Bank, as a member
of the FHLBNY, is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLBNY in specified amounts. 

As of September 30, 2024,
Magyar Bank was in compliance with these requirements. 

Enforcement. 
The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including Magyar Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among
other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general,
these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, unsafe or unsound practices or non-compliance
with agency conditions or agreements. 

Deposit Insurance. 
The DIF of the FDIC insures deposits at Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured financial institutions such as Magyar Bank generally
up to a maximum of 250 thousand per separately insured depositor. 

Under
the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations,
regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution s risk category and certain specified
risk adjustments. Institutions deemed to be less risky pay lower rates while institutions deemed riskier pay higher rates. Assessment
rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 2.5 to 32 basis points of each institution s total assets less tangible
capital. 

Insurance
of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe
or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
The Bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its
deposit insurance. 

Brokered
Deposits. Applicable law and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept,
renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution s capital category is well capitalized or, upon application
to and a waiver from the FDIC, adequately capitalized. Less-than-well-capitalized banks also are subject to restrictions
on the interest rates that they may pay on deposits. The characterization of deposits as brokered may result in the imposition
of higher deposit assessments on such deposits. The FDIC s brokered deposit regulations provide a limited exception for reciprocal
deposits for banks that are well managed and well capitalized (or adequately capitalized and have obtained a waiver from the FDIC as mentioned
above). Under the limited exception, qualified banks are able to exempt from treatment as brokered deposits up to 5 billion
or 20 of the institution s total liabilities in reciprocal deposits. 

14 

Transactions with Affiliates
of Magyar Bank. Magyar Bank s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B
of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing Regulation W promulgated by the FRB. An affiliate includes, among other things, a company
that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution, such as Magyar Bancorp, Inc. In general,
 covered transactions, as defined by these authorities, between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are
subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements. In this regard, covered transactions between an insured depository institution
and its affiliates are limited to 10 of the institution s capital stock and surplus for transactions with any one affiliate, and
20 of the institution s capital stock and surplus for transactions in the aggregate with all affiliates. Collateral of specific
types and in specified amounts ranging from 100 to 130 of the amount of the transaction must usually be provided by affiliates for a
savings bank to engage in a credit transaction with them. In addition, covered transactions with affiliates must be on terms
and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and generally may not involve low-quality assets. Transactions with affiliates
must generally be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution, as comparable
transactions involving non-affiliates. Magyar Bank is currently in compliance with these requirements. 

Prohibitions Against
Tying Arrangements. Banks are subject to the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1972 on certain tying arrangements. A depository
institution is prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the
consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution
or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 

Community Reinvestment
Act. All FDIC-insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act CRA and related
regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its
examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution s record of compliance with the CRA. 

In 2023, the FDIC, the
FRB, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a final rule to strengthen and modernize the CRA regulations. Under the
final rule, banks with assets of at least 600 million as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years and less than 2 billion
as of December 31 in either of the prior two calendar years will be an intermediate bank. The agencies will evaluate intermediate
banks under the Retail Lending Test and either the current community development test, referred to in the final rule as the Intermediate
Bank Community Development Test, or, at the bank s option, the Community Development Financing Test. The applicability date for
the majority of the provisions in the CRA regulations is January 1, 2026, and additional requirements will be applicable on January 1,
2027. 

An institution s failure
to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. We received an Outstanding 
CRA rating in our most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC in 2022. 

The Bank Secrecy Act
and USA PATRIOT Act . The Bank Secrecy Act BSA and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 USA PATRIOT Act require Magyar Bank to implement a compliance
program to detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and illicit crime. Together, the BSA and USA PATRIOT Act require
Magyar Bank to implement internal controls, conduct customer due diligence, maintain records, and file reports. The USA PATRIOT Act also
required the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money laundering activities
in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition,
our controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies,
procedures and systems designed to comply with the BSA, USA PATRIOT Act, and regulations implemented thereunder. 

Cyber Security .
 The federal banking agencies have adopted rules providing for new notification requirements for banking organizations and their service
providers for significant cybersecurity incidents. Specifically, the new rules require a banking organization to notify its primary federal
regulator as soon as possible, and no later than 36 hours after, the banking organization determines that a computer-security incident 
rising to the level of a notification incident has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the viability of a banking organization s operations, its ability to deliver
banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule to notify affected
banking organization customers as soon as possible when the 

15 

provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that
has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the banking organization s customers for four or more hours. 

Consumer Protection .
Magyar Bank and Magyar Bancorp are subject to federal and state fair lending laws. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing
Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. In addition,
Magyar Bank and Magyar Bancorp are subject to other federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and prohibit unfair, deceptive
or abusive business practices, including the Home Ownership Protection Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate
Credit Transactions Act of 2003, the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and various state law counterparts. These laws and regulations mandate certain
disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must interact with clients when taking deposits, making
loans, collecting and servicing loans and providing other services. Further, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad authority
to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts and practices and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft
model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement
actions, fines and other penalties. The failure to comply with these laws could result in enforcement actions by the federal banking agencies,
as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 

Privacy Regulations .
Federal regulations generally require that Magyar Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer s
 non-public personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.
In addition, Magyar Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having their personal information
shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing
purposes. Except as otherwise required or permitted by law, Magyar Bank is prohibited from disclosing such information. Magyar Bank currently
has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations. 

Loans to a Bank s
Insiders 

Federal Regulation. 
A bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10 or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any entities controlled
by any such person (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the
Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the
insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to member banks, which is comparable to the
loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to Magyar Bank s loans. See New Jersey Banking Regulation Loans-to-One Borrower
Limitations. All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s
unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education
of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence, may not exceed the greater of 25 thousand
or 2.5 of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus, and in no event more than 100 thousand. Federal regulation also requires
that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the Board of Directors
of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that
insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed the greater of 25 thousand or 5 of the bank s unimpaired capital
and surplus. Generally, loans to an insider s related interests must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit
underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other
persons. 

An exception is made for extensions
of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not
give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank. 

In addition, federal law prohibits
extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking
relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavourable features. 

New Jersey Regulation. 
Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities to a savings bank of its directors and executive
officers and of corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons, that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations
imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under federal law, as discussed above. The New Jersey
Banking Act also provides that 

16 

a savings bank that is in compliance with federal law is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions
of the New Jersey Banking Act. 

Federal Reserve System 

Savings banks, such as Magyar
Bank, are authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. Magyar Bank is deemed by the FRB to be generally
sound and thus is eligible to obtain secondary credit from its FRB. Generally, secondary credit is extended on a very short-term basis
to meet the liquidity needs of the institution. Loans must be secured by acceptable collateral and carry a rate of interest above the
Federal Open Market Committee s federal funds target rate. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties
at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the
securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with this Act and its implementing regulations, and we review
and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance. 

Holding Company Regulation 

Federal Regulation. 
Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is regulated as a bank holding company. Bank holding companies are subject to examination, regulation and periodic
reporting under the BHCA, as administered by the FRB. Bank holding companies are generally subject to consolidated capital requirements
established by the FRB. Bank holding companies under 3.0 billion in consolidated assets remain exempt from consolidated regulatory capital
requirements, unless the FRB determines otherwise in particular cases. 

Regulations of the FRB provide
that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an
unsafe or unsound manner. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy and required the promulgation of implementing regulations.
Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank
would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank. See
 Federal Banking Regulation Prompt Corrective Action. If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital
restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized
bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the FRB. 

As a bank holding company,
Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank
or bank holding company. Prior FRB approval is required for Magyar Bancorp, Inc. to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of
any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly,
own or control more than 5 of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company. 

Under federal law, depository
institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled
depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. This law would be applicable
potentially to Magyar Bancorp, Inc. if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to Magyar Bank. 

In connection with the
mutual-to-stock conversion of Magyar Bancorp, MHC, eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account
holders received an interest in liquidation accounts maintained by the Company and the Bank in an aggregate amount equal to
(a) Magyar Bancorp, MHC s ownership interest in the Company s total stockholders equity as of the date of the
latest Statement of Balance Sheet included in the offering prospectus for the conversion, plus (b) the value of the net assets of
Magyar Bancorp, MHC as of the date of the latest Statement of Balance Sheet of Magyar Bancorp, MHC before the consummation of
the conversion (excluding its ownership of the Company). The Company and the Bank hold the liquidation accounts for the benefit of
eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders who continue to maintain deposits in the Bank after the
conversion. The liquidation accounts are intended to preserve for eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders
who continue to maintain their deposit accounts with the Bank a liquidation interest in the residual net worth, if any, of the Bank
(after the payment of all creditors, including depositors to the full extent of their deposit accounts) in the event of a
liquidation of (a) the Company and the Bank or (b) the Bank . 

17 

New Jersey Regulation. 
Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company. The New Jersey
Banking Act defines the terms company and bank holding company as such terms are defined under the BHCA. Each
bank holding company controlling a New Jersey-chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject
to examination by the Commissioner. 

Acquisition of Magyar
Bancorp, Inc. Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of Magyar Bancorp, Inc. without
first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control by the FRB and the Commissioner. 

Federal Securities Laws.
 Magyar Bancorp, Inc. common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

current cybersecurity threats, and ongoing cybersecurity issues and threats. The IT Director provides an IT status report to the Board
of Directors on a Monthly basis. 

The Company
has adopted an Incident Response Plan (the Plan to monitor, detect, mitigate and remediate cybersecurity incidents. The
Plan requires that business unit management have a working knowledge of the Company s Information Security Program and Incident
Response Policies. Pursuant to the Plan, the IT Director identifies information owners for sensitive customer information and creates
an incident response team. Each Department Manager, upon notification of a potential unauthorized access, manipulation of data or theft
of any item identified under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLBA Inventory and Asset Classification, is responsible for
further assessing the situation in order to document the suspected or actual breach, and forward the appropriate documentation to IT Management.
The documentation of the suspected or actual incident includes the following: 

(a) Identify
the nature and scope of the incident; 

(b) Identify
the information systems affected; 

(c) Identify
the types of customer information potentially affected. 

Once
the Incident Response Team has determined that unauthorized access, manipulation of data or theft of any item identified under GLBA Inventory
and Asset Classification has occurred, Executive Management, the Information Security Officer, the Compliance Officer and the Information
Technology Management must be contacted immediately. 

If
theft of any item identified under GLBA Inventory and Asset Classification has occurred, and it cannot be determined what specific information
was included on the Asset, the Asset is treated as if it contained sensitive customer information and Senior Management, the Information
Security Officer, the Compliance Officer and Information Technology Management must be contacted immediately. If Management declares an
incident or if there is a confirmed theft or loss of customer information, appropriate regulatory authorities, law enforcement, and legal
counsel are notified.

ITEM 6. [Reserved] 

ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

The Company is a Delaware-chartered
stock holding company whose most significant business activity is ownership of 100 of the common stock of Magyar Bank. Magyar Bank s
principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from
operations, principal repayments on loans and securities and borrowed funds, into one-to four-family residential mortgage loans, multi-family
and commercial real estate mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, commercial business loans and construction loans. Our
results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest we earn on our interest-earning
assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest income is primarily affected by the market interest
rate environment, the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, the timing of the placement of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities, and the prepayment rate on our mortgage-related assets. Other factors that may affect our results of operations are general
and local economic and competitive conditions, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 

During the year ended September
30, 2024, the Company s total assets grew 44.6 million, or 4.9 , to 951.9 million compared with 907.3 million at September 30,
2023. The increase was attributable to an 82.8 million increase in net loans receivable, a 5.3 million increase in bank-owned life insurance,
and a 3.4 million increase in other real estate owned. Offsetting these increases was a 46.9 million decrease in interest-earning deposits
with banks. 

Total deposits increased 41.2
million, or 5.5 , to 796.7 million and stockholders equity increased 5.8 million, or 5.5 , to 110.5 million during the year
ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company s net income
increased 74 thousand, or 1.0 , to 7.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2024 compared with net income of 7.7 million for
the year ended September 30, 2023 from higher net interest income, lower provision for credit losses and higher other income, partially
offset by higher income tax and other expenses. 

Throughout fiscal 2025, we
expect to continue increasing our commercial real estate and commercial business loans while managing non-interest expenses in an effort
to increase profitability of the Company. 

Our business operations are
subject to risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our operating results. The extent of such impact will depend on future
developments, which are highly uncertain. There continues to be various other risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company s
businesses and future results, such as changes to the U.S. economic condition, market interest rates, the Federal Reserve Board's monetary
policy, other government policies, and actions of regulatory agencies. 

Comparison of Financial Condition
at September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Total Assets. Total
assets increased 44.6 million, or 4.9 , to 951.9 million during the year ended September 30, 2024 compared with 907.3 million at September
30, 2023. The increase was attributable to higher loans receivable, bank-owned life insurance and other real estate owned. Partially offsetting
these increases were lower interest-earning deposits with banks, as we used cash and cash equivalents to fund loan growth. 

Loans Receivable. Total
loans receivable increased 83.0 million, or 11.9 , to 781.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 698.2 million at September 30, 2023.
The growth occurred in commercial real estate loans, which increased 72.2 million, or 18.6 , to 461.3 million, in one-to four-family
residential mortgage loans (including home equity lines of credit), which increased 16.3 million, or 6.4 , to 270.9 million, and in
construction and land loans, which increased 869 thousand, or 4.0 , to 22.7 million. Offsetting these increases were declines in commercial
business loans, which decreased 6.2 million, or 20.5 , to 24.0 million and in other consumer loans, which decreased 124 thousand, or
5.3 , to 2.2 million. 

Given the significance of
commercial real estate CRE loans to our total loan portfolio, the following table further disaggregates these loans by
occupied status and by collateral type as of September 30, 2024:

The Company obtains an appraisal
of the real estate collateral securing a CRE loan prior to originating the loan. The appraised value is used to calculate the ratio of
the outstanding loan balance to the value of the real estate collateral, or loan-to-value ratio ("LTV"). The original appraisal
is used to monitor the LTVs within the CRE portfolio unless an updated appraisal is received, which may happen for a variety of reasons
including, but not limited to, payment delinquency, additional loan requests using the same collateral, and loan modifications. The following
table presents the ranges in the LTVs of our CRE loans at September 30, 2024:

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023,
non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans (as defined by regulatory guidance) to total risk-based capital were estimated at approximately
270 and 262 , respectively. Management believes that Magyar Bank has implemented appropriate risk management practices, including risk
assessments, board-approved underwriting policies and related procedures, which include monitoring loan portfolio performance and stressing
of the commercial real estate portfolio under adverse economic conditions. 

Our asset quality with respect
to commercial real estate loans has remained strong despite recent economic and market conditions. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023,
we had 116 thousand and 2.2 million of non-performing commercial real estate loans, respectively. Such amounts totaled 0.03 and 0.60 
of total commercial real estate loans as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

In 2024, the Company adopted
ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , and subsequent related updates, using the modified retrospective approach for
all financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, and unfunded commitments. On October
1, 2023, the Company recorded a cumulative effect increase to retained earnings of 354 thousand, net of tax, which consisted of a 743
thousand reduction related to loans, and a 389 thousand increase related to unfunded commitments. There were no such charges for investment
securities held by the Company at the date of adoption. 

Investment Securities. 
Investment securities decreased 528 thousand, or 0.6 , to 95.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 96.0 million at September 30, 2023. 

Securities available-for-sale
increased 5.5 million, or 54.2 , to 15.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 10.1 million at September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable
to purchases totaling 6.0 million, unrealized gain of 834 thousand partially offset by principal repayments totaling 1.3 million. 

Securities held-to-maturity
decreased 6.0 million, or 7.0 , to 79.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 85.8 million at September 30, 2023. The decrease was the
attributable to principal repayments totaling 12.5 million and partially offset by purchases totaling 6.5 million. 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance. 
The cash surrender value of life insurance held for directors and executive officers of Magyar Bank increased 5.3 million, or 29.5 ,
to 23.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 18.0 million at September 30, 2023. 

In addition to a 433 thousand
increase in the cash surrender value of policies, the Company purchased new life insurance policies on directors and executive officers
of the Bank totaling 6.6 million and redeemed policies totaling 1.7 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. The Company
was in the process of restructuring 7.9 million of its BOLI portfolio at September 30, 2024 that is expected to increase the crediting
rate on the restructured BOLI policies from 2.24 (3.20 tax-equivalent yield) to 4.93 (7.04 tax-equivalent yield). The surrender of
BOLI policies also impacted income tax expense during the year ended September 30, 2024 as discussed below. 

Other Real Estate Owned.
 Other real estate owned increased 3.4 million to 3.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2024. The Company acquired four
properties totaling 4.4 million and sold two properties totaling 1.0 million during the year ended September 30, 2024. Of the three
remaining properties owned at September 30, 2024, two totaling 3.3 million were under contract of sale. 

Deposits. Total
deposits increased 41.2 million, or 5.5 , during the year ended September 30, 2024. The growth in deposits occurred in certificates of
deposit (including individual retirement accounts) which increased 55.0 million, or 52.5 , to 159.7 million, in interest-bearing checking
account balances, which increased 31.6 million, or 27.4 to 146.7 million, and in money market account balances, which increased 19.7
million, or 6.9 , to 304.6 million. Offsetting these increases were declines in non-interest checking account balances, which decreased
 55.7 million, or 29.6 , to 132.8 million and in savings account balances, which decreased 9.3 million, or 15.0 , to 52.9 million.
Customers sought higher-yielding deposit products during a period of increased interest rates. 

Included in the Company s
deposits were 249.9 million in municipal deposits at September 30, 2024, which represented 29.1 of total deposits. Under current State
of New Jersey legislation, municipal deposits exceeding 70 of the Bank s capital must be collateralized. Magyar Bank was in compliance
with the State s requirements at September 30, 2024. 

The Company s deposit
strategy in 2024 focused on retaining deposits and managing the overall cost of its interest-bearing liabilities during a period with
an inverted yield curve. In addition, the Company opened its eighth retail branch office in Martinsville, New Jersey in October 2024. 

Borrowed Funds. Borrowings
decreased 947 thousand, or 3.2 , to 28.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared with 29.5 million at September 30, 2023. 

Stockholders 
Equity. Stockholders equity increased 5.7 million, or 5.5 , to 110.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 104.8 million
at September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to the Company s net income from operations totaling 7.8 million, partially
offset by 1.7 million in dividends paid and 2.4 million in share repurchases. In addition, other comprehensive income, stock-based compensation
expense and the effect of adopting ASU 2016-13 increased the 

23 

Company s equity by 2.1 million. The Company s book value per
share increased to 16.98 at September 30, 2024 from 15.70 at September 30, 2023. 

Comparison of Operating Results
for the Years Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Net Income. The
Company s net income increased 74 thousand, or 1.0 , to 7.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2024 compared with 7.7
million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from higher net interest income, lower provision for credit losses and higher other income,
partially offset by higher income tax and other expenses. Earnings per share increased to 1.23 for the year ended September 30, 2024
from 1.20 for the year ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Interest and Dividend
Income. Net interest and dividend income increased 240 thousand, or 0.9 , to 28.0 million during the year ended September 30,
2024 compared to 27.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. 

The Company s net interest
margin decreased 36 basis points to 3.14 for the year ended September 30, 2024 from 3.50 for the year ended September 30, 2023. Growth
in the Company s average interest-earning assets more than offset margin compression between periods due to market interest rate
levels and the prolonged inversion to the yield curve. 

Average Balance Sheet.
 The following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for the years ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023. The table presents the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing
liabilities. We derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. We derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest
income includes fees that we consider adjustments to yields. Interest income on loans includes loan fees, but such amounts were not material
for the years ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

Rate/Volume Analysis. 
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column
shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by average volume). The volume column shows the effects
attributable to changes in volume (changes in average volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior
columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately,
based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period adjustments excluded from the table below

Interest and Dividend
Income. Interest and dividend income increased 10.5 million, or 27.6 , to 48.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2024
from 38.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of interest-earnings assets between the two periods increased
 99.4 million, or 12.6 , to 890.8 million from 791.4 million, while the yield on such assets increased 64 basis point to 5.45 for the
year ended September 30, 2024 from 4.81 for the year ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest income on loans increased
 7.9 million, or 22.4 , to 43.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2024 from 35.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2023,
while the average balance of loans increased 65.5 million, or 9.8 , to 734.4 million from 668.9 million. The average yield on such
loans increased 60 basis points to 5.87 at September 30, 2024 from 5.27 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from higher market interest
rates. 

Interest earned on investment
securities, including interest earned on deposits but excluding FHLBNY stock, increased 2.5 million, or 94.3 , to 5.2 million for the
year ended September 30, 2024 from 2.7 million for the year ended 

26 

2023. The increase was attributable to a 116 basis point increase in
the average yield on investment securities and interest earned on deposits to 3.41 from 2.25 , and 33.6 million increase in the average
balance of investment securities and interest earning deposits to 154.1 million from 120.5 million during the year ended September 30,
2023. 

Interest Expense. Interest
expense increased 10.3 million, or 99.3 , to 20.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2024 from 10.3 million for the year ended
September 30, 2023. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased 130.7 million, or 24.8 , to 657.9 million from 527.3
million between the two periods while the average cost on such interest-bearing liabilities increased 117 basis points to 3.13 for the
year ended September 30, 2024 from 1.96 for the year ended September 30, 2023. Higher market interest rates were primarily responsible
for the increase in the cost of the Company s interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended September 30, 2024. 

The average balance of interest-bearing
deposits increased 127.4 million, or 25.4 , to 629.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2024 from 501.7 million for the year
ended September 30, 2023 while the average cost on such interest-bearing deposits increased 125 basis points to 3.14 from 1.89 . Average
expense on interest-bearing deposits increased 10.2 million, or 107.9 , to 19.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared with 9.5 million
at September 30, 2023. 

Interest expense on advances
increased 26 thousand, or 3.1 , to 872 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2024 from 846 thousand for the year ended September
30, 2023. The average cost of borrowings decreased 29 basis points to 3.02 for the year ended September 30, 2024 from 3.31 for the year
ended September 30, 2023 while the average balance of those borrowings increased 3.3 million to 28.9 million for the year ended September
30, 2024 from 25.6 million the prior year. 

Provision for Credit
Losses. The provision for credit losses decreased 291 thousand, or 76.4 , to 90 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2024
compared to 381 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2023. During the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 69 thousand
in net loan recoveries compared with 484 thousand in net charge-offs for the year ended September 30, 2023. In addition to lower net
charge-offs, the provision for credit losses on loans decreased in amount and as a percentage of gross loans during the year from higher
balances of lower risk loans and lower balances of higher risk loans in addition to lower adjustments to the historical loss for all loan
categories for improving economic conditions. 

Other Income. Other
income increased 931 thousand, or 34.7 , to 3.6 million during the year ended September 30, 2024 compared with 2.7 million the year
ended September 30, 2023. The Company s gains on other real estate, SBA loans and premises were 1.3 million, 599 thousand and
 60 thousand, respectively, during the year ended September 30, 2024 compared with 0, 565 thousand and 9 thousand, respectively, during
the year ended September 30, 2023. In addition, service charges decreased 457 thousand to 1.1 million during the year ended September
30, 2024 compared with 1.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from lower commercial loan prepayment fees. 

Other Expenses. Other
expenses increased 1.1 million, or 5.7 , to 20.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.3 million for the
year ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher compensation benefit expenses, which increased 689 thousand, or 6.2 , to 11.8
million for the year ended September 30, 2024 from 11.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to fewer
open positions between the two years and the additions of a commercial lender and a commercial credit analyst, as well as annual merit
increases. 

Other expenses increased 202
thousand, or 9.4 , from higher recruitment costs, loan origination and servicing costs and operating expenses. In addition, deposit insurance
premiums increased 81 thousand, or 23.8 , to 421 thousand from deposit growth and higher insurance assessment rates implemented by the
FDIC for all insured institutions effective January 1, 2023. 

Income Tax Expense. 
Income tax expense increased 285 thousand, or 9.4 , to 3.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2024 from 3.0 million for the year
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to higher pre-tax income and a 456 thousand expense for taxable gains on surrendered
bank-owned life insurance policies during the year ended September 30, 2024. The Company s effective income tax rate was 29.9 for
the year ended September 30, 2024 and 28.2 for the year ended September 30, 2023. 

Management of Market Risk 

General . The
majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate
risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage loans, have longer maturities than our 

27 

liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits.
As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income
to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has established an Asset and Liability Management Committee which
is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is
appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this
risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on
a regular basis and the Asset and Liability Committee meets at least on a quarterly basis to review our asset/liability policies and interest
rate risk position. 

We have sought to manage our
interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. As part of our ongoing
asset-liability management, we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by originating and retaining adjustable-rate loans in
the residential, construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios, by using alternative funding sources, such as advances from
the FHLBNY, to match fund longer-term residential and commercial mortgage loans, and by originating and retaining variable-rate
home equity and short-term and medium-term fixed-rate commercial business loans. We also offer a commercial loan swap product that allows
the Bank to receive floating-rate interest loan payments while its borrowers pay a fixed rate of interest on their loans. We have also
increased money market account deposits as a percentage of our total deposits. Money market accounts offer a variable rate based on market
indications. By following these strategies, we believe that we are well-positioned to react to changes in market interest rates. 

Net Interest Income
Analysis. The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the estimated changes in our Net Interest Income NII for each of the next two years that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in interest rates. These estimates require
making certain assumptions including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities
and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, we cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest
rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes
and changes in market conditions. Further, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the interest rate risk measurement.
Modeling changes in net interest income require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields
and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is the ability to
meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments,
FHLBNY borrowings and maturities and sales of investment securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities
are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions
and competition. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies
in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies.
We seek to maintain a liquidity ratio of 5.0 of assets or greater. The liquidity ratio is calculated by determining the sum of the difference
between liquid assets (cash and unpledged investment securities) and short-term liabilities (estimated 30-day deposit outflows), plus
our borrowing capacity from the FHLBNY and dividing the sum by total assets. At September 30, 2024, our liquidity ratio was 7.6 of assets. 

We regularly adjust our investments
in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand, expected deposit flows, yields available on interest-earning deposits
and securities, and the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning
deposits and short-and intermediate-term securities. 

Our most liquid assets are
cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during
any given period. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 

28 

25.6 million compared with 72.5 million at September 30,
2023. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity from sales, totaled 15.6 million at
September 30, 2024 compared with 10.1 million at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we also had the ability to borrow 272.3 million
from the FHLBNY compared with 230.1 million at September 30 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 28.6 million in advances
outstanding and 120.0 million in municipal letters of credit outstanding with the FHLBNY leaving 164.9 million as our remaining borrowing
capacity. Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows included in our consolidated Financial Statements. 

At September 30, 2024, we
had 28.6 million in loan origination commitments outstanding. In addition to commitments to originate loans, we had 88.3 million in
unused lines of credit to borrowers. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled 99.2 million, or 12.45 
of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits
and FHLBNY advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than
we currently pay on the certificates of deposit (including individual retirement accounts and brokered certificate deposit accounts) due
on or before September 30, 2025. We believe, however, that based on past experience a significant portion of our certificates of deposit
(including individual retirement accounts and brokered certificate deposit accounts) will remain with us. We have the ability to attract
and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. 

Our primary investing activities
are the origination of loans and the purchase of investment securities. We originated 161.1 million in loans and purchased 12.5 million
of investment securities during the year ended September 30, 2024. Comparatively, we originated 188.5 million in loans and purchased
 6.6 million of investment securities during the year ended September 30, 2023. 

Financing activities consist
primarily of activity in deposit accounts and FHLBNY advances. We experienced a net increase in total deposits of 41.2 million, or 5.46 ,
to 796.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared with a net increase in total deposits of 87.7 million, or 13.1 , to
 755.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest
rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors. 

Liquidity management is both
a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements
exist with the FHLBNY, which provide an additional source of funds. FHLBNY advances totaled 28.6 million and 29.5 million at September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. FHLBNY advances have primarily been used to fund loan demand. 

In addition to borrowings,
the Bank has the ability to raise deposits on the brokered market or through deposit listing services. At September 30, 2024, the Bank
held 29.6 million in brokered deposits and 20.0 million from deposit listing services. 

Magyar Bank is subject to
various regulatory capital requirements, (see Supervision and Regulation-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements ).
As of September 30, 2024, Magyar Bank s Tier 1 capital as a percentage of the Bank s average assets was 11.11 and the total
qualifying capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets was 15.85 . 

Bank-owned life insurance
is a tax-advantaged financing transaction that is used to offset employee benefit plan costs. Policies are purchased insuring directors
and officers of Magyar Bank using a single premium method of payment. Magyar Bank is the owner and beneficiary of the policies and records
tax-free income through cash surrender value accumulation. We have minimized our credit exposure by choosing carriers that are highly
rated and limiting the concentration of any one carrier. The investment in bank-owned life insurance has no significant impact on our
capital and liquidity. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 

Commitments. 
As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments
to extend credit, standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash
requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject
to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by us. For additional information, see Note O, Commitments, 
and Note P Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk to our consolidated financial statements. 

29 

Contractual Obligations. 
In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include operating leases for
premises and equipment. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company s accounting
policies are more fully described in Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
As disclosed in Note B, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The Company believes that the following discussion
addresses the Company s most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company s
financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. 

Allowance for Credit Losses.

The allowance for credit
losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover expected credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet
date. The allowance is established through the provision for credit losses which is charged against income. In determining the
allowance for credit losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical. Due
to the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic
environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for credit losses, the methodology for determining
the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management. 

As a substantial amount of
our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash
flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans. Assumptions for appraisals
and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties. Overly optimistic assumptions or negative
changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined. The
assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the
resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans. 

Management performs a quarterly
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. We consider a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including,
but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying
collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently
subjective as it requires material estimates by management that may be susceptible to significant change based on changes in economic
and real estate market conditions. 

The evaluation has a specific
and general component. The specific component relates to loans that are delinquent or otherwise identified as impaired through the application
of our loan review process and our loan grading system. All such loans are evaluated individually, with principal consideration given
to the value of the collateral securing the loan and discounted cash flows. Specific impairment allowances are established as required
by this analysis. However, the Bank s Federal and State regulators generally require that the specific reserve against impaired
collateral-dependent loans be charged-off, reducing the carrying balance of the loan and allowance for loan loss. The general component
is determined by segregating the remaining loans into homogenous categories. We analyze the historical loss experience of each category,
delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations in establishing the general portion of the
reserve. This analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general component of the
allowance for credit losses. 

The process of determining
the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates,
additional provision for credit and lease losses may be required that would reduce future earnings.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and the Board
of Directors of Magyar Bancorp, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Magyar Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiary (the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023; the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then
ended; and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note B to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective October 1, 2023, due to the adoption of
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses . 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent, with respect to the Company, in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated
below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements; and (2) involve
our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter, in any way,
our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing
separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

32 

Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)
 Qualitative Adjustments 

Description of the Matter 

The Company s loan portfolio
totaled 780.2 million as of September 30, 2024, and the associated ACL was 7.5 million. As discussed in Notes B and E to the consolidated
financial statements, determining the amount of the ACL requires significant judgment about the expected future losses. The ACL calculation
is based on an average charge-off model, to identify a baseline expected loss reserve, which is then adjusted for certain qualitative
conditions. Management applies these qualitative adjustments to the baseline reserve, to reflect changes in the environment, both internal
and external, that are different from the conditions that existed during the historical loss calculation period. 

We identified these qualitative
adjustments within the ACL as a critical audit matter because they involve a high degree of subjectivity. While the determination of these
qualitative adjustments includes analysis of observable data over the historical loss period, the judgments required to assess the directionality
and magnitude of adjustments are highly subjective. 

How we addressed the matter in our
audit 

The primary procedures we performed
to address this critical audit matter included: 

Testing the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the calculation
of the allowance for credit losses, including the accuracy of inputs into significant factor adjustments. 

Testing the completeness and accuracy of the significant data points that management uses in their evaluation
of significant qualitative adjustments. 

Testing the accuracy of other significant inputs into the calculation including loan balances, historical
charge-off and recovery data, and expected loan terms. 

Evaluating the directional consistency and magnitude of management s conclusions regarding basis
points applied (whether positive or negative), based on the trends identified in the underlying data. 

Testing the clerical accuracy of the application of the qualitative adjustments to the loan segments within
the ACL calculation. 

We have served as the Company s
auditor since 2023.

purchases shares of common stock in the open market using proceeds of a loan from the Company. The loan bears a fixed interest rate of
 with principal and interest payable annually in equal installments over years and is secured by shares of the Company s
stock. The Bank makes cash contributions to the ESOP on an annual basis sufficient to enable the ESOP to make the required loan payments
to the Company. As the debt is repaid, shares are released as collateral and allocated to qualified employees. Accordingly, the shares
pledged as collateral are reported as unearned ESOP shares in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company accounts for its ESOP in accordance
with FASB ASC Topic 718, Employer s Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans . As shares are released from
collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the current market price of the shares, and the shares become outstanding
for earnings per share computations.

The investment securities
listed above currently have fair values less than amortized cost and therefore contain unrealized losses. The Company evaluated these
securities and determined that the decline in value was primarily related to fluctuations in the interest rate environment and were not
related to any company or industry specific event. 

The
Company anticipates full recovery of amortized costs with respect to these securities. The Company does not intend to sell these securities
and has determined that it is not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell these securities prior to maturity or
market price recovery. For individual debt securities classified as available-for-sale, we determine whether a decline in fair value below
the amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. If the decline in fair value is due to credit, we will record the
portion of the impairment loss relating to credit through an allowance for credit losses. Impairment that has not been recorded through
an allowance for credit losses is recorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.

million at September 30, 2024
and million at September 30, 2023. There were thousand and million in new loans or advances on existing lines of credit
during the year ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total principal repayments and/or reductions due to retirements were
approximately million and thousand for the year ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

At September 30, 2024
and 2023, the Company was servicing loans for others amounting to approximately million and million, respectively. The Company
held mortgage servicing rights in the amount of thousand and thousand at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Servicing
loans for others generally consists of collecting mortgage payments, maintaining escrow accounts, disbursing payments to investors, and
foreclosure processing. Loan servicing income is recorded on the cash basis and includes servicing fees from investors and certain charges
collected from borrowers, such as late payment fees. In connection with loans serviced for others, the Company held borrowers escrow
balances of approximately thousand and thousand at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The segments of the
Company s loan portfolio are disaggregated to a level that allows management to monitor risk and performance. The residential mortgage
loan segment is further disaggregated into two classes: first lien, amortizing term loans, and the combination of second lien amortizing
term loans and home equity lines of credit. The commercial loan segment is further disaggregated into three classes: loans secured by
multifamily structures, loans secured by owner-occupied commercial structures, and loans secured by non-owner occupied nonresidential
properties. The construction loan segment consists primarily of developers or investors for the purpose of acquiring, developing and constructing
residential or commercial structures and to a lesser extent one-to-four family residential construction loans made to individuals for
the acquisition of and/or construction on a lot or lots on which a residential dwelling is to be built. Construction loans to developers
and investors have a higher risk profile because the ultimate buyer, once development is completed, is generally not known at the time
of the loan. The commercial business loan segment consists of loans made for the purpose of financing the activities of commercial customers
and consists of revolving lines of credit and loans partially guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The consumer loan
segment consists primarily of stock-secured installment loans, but also includes unsecured personal loans and overdraft lines of credit
connected with customer deposit accounts. 

Management uses a ten
point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first six categories are considered
not criticized, and are aggregated as Pass rated. The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow
bank regulatory definitions. The Special Mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are potentially weak, resulting
in an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a Substandard classification. Loans in the Substandard
category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and have a distinct possibility that some loss will
be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. Loans classified Doubtful have all the weaknesses
inherent in loans classified Substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current
conditions and facts, is highly improbable. All loans greater than three months past due are considered Substandard. Any portion
of a loan that has been charged off is placed in the Loss category. 

To help ensure that
risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Company has a structured
loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans
are included in the Pass categories unless a specific action, such as severe delinquency, bankruptcy, repossession, or death occurs to
raise awareness of a possible credit event. The Company s Commercial Loan Officers are responsible for the timely and accurate
risk rating of the loans in their portfolios at origination and on an ongoing basis. The Company s Asset Review Committee performs
monthly reviews of all commercial relationships internally rated 6 Watch or worse. Confirmation of the appropriate
risk grade is performed by an external loan review company that semi-annually reviews and assesses loans within the portfolio. Detailed reviews, including plans for resolution, are performed on loans classified as Substandard on a monthly basis.

are removed from the balance sheet, mortgage servicing rights are recorded as an asset for servicing rights retained, and a gain on sale,
if applicable, is recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and the sales proceeds, net of origination
costs. 

Gains on sales of loans,
representing the difference between the total sales price received for the loans and the allocated cost of the loans, are recognized when
loans are sold and delivered to the purchasers. Loans are accounted for as sold when control of the loan is surrendered. Control
over the loans is deemed surrendered when (a) the loans have been isolated from the Company; (b) the buyer has the right (free of conditions
that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the loans; and (c) the Company does not maintain effective
control over the loans through either (a) an agreement that entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase or redeem the loans before
maturity, or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the buyer to return specific loans. 

The Company services

In assessing the realizability
of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which temporary differences are deductible and carry forwards are available. 

There were no valuation
allowances for the year ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company has considered future market growth, forecasted earnings, future
taxable income, feasible and permissible tax planning strategies in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets. If the Company
was to determine that it would not be able to realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently
no valuation allowance, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was
made. 

The Bank s statutory
income tax rate in the State of New Jersey was for the years ending September 30, 2024 and 2023. The State of New Jersey has imposed

tax year ended September 30, 2024. The surtax is set at a rate of and it currently effective through 2029. Accordingly, the Company
used an State tax rate for the calculation of its State income tax expense for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The following is a
description of valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 

Impaired Loans 

Loans which meet certain
criteria are evaluated individually for impairment. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that
the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All amounts due according
to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest and principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the
loan agreement. Three impairment measurement methods are used, depending upon the collateral securing the asset: 1) the present value
of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate; 2) the asset s observable market price; or
3) the fair value of the collateral if the asset is collateral dependent. The regulatory agencies require this method for loans from which
repayment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. The Company s impaired loans are generally collateral
dependent and, as such, are carried at the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated selling and disposition costs. Fair value
is estimated through current appraisals, and adjusted as necessary, by management, to reflect current market conditions and, as such,
are generally classified as Level 3. There were no such loans at September 30, 2024.

presents the carrying amount, fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company s financial instruments
carried at cost or amortized cost as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. This table excludes financial instruments for which the
carrying amount approximates fair value, which includes cash and cash equivalents, FHLBNY stock, bank owned life insurance, accrued
interest receivable, interest and non-interest bearing demand, savings deposits, and accrued interest payable. For short-term
financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the relatively
short time between the origination of the instrument and its expected realization. For financial liabilities such as
interest-bearing demand, NOW, and money market savings deposits, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to
these products having no stated maturity.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures

Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change in
Magyar Bancorp, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting during Magyar Bancorp, Inc.'s fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Magyar Bancorp, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting. 

Report by Management on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

The management of Magyar Bancorp,
Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Magyar Bancorp Inc.'s internal
control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Magyar Bancorp, Inc.'s management and board of directors regarding
the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 

All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

Magyar Bancorp, Inc.'s management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment,
it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 2013 in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company's internal control over financial reporting
was effective based on those criteria. 

The Annual Report on Form
10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to exemption
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report.

MAGYAR BANCORP, INC. 

 POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REGARDING INSIDER
TRADING AND 
THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION 

I. Executive Summary 

This policy provides guidelines
to employees, executive officers and directors Magyar Bancorp and its subsidiaries, including Magyar Bank (the Company with respect to transactions in the Company s publicly traded securities, including common stock, options for common stock and any
other securities the Company may issue from time to time, such as preferred stock, warrants and convertible debentures. In this policy,
the employees, executive officers and directors of the Company are referred to as Insiders. There is a presumption
that the restrictions applicable to Insiders apply equally to their spouse, minor children and family members sharing the same
home. 

Any person who possesses Material
Nonpublic Information regarding the Company is deemed to be an Insider for so long as the information is not publicly known or disclosed. 

II. Material Nonpublic Information 

It is not possible to define all
categories of material information. However, information should be regarded as material if there is a reasonable likelihood that it would
be considered important to an investor in making an investment decision regarding the purchase or sale of the Company s securities. 

While
it may be difficult under this standard to determine whether particular information is material, there are various categories of information
that are particularly sensitive and, as a general rule, should always be considered material. 

 Either
positive or negative information may be material. Examples of such information may include but are not limited to: 

Financial
results 

Projections of future earnings or losses 

News of a pending or proposed merger or acquisition 

News of the disposition of a subsidiary 

Impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems 

Gain or loss of a substantial customer or supplier 

Changes in dividend or stock repurchase policies 

Stock splits 

New equity or debt offerings 

Significant litigation exposure due to actual
or threatened litigation 

Major changes in senior management 

1 

Nonpublic information is information
that has not been previously disclosed to the general public and is otherwise not readily available to the general public. 

III. General Policy 

It is the policy of the Company
to prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company acquired in the workplace or otherwise
and to prohibit the misuse of Material Nonpublic Information in securities trading. Remember, anyone scrutinizing your transactions will
be doing so after the fact, with the benefit of hindsight. As a practical matter, before engaging in any transaction, you should carefully
consider how enforcement authorities and others might view the transaction in hindsight. 

IV. Specific Polices 

1. Trading
on Material Nonpublic Information. No Insider shall engage in any transaction involving a purchase or sale of the Company s
securities, including any offer to purchase or offer to sell, during any period commencing with the date that he or she possesses Material
Nonpublic Information concerning the Company, and ending at the close of business on the trading day following the date of public disclosure
of that information, or at such time as such nonpublic information is no longer material. As used herein, the term trading day 
shall mean a day on which national stock exchanges and the Nasdaq Stock Market are open for trading. 

2. Earnings
Releases and Black Out Period for Trading. As a precaution, the Company specifically prohibits Regulatory Insiders 
and a specifically identified group of employees from engaging in any transaction involving a purchase or sale of the Company s
securities during any period commencing at the end of the 15 th day of the third month of each calendar quarter, and ending
at the close of business on the second trading day following the date of public disclosure of financial information for that quarter/year
end (the black-out period ). 

The Company s directors and
its executive officers are considered Regulatory Insiders . The specifically identified group of employees will be determined by
the Chief Executive Officer, and will generally consist of those employees who have routine access to Material Non-public Information,
especially information regarding the financial condition and performance of the Company. It should be noted that just because an individual
is not subject to this black out period for trading, the prohibition on trading while in possession of Material Nonpublic
Information applies to everyone, within or within the black out period. 

3. Tipping.
 No Insider shall disclose tip Material Nonpublic Information to any other person, including family members or members
of an insider s household, where such information may be used by such person to his or her profit by trading in the securities of
companies to which such information relates, nor shall such Insider or related person make recommendations or express opinions on the
basis of Material Nonpublic Information as to trading in the Company s securities. 

2 

4. Confidentiality
of Nonpublic Information. Nonpublic information relating to the Company is the property of the Company and the unauthorized disclosure
of such information is forbidden. 

V. Potential Criminal and Civil Liability and/or Disciplinary Action 

1. Liability
for Insider Trading. Insiders may be subject to disgorgement of profits, or losses avoided, monetary penalties and/or time in jail
for engaging in transactions in the Company s securities at a time when the Insider has knowledge of Material Nonpublic Information
regarding the Company. 

2. Liability
for Tipping. Insiders may also be liable for improper transactions by any person, commonly referred to the tippee , to
whom they have disclosed Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company or to whom they have made recommendations or expressed opinions
on the basis of such information as to trading in the Company s securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC has imposed large penalties even when the disclosing person did not profit from the trading. The SEC, the stock exchanges and the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. use sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques to uncover insider-trading activities. 

3. Possible
Disciplinary Actions. Employees and directors of the Company who violate this Policy shall also be subject to disciplinary action
by the Company, which may include immediate termination of employment or service. 

VI. Applicability of Policy to Inside Information Regarding Other Companies 

This policy and the guidelines
described herein also apply to Material Nonpublic Information relating to other companies, including the Company s and the Bank s
customers, vendors, suppliers or acquisition candidates business partners when that information is obtained in the course
of employment with, or other services performed on behalf of, the Company. Civil and criminal penalties and termination of employment
may result from trading on inside information regarding the Company s business partners. All employees should treat Material Nonpublic
Information about the Company s business partners with the same care required with respect to information related directly to the
Company. 

VII. Certain Exceptions 

1. Stock
Option Exercises. The Company s insider trading policy does not apply to the exercise of an employee stock option, or to the
exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax
withholding requirements. The policy does apply, however, to any sale of stock following exercise, or as part of a broker-assisted
cashless exercise, of an option, or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an
option. 

3 

2. 401(k)
Plan. The Company s insider trading policy does not apply to ongoing purchases of Company stock in the 401(k) plan resulting
from your periodic contribution of money to the plan pursuant to your payroll deduction election. The policy does apply, however, to
elections you may make under the 401(k) plan, including (a) an election to commence or terminate purchases of Common Stock through
the 401(k) plan; (b) an election to increase or decrease the percentage of your periodic contributions that will be allocated to
the Company stock fund; (c) an election to make an intra-plan transfer of an existing account balance into or out of the Company
stock fund; (d) an election to borrow money against your 401(k) plan account if the loan will result in a liquidation of some or
all of your Company stock fund balance; and (e) your election to pre-pay a plan loan if the pre-payment will result in an allocation
of loan proceeds to the Company stock fund. 

 3. Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. The Company s insider trading policy does not apply to ongoing purchases of Company stock
under the Company s dividend reinvestment plan resulting from your reinvestment of dividends paid on Company securities and the
periodic contribution of money to the stock purchase plan pursuant to your bank account deduction election. The policy does apply,
however, to voluntary purchases of Company stock resulting from additional contributions you choose to make to the plan, and to your election
to participate in the plan or increase or decrease your level of participation in the plan. The policy also applies to your sale of
any Company stock purchased pursuant to the plan. 

 4. 10b5
Plans. The Company s insider trading policy does not apply to purchases or sales of Company stock under a pre-approved trading
plan that complies with Rule 10b5-1 of the SEC. The policy does apply, however, to the election by an individual or the Company to
enter into a 10b5 plan. 

 5. Charitable
Contributions. The Company does not believe that Regulatory Insiders should be prohibited from making bona fide gifts and charitable
donations outside the trading window in situations where there is no unusual activity or other reason to believe that a transaction would
be particularly risky. As with other transactions in the Company s securities, and as explained below, Regulatory Insiders 
 need to pre-clear these transactions. 

VIII. Additional Prohibited Transactions 

The Company considers it
improper and inappropriate for any director, executive officer or other employee of the Company to engage in short-term or speculative
transactions in the Company s securities. It therefore is the Company s policy that directors, executive officers and other
employees may not engage in any of the following transactions: 

4 

1. Short
Sales. Short sales of the Company s securities evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline
in value, and therefore signal to the market that the seller has no confidence in the Company or its short-term prospects. In addition,
short sales may reduce the seller s incentive to improve the Company s performance. For these reasons, short sales of the
Company s securities are prohibited by this policy. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Securities and Exchange Act prohibits
executive officers and directors from engaging in short sales. 

 2. Margin
Accounts and Pledges by Regulatory Insiders. Securities held in a margin account may be sold by the broker without the customer s
consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold
in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Because a margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is
aware of Material Nonpublic Information or is not permitted to trade in Company securities, directors and executive officers are discouraged
from pledging Company securities as collateral for margin purchases or a loan. If Company securities are pledged as collateral for margin
purchases or a loan by a Regulatory Insider , the Investor Relations Officer must be informed. The SEC has proposed that
the annual proxy statement disclose the number of shares pledged by directors and executive officers. 

 3. Post-Termination
Transactions. This Policy continues to apply to your transactions in Company securities even after you have terminated employment
with the Company. If you are in possession of Material Nonpublic Information when your employment terminates, you may not trade in Company
securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. 

IX. Additional Information Regulatory Insiders 

Regulatory Insiders of
the Company must also comply with the reporting obligations and limitations on short-swing transactions set forth in Section 16 of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. While such provisions are quite complex under the Act, the practical effect of these
provisions is that Regulatory Insiders who purchase and sell (or sell and purchase) the Company s securities within a six-month
period must forfeit, or disgorge, all profits to the Company whether or not they had knowledge of any Material Nonpublic Information.
Under these provisions, and so long as certain other criteria are met, neither the receipt of an option under the Company s option
plans, nor the exercise of that option nor the receipt of stock under the Company s employee stock purchase plan, if applicable,
is deemed a purchase under Section 16. However, the sale of any such shares relative to the above-mentioned programs is considered a sale
under Section 16. 

All Regulatory Insiders 
are required to file a Form 4 with the SEC within two business days of a transaction related to Company stock. The filing of these forms
is the responsibility of the respective Regulatory Insider but are coordinated and filed by the Company. 

5 

In an effort to maintain compliance
with the strict timeframes of Section 16 and the policies referenced herein, all trades by a Regulatory Insider and the specifically
identified group of employees must be pre-approved through the Investor Relations Officer prior to the execution of that trade.
Therefore, such persons must notify the Investor Relations Officer prior to engaging in a stock sale or purchase.

 CLAWBACK POLICY 

The Board of Directors (the Board of Magyar Bancorp, Inc. (the Company believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to adopt
this Clawback Policy (this Policy ), which provides for the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in the event the
Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 

The Company has adopted this Policy
as a supplement to any other clawback policies or provisions in effect now or in the future at the Company. To the extent this Policy
applies to compensation payable to a person covered by this Policy, it shall supersede any other conflicting provision or policy maintained
by the Company and shall be the only clawback policy applicable to such compensation and no other clawback policy shall apply; provided
that, if such other policy or provision provides that a greater amount of such compensation shall be subject to clawback, such other policy
or provision shall apply to the amount in excess of the amount subject to clawback under this Policy. 

This Policy shall be interpreted
to comply with the clawback rules found in 17 C.F.R. 240.10D-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act and the related listing rules of the national securities exchange or national securities association
(the Exchange on which the Company has listed securities, and, to the extent this Policy is in any manner deemed inconsistent
with such rules, this Policy shall be treated as retroactively amended to be compliant with such rules. 

1. Definitions . 

(a) Accounting Restatement means an accounting restatement due to the
material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting
restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements,

regard to any taxes paid. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously
Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement: (1) the
amount shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return
upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received; and (2) the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that
reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Exchange. The Board shall determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and
method for promptly recouping Erroneously Awarded Compensation hereunder, which may include without limitation (a) seeking reimbursement

or unpaid, (c) cancelling or offsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards, (d) forfeiture of deferred compensation,
subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder and (e) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. Subject to compliance with any applicable law,

Exceptions. The Company shall recover reasonably promptly any Erroneously Awarded Compensation except to the extent that the conditions
of paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) below apply. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee shall determine
the repayment schedule for each amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in a manner that complies with this reasonably promptly 
requirement. Such determination shall be consistent with any applicable legal guidance by the Securities and Exchange Commission, judicial
opinion, or otherwise. The determination of reasonably promptly may vary from case to case and the Committee is authorized
to adopt additional rules to further describe what repayment schedules satisfy this requirement. 

(a) Erroneously Awarded Compensation need not be recovered if the direct expense paid to a third party to
assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered and the Committee has made a determination that recovery would
be impracticable. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on
expense of enforcement, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable
attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the Exchange, as required. 

(b) If applicable, Erroneously Awarded Compensation need not be recovered if recovery would violate home country
law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously
Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the 

3 

Company shall obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to
the Exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation and shall provide such opinion to the Exchange. 

(c) Erroneously Awarded Compensation need not be recovered if recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified
retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13)
or Section 411(a) of the Code and regulations thereunder. 

6. Committee
Decisions. Decisions of the Committee with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all Executive Officers
subject to this Policy, unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be an abuse of discretion. Any members of the Committee,
and any other members of the Board who assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action, determination
or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable
law and Company policy with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other
rights to indemnification of the members of the Board under applicable law or Company policy.

Indemnification . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other policy of the Company, the governing documents of the Company
or any agreement between the Company and an Executive Officer, no Executive Officer shall be indemnified by the Company against the loss
of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation. Further, the Company is prohibited from paying or reimbursing an Executive Officer for purchasing
insurance to cover any such loss.
