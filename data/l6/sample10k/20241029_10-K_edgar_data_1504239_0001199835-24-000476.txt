Forward
Looking Statements 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, expect, plan, 
 anticipate, believe , estimate, predict, potential or continue 
or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled Risk Factors included herein that may cause
our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future
results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Important factors
that may cause actual results to differ from projections include, for example: 

the
 success or failure of management s efforts to implement our plan of operation; 

the
 success or failure of management s efforts to build its EZ Saliva business; 

the
 ability of the Company to fund its operating expenses; 

the
 ability of the Company to compete with other companies that have a similar plan of operation; 

the
 effect of changing economic conditions impacting our plan of operation; 

the
 ability of the Company to meet the other risks as may be described in future filings with the SEC. 

While
these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment
regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions,
projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities
laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
The safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 does not apply to this
annual report. 

Unless
otherwise noted, all references in this Form 10-K to Point of Care Nano-Technology, PCNT, the Company,

1. Business 

Overview 

On
April 11, 2022, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Duo Sciences Inc. DSI ), acquired an exclusive license to distribute
certain intellectual property in animal nutrition and animal supplements from Cedoga Consulting, LLC, and on April 19, 2022, we, through
DSI, signed an exclusive sales and promotion agreement with Lucy Pet Products Inc. Lucy pursuant to which Lucy will manufacture,
market and distribute on our behalf pet products created from the Cedoga intellectual property. Except for an initial agreement fee of
 100,000 we have not yet generated any other income from this product line. 

As
further discussed below, on May 20, 2024, we acquired the EZ Saliva testing business. Our plan of operation for the next
12 months is to build our EZ Saliva business (described below) through traditional direct sales and marketing efforts to police departments
and lab test companies in North America. There can be no assurances that we will be successful with our EZ Saliva business or any other
business initiative we may undertake. 

Recent
Activities 

On
May 30, 2024, we engaged and executed an agreement with Fruci Associates II Fruci ), PLLC as our new independent accountant
for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022. 

On
May 20, 2024, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Agreement with Point of Care Nano-Technology, LLC Point ).
Point was the company (unrelated to us) that Dr. Raouf Guirguis established to operate the business that Dr. Guirguis took back as a
result of the consummation of the Spin Off Agreements (discussed below). Pursuant to this Agreement we agreed to acquire (the Acquisition substantially all of the North American assets of Point (the Assets ), consisting primarily of proprietary information and
know-how for the developing and commercialization of kits for drug testing and to diagnose illnesses through the testing of human saliva,
referred to as the EZ Saliva test kits, and cash in the amount of 101,400. 

In
exchange for the Assets, we issued to Point and/or its designees 66,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock (the Consideration
Shares ). 

Upon
the closing of the Acquisition, which effected a change of control of the Company, Dr. Raouf Guirguis, the controlling member of Point,
became a director of the Company and Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. Guirguis also acquired, directly and indirectly, 34,596,800 of the
Consideration Shares, or approximately 48.4 of the shares of our common stock outstanding after completion of the Acquisition. Mr. Nathan
Keele, an associate of Dr. Guirguis and responsible for marketing efforts at Point, also was appointed to the board of directors of the
Company. Mr. Keele will continue his marketing efforts at the Company. Mr. Keele acquired 18,903,200 of the Consideration Shares, or
approximately 26.5 of the shares of our common stock outstanding after completion of the Acquisition. 

Nicholas
DeVito, our controlling stockholder prior to the Acquisition through the 1,000 shares of our super-majority class A preferred stock (the
 Preferred Stock that he held and through which he exercised eighty percent (80 voting control over the Company, surrendered
to us for cancellation the Preferred Stock and received, in exchange, 5,000,000 shares of our common stock. Mr. DeVito will retain his
positions as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary as well as his status as a member of our board
of directors. 

The
shares of Company common stock issued in connection with the Acquisition (as described above) were issued in accordance with a private
placement exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and are considered restricted
securities. 

4 

In
connection with the Acquisition, we entered into a license agreement (the License Agreement with Zeus Diagnostics, LLC Zeus ),
a Delaware limited liability company controlled by Dr. Guirguis, pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive, in perpetuity, license,
with a right to sublicense, in the Territory (Canada, the United States and Mexico) the Zeus Know-How which consists of all
information related to the manufacture and commercialization of saliva tests derived from patents owned by Zeus. We paid Zeus a one-time,
non-refundable up-front cash fee of 35,000 (which is creditable against other payments due) and will pay Zeus a royalty on Net
Sales (as defined in the License Agreement) of seven and one-half Percent (7.5 during each calendar quarter. 

Following
the closing of the Acquisition, our business has begun to focus on the EZ Saliva product commercialization activity previously carried
on by Point. 

The
description of the agreement discussed above does not purport to be complete and the reader should refer to the full text of the agreements
as exhibits to our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on June 10, 2024. 

On
November 21, 2023, the Company changed transfer agents to ClearTrust, LLC from Sedona Equity Registrar Transfer. 

On
February 28, 2023, the Company changed transfer agents to Sedona Equity Registrar Transfer, Inc. from Vstock Transfer. 

U.S.
patent application 16/930,604 was allowed on March 29, 2023, and is expected to issue in the near future, further strengthening
our subsidiary, DSI, intellectual property position and coverage for its DUOS products. The allowed claims are directed to an edible
pet chew that contains a thermo-processed shell having a cylindrical shape and that includes cellulosic fibers, a humectant, and a gelling
agent, and within the shell is a cold-formed filler that contains a fat mimicking composition and a thermally labile active containing
an enzyme. The pet chew provides oral care properties and contains thermal labile nutrients and/or actives whose nutrient values
and activities are preserved. The pet chews provide salivatory stimulation when consumed by the pet, which in combination with
the other ingredients of the pet chew provide dental care properties to remove dental plaque, stain, and tartar on a tooth surface, as
well as protection of the oral and perioral tissues. A continuation patent application seeking to further protect the pet
chew oral care technology was also filed. The application has been assigned serial number 18/133,381 and the filing date was April 11,
2023. 

On
December 12, 2022, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Global Foods Group, LLC GFG and its principal
shareholder pursuant to which it agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of GFG, consisting of assets relating to the sugar
substitute that GFG has been developing, Jaca . In exchange for the Jaca related assets, the Company would issue to GFG
and its designees 7,000,000 shares of our common stock. Upon the closing of this transaction, which would effect a change of control
of the Company, Peter Ferrari, the principal of the controlling member of GFG, was to become the CEO and a director of the Company and
Nicholas DeVito, the current CEO and controlling stockholder of the Company though the 1,000 shares of super-majority Class A Preferred
Stock that he holds, was to retain his positions with the Company as Treasurer, Secretary and Chief Financial Officer and director, and
he was to exchange his Class A Preferred shares for 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company. On January 26, 2023, GFG terminated
the asset purchase agreement in accordance with Section 3(e) of the agreement. 

Historical
Development 

The
Company was incorporated as Alternative Energy Environmental Solutions, Inc. in the State of Nevada on June 10, 2010,
to develop and license an innovative biotechnology for the environmentally friendly and cost-effective extraction of natural gas (coalbed
methane) from low-producing, depleted and abandoned coal mines in the U.S. The Company was not successful in developing this business
and discontinued its related operations. 

The
Company changed its name in 2014 to Unique Growing Solutions, Inc. and again in 2015 to Point of Care Nano-Technology, Inc. 

5 

On
February 25, 2015, the Company entered into an exclusive worldwide license Agreement (the License Agreement with Lamina
Equities Corporation Lamina ), a private corporation owned by Dr. Raouf Guirguis. The License Agreement related to intellectual
property for diagnosing illness in humans via a saliva test. In connection with signing the License Agreement, the Company appointed
Dr. Guirguis as its Chief Executive Officer and issued to him 750,000 shares of its common stock, 0.0001 par value per share, resulting
in a change of control of the Company with Dr. Guirguis becoming our majority stockholder. We did not have, however, the financial resources
to pursue business development relating to the Lamina license at that time. 

On
April 15, 2021, Dr. Guirguis resigned from all of his positions with the Company appointing Mr. Nicholas DeVito as Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary and sole director. In consideration for the services that Mr. DeVito would be
providing to the Company, the Company issued to Mr. DeVito 1,000 shares of its super-voting, non-convertible Class A preferred stock.
These shares of non-convertible Class A preferred stock voted together with the outstanding shares of our common stock as a single class
and represented eighty percent (80 of all votes entitled to be voted at any annual or special meeting of our shareholders or action
by written consent of shareholders. This issuance of the 1,000 shares of Series A non-convertible preferred stock to Mr. DeVito constituted
a change of control of the Company giving Mr. DeVito control of 80 of the voting power of the Company. Mr. DeVito has since surrendered
those shares to us and they have now been cancelled. 

The
Company and Dr. Guirguis entered into a certain assignment and assumption agreement and a separate transfer agreement (together, the
 Spin Off Agreements pursuant to which the Company transferred to DRG Transfer Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company DRG ), all of the legacy assets of the Company as of April 15, 2021, comprised as of that date
of the License Agreement and the name of the Company (i.e., Point of Care Nanotechnology, Inc.) and any outstanding debts of the Company
generated while Dr. Guirguis operated the Company, measured as of April 15, 2021, which as of that date consisted solely of unknown contingent
liabilities (which cannot be identified or quantified at this time and which are expected to be non-material or nil). The Company transferred
ownership of DRG to Dr. Guirguis in exchange for the return of 520,000 shares of our common stock then held by Dr. Guirguis (The Consideration
Shares ). Dr. Guirguis agreed to allow the Company to continue to use its existing name for an indefinite period of time. 

On
April 11, 2022, we, through our newly established, wholly owned subsidiary, Duo Sciences, Inc. DSI ), acquired an exclusive
license from Cedoga Consulting, LLC Cedoga to distribute in the USA, Canada and Mexico, certain intellectual property of
Cedoga relating to animal nutrition and animal supplements (the Cedoga IP ). In exchange for these license rights, we agreed
to issue Cedoga 300,000 shares of our common stock. Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay Cedoga royalties from sub-licensing
the Cedoga IP on the following terms: 

90 
 of net royalties for sales and initial payments up to 100,000,000 per calendar year; 

95 
 of net royalties received for continuing sales above 100,000,000 per calendar year; and 

90 
 of any lump sum up-front payment sub-licensing fees. 

We
also gave Cedoga an option to purchase 200,000 shares of our common stock when net sales of the Cedoga IP exceed 100,000,000. 

On
April 19, 2022, we, through DSI, signed an exclusive representative and sublicensing agreement with Lucy Pet Products Inc. Lucy pursuant to which Lucy has agreed to manufacture, market and distribute on our behalf pet products created from
the Cedoga IP. Lucy paid us a one-time sublicensing fee of 100,000 on the signing of this agreement and will pay us royalties equal
to 5 of their Net Revenue, calculated and payable quarterly. Other Income, for purposes of our agreement with Lucy, is defined as
total monies received less direct cost of materials, manufacturing, packaging and delivery expenses and less excise, sales or
similar taxes. We are waiting for Lucy Pets to add manufacturing capacity that will allow for additional
revenues. 

On
May 20, 2024, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Point of Care Nano-Technology, LLC, or Point , the independent,
third party company established by Dr. Guirguis on completion of the Spin Off Agreements (discussed above), pursuant
to which we agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of Point for North America, consisting primarily of proprietary information
and know-how for the developing and commercialization of kits to diagnose illnesses through the testing of human saliva, referred to
as the EZ Saliva test kits, and cash in the amount of 101,400. We are currently selling EZ Saliva products to police departments,
testing laboratories and private businesses to test for the presence of controlled substances.

Our
Common Stock 

Our
common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Markets, Inc. Expert Market where quotations are restricted from public viewing, under the
symbol PCNT. Currently our common stock is not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations and the only quotes available,
if any, reflect unsolicited customer orders. In order for broker-dealers to begin quoting our stock once again we will have to make our
current information publicly available under SEC Rule 15c2-11, which we are in the process of doing. There can be no assurance that our
common stock will be able to return to a full quotation status on the OTC and we cannot assure you that an active trading market in our
common stock will ever develop. In the event that an active trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price
of our common stock, whether any trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained. 

Executive
Offices

principal executive office is located at 109 Ambersweet Way, Davenport FL, 33897 and our telephone number is (732) 723-7395. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

An
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should give careful consideration
to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this annual report, including our financial statements
and related notes, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the adverse developments
described in the following risk factors could materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition, results of operations
or prospects. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment . 

We
have a limited operational history. 

We
have a limited history upon which an evaluation of our prospects and future performance can be made. Our operations are subject to all
business risks associated with new enterprises. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses,
difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the expansion of a business operation in an emerging
industry, and the continued development of advertising, promotions, and a corresponding customer base. There is a possibility that we
could sustain losses in the future, and there are no assurances that we will ever operate profitably. 

Our
auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

As
of July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, we had minimal cash or cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of 120,978,899 and 120,900,882,
respectively. Our audited financial statements for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 were prepared using the assumption that we
will continue our operations as a going concern. Our independent accountants in their audit report have expressed substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Our operations are dependent on our ability to raise sufficient capital or complete a business
combination as a result of which we become profitable. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. 

There
is not enough cash on hand to fund our administrative expenses and operating expenses for the next twelve months. Therefore, we may be
unable to continue operations in the future as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some
or all of their investment in our common stock. 

7 

Our
operational strategy is changing to be refocused on the Life Sciences space. 

We
expect our business growth to be generated through the development of our EZ Saliva business . No assurances can be made that we will
be successful in developing our EZ Saliva business. 

If
we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, we may not be able to fund our product development efforts and
acquisitions or fulfill our future obligations. 

Our
ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operations and business development efforts, including the potential
payment of cash consideration in acquisitions and the payment of our other obligations, depends on a range of economic, competitive and
business factors, many of which are outside of our control. We cannot assure you that our business will ever generate sufficient cash
flow from operations, or that we will be able to raise equity or debt financings when needed or desirable. An inability to fund our operations
would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further information, please
refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources 
below. 

Our
Acquisition presents many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate at the time of the Acquisition. 

Our
growth is dependent upon our ability to develop and successfully commercialize our acquired EZ Saliva business on a timely basis. Acquisitions,
including those of high-technology companies, are inherently risky. We cannot provide any assurance our Acquisition will be successful
in helping us reach our financial and strategic goals. The risks we commonly encounter in undertaking, managing and integrating acquisitions
are: 

an
 uncertain revenue and earnings stream from the acquired company; 

difficulties
 and delays integrating the personnel, operations, technologies, products and systems of the acquired companies; 

the
 need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked
 such controls, procedures and policies; 

difficulties
 managing or integrating an acquired company s technologies or lines of business; 

potential
 difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in-process research and development; 

entry
 into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions and which
 are highly competitive; 

the
 potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; 

potential
 difficulties integrating acquired products and services into our operational framework; 

assuming
 pre-existing contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification
 of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; 

being
 subject to unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired company s practices; and 

intellectual
 property claims or disputes. 

Our
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate our acquired assets due to these or other factors could have a material
adverse effect on our future business, results of operations and financial condition. We expect that other companies in our industry
will compete with us with products similar to our EZ Saliva test kits. Our competitors may have greater resources than we do to compete
in this sector. 

8 

We
will require substantial funding which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise the necessary capital,
we may be unable to successfully implement our business plans. 

We
intend to expand our EZ Saliva business. We will require capital for operating expenses and capital expenditures. 

We
cannot be certain that funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital in sufficient amounts
or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or our business, The inability
to raise the required funds would significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. 

The
life-sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes. As a result, we may be unable to compete successfully,
which would harm our business. 

The
life-sciences industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. We expect to face intense competition from
other companies which have resources substantially greater than ours. This competitive disadvantage may make it extremely difficult for
us to acquire commercially viable life science assets. 

If
our EZ Saliva products are unable to compete effectively with marketed tests targeting similar indications as our EZ Saliva products,
 our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated. 

We
face competition generally from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government
agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise
in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing
approved products than we do. Small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative
arrangements with large, established companies. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and
commercialize any testing products that are more effective or are less expensive than our EZ Saliva products. These potential competitors
compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies and technology
licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. 

We
expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to: 

successfully
 identify and develop key points of product differentiations from currently available tests; 

successfully
 and rapidly complete trials and submit for and obtain all requisite regulatory approvals
 in a cost-effective manner; 

maintain
 a proprietary position for our products and manufacturing processes and other related product
 technology; 

attract
 and retain key personnel; 

develop
 relationships with law enforcement, forensic and hospital testing organizations to market
 and sell these products; and 

build
 an adequate sales and marketing infrastructure for our product candidates. 

Because
we will be competing against significantly larger companies with established track records, we will have to demonstrate that, based on
experience, data, test effectiveness profiles and other factors, our products, if approved, are competitive with other products. If we
are unable to compete effectively and differentiate our products from other marketed tests, we may never generate meaningful revenue. 

9 

We
currently have no sales and marketing organization. If we are unable to establish a direct sales force in the United States to promote
our EZ Saliva products, the commercial opportunity for our products may be diminished. 

We
currently have no sales and marketing organization. We will incur significant additional expenses and commit significant additional management
resources to establish our sales force. We may not be able to establish these capabilities despite these additional expenditures. We
will also have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire and train sales and marketing personnel.
If we elect to rely on third parties to sell our EZ Saliva products in the United States, we may receive less revenue than if we sold
our products directly. In addition, although we would intend to use due diligence in monitoring their activities, we may have little
or no control over the sales efforts of those third parties. In the event we are unable to develop our own sales force or collaborate
with a third party to sell our EZ Saliva products, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our EZ Saliva products which would
negatively impact our ability to generate revenue. 

Materials
necessary to manufacture our EZ Saliva products may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at
all, which may delay the development and commercialization of our EZ Saliva products. 

We
will rely on the third-party manufacturers of our EZ Saliva products to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to
produce test kits for sales or future trials with commercial organizations and government organizations and we will rely on such manufacturers
to purchase such materials to produce the finished products for any commercial distribution of our EZ Saliva products. Suppliers may
not sell these materials to our manufacturers at the time they need them to meet our required delivery schedule or on commercially reasonable
terms, if at all. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these materials by our manufacturers. Moreover,
we currently do not have any agreements for the production of these materials. If our future manufacturers are unable to obtain these
materials for our test kits would be delayed, which may significantly impact our ability to generate revenue. If we or our future manufacturers
are unable to purchase these materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for one of our products, the commercial launch or
delivery of such product would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply of such product, which would harm our ability to generate
revenues from such product and achieve or sustain profitability. 

If
we are unable to adequately protect or expand our intellectual property related to our current or future products, our business prospects
could be harmed. 

Our
success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain trademark or patent protection,
as the case may be, for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties
from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. 

We
will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our
proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable trademarks or patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. The patent
position of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, we cannot predict
with certainty whether we will be able to ultimately enforce our patents or proprietary rights. Therefore, any issued patents that we
own or otherwise have intellectual property rights to may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and may not provide us with the
protection against competitors that we anticipate. The degree of future protection for our proprietary intellectual property rights is
uncertain because issued patents and other legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit
us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. 

General
Economic Risks 

Our
current and future business objectives and plan of operation are likely dependent, in large part, on the state of the general economy.
Adverse changes in economic conditions may adversely affect our business objective and plan of operation. These conditions and other
factors beyond our control include also, but are not limited to regulatory changes. 

10 

Risks
Related to Our common stock 

Our
shares of common stock are traded from time to time on the OTC Markets, Inc. Expert Market. 

Our
common stock currently trades on the OTC Markets, Inc. Expert Market and is not currently eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations.
Any quotes in our stock reflect unsolicited customer orders and are restricted from public viewing. In order for brokers to once again
publish competing quotes and provide continuous market making in our stock, we will need to have our publicly available information reviewed
by a broker-dealer under SEC rule 15c2-11 and approved by OTC Markets, Inc. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully
complete this relisting process or that there will ever be a liquid trading market for our common stock. In the event that a liquid trading
market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price of our common stock, whether any trading market will provide liquidity
to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained. 

The
application of the penny stock rules could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase your transaction
costs to sell those shares. 

The
SEC adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined)
less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. If the trading price
of our common stock falls below 5.00 per share, the open-market trading of our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules,
which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited
investors. The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of 5,000,000 or individuals
with a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules
require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk
disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in
the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the
compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each
penny stock held in the customer s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information,
must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before
or with the customer s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not
otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable
investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may
have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock
rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe the penny stock
rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. 

FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our common stock. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to
a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending
speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information
about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules,
FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers.
FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit
your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. 

Stockholders
should have no expectation of any dividends. 

The
holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally
available therefore. To date, we have not declared or paid any cash dividends. Our board of directors does not intend to declare any
dividends in the foreseeable future, but instead intends to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations. 

11 

Our
President and CEO and our two majority stockholders are in a position to control all actions requiring stockholder vote. 

After
completion of the Acquisition, our two new stockholders and directors control a majority of our outstanding voting common stock. This
ownership interest gives these stockholders controlling influence over our business, including decisions regarding mergers, consolidations
and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions. This concentration
of ownership may also have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a future change of control. Additionally, we have no present
intention to call for an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors. As a result, our current directors will continue in office
for the indefinite future. If there is an annual meeting of stockholders for any reason, our management has broad discretion regarding
proposals submitted to a vote by shareholders as a consequence of management s controlling equity interest. Accordingly, our current
board of directors and management will continue to exert control indefinitely. 

Management
has broad discretion in decision making. 

Any
person who invests in our common stock will do so without an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any prospective
asset acquisition or business combination. As a result, investors will be entirely dependent on the broad discretion and judgment of
our management in connection with the selection of a prospective business opportunity. There can be no assurance that determinations
made by our management will permit us to achieve our business objectives. 

Certain
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, and of Nevada law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which
could decrease the trading price of our common stock. 

Our
certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Nevada law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate
takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate
with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: 

the
 inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting; 

rules regarding
 how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; 

the
 right of our board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; 

the
 ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors. 

Future
sales and issuances of our common stock or could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could
cause our share price to fall. 

We
expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise capital
by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities
or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock,
convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales.
Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing
stockholders. 

We
may be at risk of securities class action litigation. 

We
may be at risk of securities class action litigation. In the past, life sciences, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced
significant stock price volatility, particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals. If
we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could
harm our business and results in a decline in the market price of our common stock. 

12 

Management
identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and failure to remediate it or any future ineffectiveness of internal controls
could have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of its common stock. 

Our
management determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls were ineffective as of July 31, 2023 and 2022
and if they continue to be ineffective could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. 

Management
continues to review our internal control systems, processes and procedures for compliance with the requirements of a smaller reporting
company under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such a review resulted in identification of material weaknesses in our internal
controls and a conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting ICFR were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

A
 material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in ICFR, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We plan
to take measures to remediate these deficiencies, such as providing additional training to our accounting staff in US GAAP. However,
the implementation of these measures may not fully address the control deficiencies in our ICFR. Our failure to address any control deficiency
could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting
requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis. Moreover, effective ICFR is important to prevent fraud. As a result, our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the trading price of our shares, may be negatively impacted
by a failure to accurately report financial results. 

The
material weaknesses and other matters impacting our internal controls may cause it to be unable to report its financial information on
a timely basis and thereby subject it to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of applicable
stock exchange or quotation service listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of
investor confidence in the Company and the reliability of its financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements
may suffer due to our reporting of material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely
affect the Company and lead to a decline in the price of its common stock. 

If
we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover
material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly
and raising capital could be more difficult. 

If
we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover
additional material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline
significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable
financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud,
our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading
price of our common stock could drop significantly. In addition, we cannot be certain that additional material weaknesses or significant
deficiencies in our internal controls will not be discovered in the future.

Information 

Our
common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Markets, Inc. Expert Market where quotations are restricted from public viewing, under the
symbol PCNT. Currently our common stock is not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations and the only quotes available,
if any, reflect unsolicited customer orders. In order for broker-dealers to begin quoting our stock once again we will have to make our
current information publicly available under SEC Rule 15c2-11, which we are in the process of doing. There can be no assurance that our
common stock will be able to return to a full quotation status on the OTC and we cannot assure you that an active trading market in our
common stock will ever develop. In the event that an active trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price
of our common stock, whether any trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained. 

Description
of Our Common Stock 

We
are authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares, par value 0.0001 per share, of common stock, of which 72,690,621 shares were issued and
outstanding as of October 29, 2024 . Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on each matter submitted to
a vote at any meeting of stockholders. Shares of common stock do not carry cumulative voting rights and, therefore, holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of common stock will be able to elect the entire Board of Directors, and, if they do so, minority stockholders
would not be able to elect any members to the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has authority, without action by the stockholders,
to issue all or any portion of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, which would reduce the percentage ownership of the
stockholders and which may dilute the book value of the common stock. Stockholders have no pre-emptive rights to acquire additional shares
of common stock. The common stock is not subject to redemption and carries no subscription or conversion rights. In the event of liquidation,
the shares of common stock are entitled to share equally in corporate assets after satisfaction of all liabilities. The shares of common
stock, when issued, will be fully paid and non-assessable. 

Holders
of common stock are entitled to receive dividends as our board of directors may from time to time declare out of funds legally available
for the payment of dividends. We have not paid dividends on common stock and do not anticipate that we will pay dividends in the foreseeable
future. 

All
shares of common stock now outstanding are duly authorized, fully paid and non-assessable.

Overview 

The
Company was incorporated as Alternative Energy Environmental Solutions, Inc. in the State of Nevada on June 10, 2010,
to develop and license an innovative biotechnology for the environmentally friendly and cost-effective extraction of natural gas (coalbed
methane) from low-producing, depleted and abandoned coal mines in the U.S. The Company was not successful in developing this business
and discontinued its biotechnology related operations. The Company changed its name in 2014 to Unique Growing Solutions, Inc. and again
in 2015 to Point of Care Nano-Technology, Inc. 

On
February 25, 2015, the Company entered into the License Agreement with Lamina relating to intellectual property for diagnosing illness
in humans via a saliva test. During the past few years, the Company did not have the financial resources to pursue business development
relating to the Lamina license and this business was discontinued and split off. 

On
April 11, 2022, we, through our newly established, wholly owned subsidiary, DSI, acquired an exclusive license from Cedoga to distribute
in the USA, Canada and Mexico, certain intellectual property of Cedoga relating to animal nutrition and animal supplements. On April
19, 2022, we, through DSI, signed an exclusive representative and sublicensing agreement with Lucy Pet Products Inc. pursuant to which
Lucy has agreed to manufacture, market and distribute on our behalf pet products created from the Cedoga IP. There can be no assurance
that we will be successful marketing the Cedoga IP or that Lucy or other sublicensees of the Cedoga IP will be successful in their business
development efforts. 

On
May 20, 2024, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Point of Care Nano-Technology, LLC pursuant to which we agreed to acquire
substantially all of the assets of Point for North America, consisting primarily of proprietary information and know-how for the developing
and commercialization of kits to diagnose illnesses through the testing of human saliva, referred to as the EZ Saliva test
kits, and cash in the amount of 101,400. We are currently selling EZ Saliva testing products to police departments, testing laboratories
and private businesses to test for the presence of controlled substances. 

Our
plan of operation for the next 12 months is to build our EZ Saliva business through traditional direct sales and marketing efforts to
police departments and lab test companies in North America. 

Additionally,
we can make no guarantees that we will be successful in achieving any of our new operational objectives. 

Results
of Operations 

Fiscal
Year ended July 31, 2023 compared to the Fiscal Year ended July 31, 2022 

Revenues 

For
the years ended July 31, 2023, we generated 0 of revenue from product licenses as compared to 0 revenue of any kind for year ending
July 31, 2022. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

For
the years ended July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, we did not incur any cost of goods sold expenses from product licenses, maintenance,
services or other expenses. 

16 

Operating
Expenses 

For
the year ended July 31, 2023, we did not incur any operating expenses from product licenses, and for the year ending July 31, 2022, we
incurred 0 of operating expenses from product licenses. We incurred administrative expenses of 78,017 for the year
ended July 31, 2023 and 73,515 for the year ended July 31, 2022. 

Net
Other Income (Expense 

For the years ended July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022,
we incurred net other income (expense) of -0- and 615,000) respectively. In 2022 we received 100,000 of royalty income from Lucy Pets
which was offset with 90,000 of other expense due to Cedoga. The remaining other expense was generated from a license impairment. 

Liquidity
 Capital Resources 

At
July 31, 2023, we had 498 in cash, compared to 3,198 at July 31, 2022. At July 31, 2023, our accumulated stockholders deficit
was 120,978,899 compared to 120,900,882 at July 31, 2022. There is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
have had no net positive cash flow for the two years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022. In the future, our cash flow will depend on the timely
and successful market entry of our expected strategic offerings and our ability to raise capital. 

In
2022, we received into treasury 520,000 shares of common stock in connection with our settlement agreement with the previous director.
We are required to issue 300,000 shares of our common stock for acquiring a license agreement. In 2023 we cancelled the 520,000 shares
received from a former Director in accordance with our settlement agreement. In addition, we raised 20,000 from
one investor and we issued him 150,000 shares of Common Stock on October 29, 2024.. 

Especially
for strategic offerings for paradigm shifting technologies, our management s budget plan is based on a series of assumptions regarding
the amount of capital needed to pursue regulatory approval, market acceptance, readiness and pricing for any new life science product
we may acquire. While management s assumptions are based on market research, assumptions bear the risk of being incorrect and may
result in a delay in projects, delays in regulatory approvals and consequently a delay or a reduction in the related strategic offerings.
In case these delays have an impact on our liquidity and therefore our ability to support our operations with the necessary cash flow,
we expect to depend on our ability to generate cash flow from other resources, such as debt financing from related or independent resources
or as equity financing from existing stockholders or through the stock market. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be successful
in raising required funding on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 

Plan
of Operations 

During
the remainder of our fiscal year ending July 31, 2024 and for the following 12 months, our plan of operation is to build our EZ Saliva
business through traditional direct sales and marketing efforts to police departments and lab test companies in North America. We will
need to seek external sources of capital for financing this business development. These sources may also provide the necessary funds
to support our ongoing working capital needs. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to obtain additional funds or
that such funds will be sufficient to permit us to successfully implement our intended business strategy. In the event we are not able
to raise funds, our management will have to postpone the further development of our EZ Saliva product. Additionally, our management believes
we will need to raise money to support our standard operations for the remainder of the current fiscal year ending July 31, 2024 and
for the following 12 months. 

Our
cash balance as reported in our financial statements is not sufficient to fund our growth plan for any period of time. In order to fully
implement our plan of operations for the next 12-month period, we will need to raise a significant amount of capital through future offerings.
After the next 12-month period, we most likely will need to raise additional financing as well. The discussion below is based on the
assumption that we will be able to raise significant capital in the remainder of our fiscal year ending July 31, 2024. We do not currently
have any arrangements for any such financing and there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the required capital on acceptable
terms, if at all. 

17 

We
have generated minimal revenues to date and, although we expect to raise significant capital in the future, there can be no assurances
that we will be successful in these endeavors. We believe that the actions presently being taken to further implement our business plan
and generate revenues will provide the opportunity for us to develop into a successful business operation. 

We
can provide no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully acquire additional assets or raise sufficient funds in the next
six months or longer to continue to execute our plans, to reach or to develop, offer and generate revenues from any of our designated
business activities and development actions. Also, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital or debt as and
when needed on acceptable terms if at all.

addition to business development expenses, we expect to incur additional administrative expenses during the next 12 months. We estimate
that we will need the following amounts during the next 12 months to cover the indicated administrative expenses:

and anticipated relisting fees for the OTC Markets, Inc. However, there can be no assurance that we will qualify for relisting to the
OTC Market. The table above does not include a line item for funds required to expend developing our EZ Saliva business. Any such funds
will be in amounts in addition to those listed in the table. 

Required
funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership
of our shares. There is no assurance that we will be able to generate operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return
on their investment in our common stock, or that we will be able to raise sufficient capital required to implement our business plan
on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we are successful in raising sufficient capital to implement our business plan, we may continue
to be unprofitable. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, the more significant of which are as follows: 

Consolidation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statement include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Duo Sciences Inc. DSI 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new
information becomes available to management. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

18 

Financial
Instruments 

Financial
instruments consist of cash and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying amounts of the financial instruments approximate
their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature of the underlying terms are consistent with market terms. As of the financial
statement date, the Company does not hold any derivate financial instruments. Financial assets and liabilities are measured upon first
recognition and reviewed at the financial statement date. Changes in fair value are recognized through profit and loss. Unless otherwise
noted, it is management s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial
instruments. 

Fair
Value Measurements 

The
Company follows FASB Codification topic ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for all financial instruments
and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. This new accounting standard establishes a single definition
of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value, sets out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information
used in fair value measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements.
It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. The Company defines fair value as the
price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at
fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based
risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer
restrictions and credit risk. 

The
Company has adopted FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments, which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option
for any eligible financial instruments. 

An
asset or liability s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the
fair value measurement. Availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a variety of factors. The Company uses judgment
in determining fair value of assets and liabilities, and Level 3 assets and liabilities involve greater judgment than Level 1 and Level
2 assets or liabilities. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Effective
August 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , using the modified retrospective
transition method as permissible for all contracts not yet completed as of August 1, 2018. This standard applies to all contracts with
customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and
financial instruments. 

Under
Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the
consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements
that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contracts)
with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the
transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance
obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration
it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. 

19 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 ). Under ASC Topic 740, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount expected to be realized. As the Company has yet to produce positive cash flows from operations, no deferred tax asset or income
taxes have been recorded in the financial statements. 

Comprehensive
Income (Loss) 

The
Company adopted FASB ASC 220, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive
income and its components in the financial statements. Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting
stockholder s equity that are excluded from net income, such as unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale, foreign
currency translation gains and losses and minimum pension liability. Since inception, the Company has not had any comprehensive income
/ loss. 

Net
Income (Loss) per Common Share 

FASB
ASC 260, Earnings per share, requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) with a reconciliation of the numerator
and denominator of the EPS computations. Basic earnings per share amounts are based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding.
If applicable, diluted earnings per share would assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock instruments
such as options, warrants and convertible securities, unless the effect is to reduce a loss or increase earnings per share. Diluted net
income (loss) per share on the potential exercise of the equity-based financial instruments is not presented where anti-dilutive. Accordingly,
although the diluted weighted average number of common stock outstanding is disclosed on the statements of operation, the calculated
net loss per share is the same for bother basic and diluted as both are based on the basic weighted average of common stock outstanding.
There were no adjustments required to net income for the period presented in the computation of diluted earnings per share. 

Segment
Reporting 

FASB
ASC 820, Segments Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent
with our internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major customers in financial
statements. The Company currently operates in one principal business segment. 

Intangible
assets 

Intangible
asset are non-monetary identifiable assets, controlled by the Company that will produce future economic benefits, based on reasonable
and supportable assumptions about conditions that will exist over the life of the asset. An intangible asset that does not meet these
attributes will be recognized as an expense when it is incurred. Intangible assets that do, are capitalized and initially measure at
cost. Those with a determinable life will be amortized on a systematic basis over their future economic life. Those with an indefinite
useful life shall not be amortized until its useful life is determined to be longer than indefinite. An intangible asset subject to amortization
shall be periodically reviewed for impairment . We recorded an impairment of 625,000 on the Lucy Pets license on July
31, 2022 to reflect our internal analysis of future discounted cash flows. A recoverability test will be performed and, if applicable,
unscheduled amortization is considered. 

The
license agreements has been capitalized, recorded at cost and amortized over its estimated useful life of ten years. Amortization has
been determined based on a pro rata basis over the expected cash flows. 

20 

Non-cash
transactions 

The
Company follows FASB ASC 845 then recording non-cash transactions. The value of the asset received should be based on the value of the
assets surrendered. However, where that value is difficult to determine, then the value could be based on the asset received, provided
it is more clearly evident than the value of the asset surrendered. 

Related
Parties 

The
Company adopted FASB ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company adopts new pronouncements relating to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Company as they are issued,
which may be in advance of their effective date. The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements
to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flow. 

The
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, the more significant of which are as follows:

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of July 31, 2023, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial
Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), Mr. Nicholas P. DeVito, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of July 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in
ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting ICFR ), as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. ICFR refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our
Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), and includes those policies and procedures that: 

(i) 
 Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
 assets of the Company; 

(ii) 
 Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
 of the Company; and 

(iii) 
 Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of an unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, ICFR may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in ICFR, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Management
has evaluated the effectiveness of our ICFR as of July 31, 2022 and 2023. Management based its assessment on the framework
set forth in COSO s Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) in conjunction with SEC Release No. 33-8810 entitled Commission
Guidance Regarding Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (17 CFR PART 241; Effective June 27, 2007). 

Because
of the material weaknesses described below, management concluded that our ICFR was not effective as of July 31, 2023: 

Our
 lack of sufficient accounting personnel with the requisite knowledge of GAAP and the financial reporting requirements of the SEC. 

Lack
 of segregation of duties of internal accounting and SEC reporting departments. 

We
plan to take measures to remediate these deficiencies, such as hiring additional qualified personnel and providing additional training
to our accounting staff in US GAAP, once we have the necessary financial resources. However, the implementation of these measures may
not fully address the control deficiencies in our ICFR. Our failure to address any control deficiency could result in inaccuracies in
our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and related regulatory
filings on a timely basis. Moreover, effective ICFR is important to prevent fraud. As a result, our business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects, as well as the trading price of our shares, may be negatively impacted by a failure to accurately report
financial results. 

The
material weaknesses and other matters impacting our internal controls may cause it to be unable to report its financial information on
a timely basis and thereby subject it to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of applicable
stock exchange or quotation service listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of
investor confidence in the Company and the reliability of its financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements
may suffer due to our reporting of material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely
affect the Company and lead to a decline in the price of its common stock. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (ICFR) 

During
the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2023, there were no changes in our ICFR that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our ICFR. 

22 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding ICFR. Management s report
was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide
only management s report in this annual report.

9B. Other Information. 

Subsequent
Events: 

On
May 20, 2024, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Point of Care Nano-Technology, LLC Point ), an unrelated company
established by Dr. Guirguis as a result of the Spin Off Agreements, pursuant to which it agreed to acquire substantially all of the North
American assets of Point, consisting primarily of proprietary information and know-how for the developing and commercialization of kits
to diagnose illnesses through the testing of human saliva, referred to as the EZ Saliva test kits, and cash in the amount
of 101,400. 

In
exchange for the Assets, we issued to Point and its designees 66,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock. 

Upon
the closing of the Acquisition, which effected a change of control of the Company, Dr. Raouf Guirguis, the controlling member of Point,
became a director of the Company and Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. Guirguis also acquired, directly and indirectly, 34,596,800 of the
Consideration Shares, or approximately 48.4 of the shares of our common stock outstanding after completion of the Acquisition. Mr. Nathan
Keele, an associate of Dr. Guirguis and responsible for marketing efforts at Point, also was appointed to the board of directors of the
Company. Mr. Keele will continue his marketing efforts at the Company. Mr. Keele acquired 18,903,200 of the Consideration Shares, or
approximately 26.5 of the shares of our common stock outstanding after completion of the Acquisition. 

Nicholas
DeVito, our controlling stockholder prior to the Acquisition through the 1,000 shares of super-majority class A preferred stock of the
Company that he held and through which he exercised eighty percent (80 voting control over the Company, surrendered to us for cancellation
the Preferred Stock and received, in exchange, 5,000,000 shares of our common stock. Mr. DeVito will retain his positions as Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company as well as his status as a member of our board of directors. 

The
shares of Company common stock being issued in connection with the Acquisition (as described above) were issued in accordance with a
private placement exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and are considered restricted
securities. 

In
connection with the Acquisition, the Company entered into a license agreement with Zeus Diagnostics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company controlled by Dr. Guirguis, pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive, in perpetuity, license, with a right to sublicense, in
the Territory (Canada, the United States and Mexico) to the Zeus Know-How which consists of all information related to the
manufacture and commercialization of saliva tests derived from patents owned by Zeus. The Company paid Zeus a one-time, non-refundable
up-front cash fee of 35,000 (which is creditable against other payments due) and will pay Zeus a royalty on Net Sales (as
defined in the License Agreement) of Seven and One-Half Percent (7.5 during each calendar quarter. 

Following
the closing of the Acquisition, our business has begun to focus on the EZ Saliva product commercialization activity previously carried
on by Point. 

On
September 20, 2024, we issued 1,270,000 shares of our common stock to three investors and raised 30,000. 

On
May 30, 2024, we engaged and executed an agreement with Fruci Associates II, PLLC as our new independent accountant for the fiscal
years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Point
of Care Nano-Technology, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Point of Care Nano-Technology, Inc. the Company as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, statement of deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2023, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company had
not yet achieved profitable operations and had accumulated losses. The Company will need to raise additional cash in order to fund ongoing
operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters. 

PCAOB ID #0 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2024.

The
Company s principal executive office location and mailing address is 109 Ambersweet Way, Davenport, FL 33897. 

At
July 31, 2023, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations and had accumulated losses of and had cash on
hand. The Company will need to raise additional cash in order to fund ongoing operations over the next 12 month period. These factors
which casts substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. No adjustments to the consolidated financial statements have
been made as a result of this concern. 

The
Company has adopted FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments, which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option
for any eligible financial instruments. 

An
asset or liability s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the
fair value measurement. Availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a variety of factors. The Company uses judgment
in determining fair value of assets and liabilities, and Level 3 assets and liabilities involve greater judgment than Level 1 and Level
2 assets or liabilities. 

shares of common stock, par value of per share, and shares of blank
check preferred stock, par value of per share, of which none have been designated as Series A Nonconvertible Preferred
Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock ). During the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company had the following transactions: 

Accordingly, all references to common shares in these financial statements reflect the reverse split. 

On
August 2, 2021, the Company issued Series A Preferred Stock to Nicholas DeVito , our Chief Executive Officer as compensation. The
Preferred Stock gives DeVito 80 control of the voting stock of the Company. Mr. DeVito surrendered his preferred shares in exchange
for 5,000,000 shares of Company common stock on May 21, 2024. 

On
April 10, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement under which it agreed to issue 300,000 common shares in order to obtain a license
to distribute product (See below). The Company has not yet issued those shares and the obligation to do so is recorded as a 
unissued stock in equity. 

On
April 15, 2022, as part of the Settlement agreement (See below), the Company received into treasury shares of common stock (26,000,000
pre reverse split shares). 

On
June 8, 2022, the Company received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to effect a 50:1 reverse split of our outstanding
common stock. The split was reflected in the public markets on June 9, 2022 and has been given retroactive disclosure in the financial
statements. Accordingly, all references to common shares in these financial statements reflect the reverse split. 

On
August 24, 2022, the Company completed a financing with an investor for 20,000 in exchange for Units consisting of (i) one
share of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share for 0.10 per share, (ii) one LOI option to purchase one share of common
stock for 0.20 per share upon the Company signing a letter of intent with a third party and (iii) one Agreement option to purchase one
share of common stock for 0.30 per share upon the Company signing an agreement with a third party. 

There
were no warrants or options outstanding as of July 31, 2023. 

The
license value has been based on the value of the common shares at the time of the transaction and originally valued at 750,000. After
further financial projection analysis we recorded an impairment of 625,000 reducing the total value of the license to 125,000.

In
connection with the Acquisition, the Company entered into a license agreement (the License Agreement with Zeus Diagnostics,
LLC Zeus ), a Delaware limited liability company controlled by Dr. Guirguis, pursuant to which the Company acquired an exclusive,
in perpetuity, license, with a right to sublicense, in the Territory (Canada, the United States and Mexico) to the Zeus Know-How 
which consists of all information related to the manufacture and commercialization of saliva tests derived from patents owned by Zeus.
The Company paid Zeus a one-time, non-refundable up-front cash fee of 35,000 (which is creditable against other payments due) and will
pay Zeus a royalty on Net Sales (as defined in the License Agreement) of Seven and One-Half Percent (7.5 during each calendar
quarter. 

Following
the closing of the Acquisition, business will focus on the EZ Saliva product commercialization activity previously carried on by Point.

On
October 2, 2024 the Company issued shares of common stock to three investors and raised .00.
