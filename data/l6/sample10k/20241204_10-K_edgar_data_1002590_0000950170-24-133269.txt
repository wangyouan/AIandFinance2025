Business Overview 
 We are a home heating oil and propane distributor and service provider to residential and commercial customers who heat their homes and buildings primarily in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. regions. As of September 30, 2024, we sold home heating oil and propane to approximately 404,600 full service residential and commercial customers and 61,700 customers on a delivery only basis. Approximately 266,000 of these customers, or 57 , are located in the New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. We believe we are the largest retail distributor of home heating oil in the United States, based upon sales volume with a market share in excess of 5.5 . We also sell gasoline and diesel fuel to approximately 26,800 customers. We install, maintain, and repair heating and air conditioning equipment and to a lesser extent provide these services outside of our heating oil and propane customer base including 20,800 service contracts for natural gas and other heating systems. During fiscal 2024, total sales were comprised of approximately 61 from home heating oil and propane, 21 from other petroleum products, the majority of which is diesel and gasoline, and 18 from the installation and repair of heating and air conditioning equipment and ancillary services. We provide home heating equipment repair service and natural gas service 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week, 52 weeks a year. These services are an integral part of our business, and are intended to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
 We conduct our business through an operating subsidiary, Petro Holdings, Inc., utilizing multiple local brand names, such as Petro Home Services, Meenan, and Griffith Energy Services, Inc. 
 We also offer several pricing alternatives to our residential home heating oil customers, including a variable price (market based) option and a price-protected option, the latter of which either sets the maximum price or a fixed price that a customer will pay. Users choose the plan they feel best suits them which we believe increases customer satisfaction. Approximately 95 of our full service residential and commercial home heating oil customers automatically receive deliveries based on prevailing weather conditions. In addition, approximately 31 of our residential customers take advantage of our smart pay budget payment plan under which their estimated annual oil and propane deliveries and service billings are paid for in a series of equal monthly installments. We use derivative instruments as needed to mitigate our exposure to market risks associated with our price-protected offerings and the storing of our physical home heating oil inventory. Given our size, we believe we are able to realize certain benefits of scale and provide consistent, strong customer service. 
 Currently, we have heating oil and/or propane customers in the following states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. 
 
 Industry Characteristics 
 Home heating oil is primarily used as a source of fuel to heat residences and businesses in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. According to the U.S. Department of Energy Energy Information Administration, Residential Energy Consumption Survey (released May 2022), these regions account for 82 (4.1 million of 5.0 million) of the households in the United States where heating oil is the main space-heating fuel and 19 (4.1 million of 21.9 million) of the homes in these regions use home heating oil as their main space-heating fuel. Our experience has been that customers have a tendency to increase their conservation efforts as the price of home heating oil increases, thereby reducing their consumption. 
 The retail home heating oil industry is mature, with total market demand expected to decline in the foreseeable future due to conversions to natural gas and electricity, availability of other alternative energy sources and the installations of more fuel efficient heating systems. Therefore, our ability to maintain our business or grow within the industry is dependent on the acquisition of other retail distributors, the success of our marketing programs, and the growth of our other service offerings. Based on our records, our customer conversions to natural gas and electricity have ranged between 1.1 and 1.6 per year over the last five years. We believe this may continue or even increase. In addition, there are legislative and regulatory efforts underway in several states seeking to encourage homeowners to reduce or even eliminate the consumption of fossil fuels that we sell. 
 5 

The retail home heating oil industry is highly fragmented, characterized by a large number of relatively small, independently owned and operated local distributors. Some businesses provide full service, as we do, and others offer delivery only on a cash-on-delivery basis, which we also do to a significantly lesser extent. In addition, the industry is complex and costly due to regulations, working capital requirements, and the costs and risks of hedging for price protected customers. 
 Propane is a by-product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining. Propane use falls into three broad categories: residential and commercial applications; industrial applications; and agricultural uses. In the residential and commercial markets, propane is used primarily for space heating, water heating, clothes drying and cooking. Industrial customers use propane generally as a motor fuel to power over-the-road vehicles, forklifts and stationary engines, to fire furnaces, as a cutting gas and in other process applications. In the agricultural market, propane is primarily used for tobacco curing, crop drying, poultry breeding and weed control. 
 The retail propane distribution industry is highly competitive and is generally serviced by large multi-state full-service distributors and small local independent distributors. Like the home heating oil industry, each retail propane distribution provider operates in its own competitive environment because propane distributors typically reside in close proximity to their customers. In most retail propane distribution markets, customers can choose from multiple distributors based on the quality of customer service, safety, reputation and price. 
 It is common practice in our business to price our liquid products to customers based on a per gallon margin over wholesale costs. As a result, we believe distributors such as ourselves generally seek to maintain their per gallon margins by passing wholesale price increases or decreases through to customers, thus insulating their margins from the volatility in wholesale prices. However, distributors may be unable or unwilling to pass the entire product cost changes through to customers. We believe this is especially true in the propane business. In these cases, significant decreases in per gallon margins may result when prices rise. The timing of cost pass-throughs can also significantly affect margins. (See Customers and Pricing for a discussion on our offerings). 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to increase Adjusted EBITDA (See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a definition) and cash flow by effectively managing operations while growing and retaining our customer base as a retail distributor of home heating oil and propane and provider of related products and services. The key elements of this strategy include the following: 
 Pursue select acquisitions Our senior management team has developed expertise in identifying acquisition opportunities and integrating acquired customers into our operations. We focus on acquiring companies within and outside our current footprint. 
 We actively pursue home heating oil only companies, propane companies, dual fuel (home heating oil and propane) companies and selectively target motor fuels acquisitions, especially where they are operating in the markets we currently serve. 
 Deliver superior customer service We are dedicated to consistently providing our customers with superior service and a positive customer experience to improve retention and drive additional revenue. We have established programs and conduct surveys to effectively measure customer satisfaction at certain brands. 
 We have deployed a customer relationship management solution at most of our larger brands. We believe this allows us to provide a more consistent customer experience as our employees will have a 360 degree-view of each customer with easy access to key customer information and customized dashboards to track individual employee performance. 
 We have resources dedicated to training employees to provide superior and consistent service and enhance the customer experience. This effort is supported, reinforced and monitored by our local management teams. 
 Provide complementary service offerings These offerings include, but are not limited to, the sales, service and installation of heating and air conditioning equipment, and standby home generators. In addition, we also repair and install natural gas heating systems. 
 6 

Pursue environmental sustainability opportunities We are committed to pursuing initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our product offerings, by offering biodiesel blended products and by offering energy efficient heating and air conditioning equipment to our customers . 
 Seasonality 
 Our fiscal year ends on September 30. All references to quarters and years respectively in this document are to fiscal quarters and years unless otherwise noted. The seasonal nature of our business results in the sale of approximately 30 of our volume of home heating oil and propane in the first fiscal quarter and 50 of our volume in the second fiscal quarter of each fiscal year, the peak heating season. Approximately 25 of our volume of motor fuel and other petroleum products is sold in each of the four fiscal quarters. We generally realize net income in our first and second fiscal quarters and net losses during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and we expect that the negative impact of seasonality on our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results will continue. In addition, sales volume typically fluctuates from year to year in response to variations in weather, wholesale energy prices and other factors. 
 Degree Day 
 A degree day is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption. Degree days are based on how far the average daily temperature departs from 65 F. Each degree of temperature above 65 F is counted as one cooling degree day, and each degree of temperature below 65 F is counted as one heating degree day. Degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a multi-year average to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual. Degree days are officially observed by the National Weather Service. 
 Every ten years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA computes and publishes average meteorological quantities, including the average temperature for the last 30 years by geographical location, and the corresponding degree days. The latest data covers the years from 1991 to 2020. Our calculations of normal weather are based on these published 30 year averages for heating degree days, weighted by volume for the locations where we have existing operations. Our operating and financial plans are based upon the published weather data for the last ten years. 
 Competition 
 Most of our operating locations compete with numerous distributors, primarily on the basis of price, reliability of service and response to customer needs. Each such location operates in its own competitive environment. 
 Customer Attrition 
 We measure net customer attrition for our full service residential and commercial home heating oil and propane customers. Net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through marketing efforts. Customers added through acquisitions are not included in the calculation of gross customer gains. However, additional customers that are obtained through marketing efforts at newly acquired businesses are included in these calculations from the point of closing going forward. Customer attrition percentage calculations include customers added through acquisitions in the denominators of the calculations on a weighted average basis from the closing date. Gross customer losses are the result of a number of factors, including price competition, move outs, credit losses and conversions to natural gas and electrified heating systems. (See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Customer Attrition.) 
 Customers and Pricing 
 The number of home heating oil customers comprise 78 of our product customer base, with propane customers comprising another 17 and motor fuel and other petroleum product customers making up the remaining 5 . (During fiscal 2024, we sold 253.4 million gallons of home heating oil and propane and 129.1 million gallons of motor fuel and other petroleum products.) 
 7 

Our full service home heating oil customer base is comprised of 96 residential customers and 4 commercial customers. Approximately 95 of our full service residential and commercial home heating oil customers have their deliveries scheduled automatically and 5 of our home heating oil customer base call from time to time to schedule a delivery. Automatic deliveries are scheduled based on each customer s historical consumption pattern and prevailing weather conditions. Our practice is to bill customers promptly after delivery. We offer a balanced payment plan to residential customers in which a customer s estimated annual oil purchases and service contract fees are paid for in a series of equal monthly payments. Approximately 31 of our residential home heating oil customers have selected this billing option. 
 We offer several pricing alternatives to our residential home heating oil customers. Our "variable" pricing program allows the price to float with the heating oil market and other factors. In addition, we offer price-protected programs, which establish either a "ceiling" or a "fixed price" per gallon that the customer pays over a defined period. The following chart depicts the percentage of the pricing plans selected by our residential home heating oil customers as of the end of the fiscal year.

Sales to residential customers ordinarily generate higher per gallon margins than sales to commercial customers. Due to greater price sensitivity, our own internal marketing efforts, and hedging costs of residential price-protected customers, the per gallon margins realized from price-protected customers generally are less than from variable priced residential customers. 
 The propane customer base has a similar profile to heating oil residential and commercial customers. Sales to residential customers ordinarily generate higher per gallon margins than sales to commercial customers. Pricing plans chosen by propane customers are almost exclusively variable in nature where selling prices will float with the propane market and other commercial factors. 
 The motor fuel and other petroleum products customer group includes commercial and industrial customers of unbranded diesel, gasoline, kerosene and related distillate products. We sell products to these customers through contracts of various terms or through a competitive bidding process. 
 Derivatives 
 We use derivative instruments in order to mitigate our exposure to market risk associated with the purchase of home heating oil for our price-protected customers, physical inventory on hand, inventory in transit, priced purchase commitments, and the variable interest rate on a portion of our term loan. Currently, the Company s derivative instruments are with the following counterparties: Bank of America, N.A., Bank of Montreal, Cargill, Inc., Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Key Bank, N.A., Mieco LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 815-10-05, Derivatives and Hedging, requires that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. To the extent our interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are effective, as defined under this guidance, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We have elected not to designate our commodity derivative instruments as hedging instruments under this guidance, and as a result, the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments during the holding period are recognized in our statement of operations. Therefore, we experience volatility in earnings as outstanding derivative instruments are marked-to-market and non-cash gains and losses are recorded prior to the sale of the commodity to the customer. The volatility in any given period related to unrealized non-cash gains or losses on derivative instruments can be significant to our overall results. However, we ultimately expect those gains and losses to be offset by the cost of product when purchased. 
 8 

Depending on the risk being hedged, realized gains and losses are recorded in cost of product, cost of installations and services, or delivery and branch expenses. 
 Suppliers and Supply Arrangements 
 We purchase our products for delivery in either barge, pipeline or truckload quantities. As of September 30, 2024 we had contracts with approximately 136 third-party terminal sites for the right to temporarily store petroleum products at their facilities. Home heating oil and propane purchases are made under supply contracts or on the spot market. We have entered into New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX"), Platts American Gulf Coast or Mont Belvieu based physical supply contracts for approximately 76 of our expected home heating oil and propane requirements for our full service residential and commercial customers for the fiscal 2025 heating season. For the fiscal year 2025 heating season, approximately 74 of the Company s contracted home heating oil volume with suppliers has a biofuel component. We also have entered into NYMEX or Platts American Gulf Coast based physical supply contracts for approximately 46 of our expected diesel and gasoline requirements for fiscal 2025. 
 During fiscal 2024, Shell Trading and Shell Oil Products US provided approximately 16 of our petroleum purchases and Motiva Enterprises LLC provided 15 of our petroleum product purchases. During fiscal 2023, Shell Trading and Shell Oil Products US provided approximately 18 of our petroleum purchases and Motiva Enterprises LLC provided 14 of our petroleum product purchases, respectively. Our supply contracts typically have terms of 6 to 12 months. For fiscal 2025, approximately 24 of our physical supply contracts are with Motiva Enterprises LLC. All of our supply contracts provide for minimum quantities and in most cases do not establish in advance the price of home heating oil or propane. This price is based upon a published index price at the time of delivery or pricing date plus an agreed upon differential. We believe that our policy of contracting for the majority of our anticipated supply needs with diverse and reliable sources will enable us to obtain sufficient product should unforeseen shortages develop in worldwide supplies. 
 Liquid Product Price Volatility 
 Volatility, which is reflected in the wholesale price of liquid products, including home heating oil, propane and motor fuels, has a larger impact on our business when prices rise. Home heating oil consumers are price sensitive to heating cost increases, and this often leads to customer conservation and increased gross customer losses. As a commodity, the price of home heating oil is generally impacted by many factors, including economic and geopolitical forces, and is closely linked to the price of diesel fuel. The volatility in the wholesale cost of diesel fuel as measured by the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX ), for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2020, through 2024, on a quarterly basis, is illustrated in the following chart (price per gallon):

Acquisitions 
 Part of our business strategy is to pursue select acquisitions. Each acquired company s operating results are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements starting on its acquisition date. Customer lists, other intangibles (excluding goodwill) and trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over seven to twenty years. 
 During fiscal 2024, the Company acquired one propane and four heating oil businesses for approximately 49.4 million in cash. The gross purchase price was allocated 40.4 million to intangible assets, 13.7 million to goodwill, 4.9 million to fixed assets and reduced by 9.6 million of negative working capital.

During fiscal 2023, the Company acquired one propane and two heating oil businesses for approximately 19.8 million in cash. The gross purchase price was allocated 10.4 million to intangible assets, 8.0 million to goodwill, 2.3 million to fixed assets and reduced by 0.9 million of negative working capital. 
 During fiscal 2022, the Company acquired five heating oil businesses for approximately 15.6 million (using 13.1 million in cash and assuming 2.5 million of liabilities). The gross purchase price was allocated 7.3 million to intangible assets, 3.1 million to goodwill, 5.6 million to fixed assets and reduced by 0.4 million of negative working capital. 
 Employees and Human Capital Management 
 We consider our employees a key factor to Star s success and we are focused on attracting and retaining the best employees at all levels of our business. In particular, our dedication to providing superior customer service depends significantly on employee satisfaction and retention. We strive to create a productive and collaborative work environment for our employees. Our human capital measures and objectives focus on safety of our employees, employee benefits, and employee development and training. 
 The safety of our employees and customers is paramount. We strive to ensure that all employees feel safe in their respective work environment. Since March 2020, a portion of our office personnel have worked remotely. We believe that our employees have adapted well and continue to be flexible to the changing working conditions. 
 To attract talent and meet the needs of our employees, we offer benefits packages for full-time employees. We offer a health and welfare and retirement program to all eligible employees. We also provide our employees with resources for professional development including technical training, feedback and performance reviews from supervisors, and management training. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 3,039 employees, of whom 909 were office, clerical and customer service personnel; 834 were equipment technicians; 474 were fuel delivery drivers and mechanics; 540 were management and 282 were employed in sales. Due to the seasonal nature of our business and depending on the demands of the 2025 heating season, we anticipate that we will augment our current staffing levels during the heating season from among the 295 employees on temporary leave of absence as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, considering seasonal and employees that are on leave, we had 1,362 (39 employees that are represented by 62 different collective bargaining agreements with local chapters of labor unions. There are 20 collective bargaining agreements up for renewal in fiscal 2025, covering approximately 419 employees (12 ). We believe that our relations with both our union and non-union employees are generally satisfactory. 
 Government Regulations 
 Regulations in Response to Climate Change . There is increasing attention in the United States and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gas GHG emissions, in particular, from the combustion of carbon-based fossil fuels. Our heating oil and propane products are widely considered to be fossil fuels that produce GHG emissions. To combat the cause of global warming domestically, President Biden identified climate change as one of his administration s top priorities and pledged to seek measures that would pave the path for the U.S. to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. In April 2021, President Biden announced the administration s plan to reduce the U.S. GHG emissions by at least 50 by 2030. These environmental goals earned a prominent place in the Biden administration s 1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which was signed into law on November 15, 2021. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act which aims to reduce GHG emissions by offering tax and other financial incentives designed to encourage homeowners to switch to alternative sources of energy other than those we sell, including a tax rebate of up to 8,000 per qualified household for the installation of an electric heat pump for a home s primary heat source. States must apply for rebate funding with the U.S. Department of Energy and adopt and administer energy rebate programs within their respective states before homeowners can apply and receive tax rebates under the program. As of October 2024, two (2) states within our operating footprint -- New York and Rhode Island have launched programs to distribute homeowner rebates. The timing of when the other states within our operating footprint will adopt energy rebate programs in order to distribute homeowner rebates remains uncertain. 
 10 

Numerous states and municipalities have also adopted laws and policies on climate change and emission reduction targets. For example, on July 18, 2019, the State of New York (location of approximately 44 of our residential home heating oil and propane customers) passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act CLCPA ). Among other things, the CLCPA sets out a series of emissions reduction, renewable energy, and energy storage goals to significantly reduce the use of carbon-based fossil fuels and eventually achieve net zero GHG emissions in the state. In December 2022, New York approved the Scoping Plan, which details actions required to advance directives stated in the CLCPA and to enable New York to limit GHG emissions as a percentage of 1990 emissions to 60 by 2030 and to 15 by 2050. However, the CLCPA gave the New York Department of Energy Conservation until January 1, 2024, to promulgate regulations to ensure that the State of New York meets the CLCPA s GHG emission limits as outlined in the Scoping Plan. The State of New York has not yet adopted regulations to implement the CLCPA s GHG emissions despite the January 1, 2024 deadline for doing so. 
 On May 2, 2023, the State of New York adopted its 2024 fiscal year budget, which included amendments to New York s Energy Law and to its Executive Law that prohibit the installation of fossil-fuel equipment and building systems in any new buildings under seven stories, except for a new commercial or industrial building greater than 100,000 square feet in conditioned floor area beginning December 31, 2025 (the Fossil Fuel Ban ). The Fossil Fuel Ban applies to equipment that uses heating oil, propane and natural gas for combustion and will then expand to all new buildings beginning January 1, 2029. Specifically, the Energy Law and the Executive Law direct the New York State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council (the Code Council to include the Fossil Fuel Ban on installation of fossil-fuel burning equipment and building systems in new buildings in the State of New York s Energy Conservation Construction Code (the Energy Code and in the Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code (the Building Code ). We understand that New York Building Code Council is set to integrate the Fossil Fuel Ban into its 2025 Building Code update. 
 On October 12, 2023, a coalition of businesses, trade associations and labor unions including the National Propane Gas Association, New York Propane Gas Association and Mulhern Gas Co., filed a federal lawsuit in the Northern District of New York (Mulhern Gas Co., Inc. et al v. Rodriguez, et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-1267) claiming that the Fossil Fuel Ban violates federal law. The lawsuit seeks to declare the Fossil Fuel Ban invalid and to block its enforcement on the grounds that it is preempted by the federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act ("EPCA"). It relies on a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (California Restaurant Association v. City of Berkeley) which held that a ban on gas piping in a new building in Berkeley, California was invalid on the basis that it concerned the energy use of appliances covered by the EPCA and was therefore preempted by federal law. As this legal challenge is ongoing, it remains uncertain what impact, if any, it will have on the Company s operations in the State of New York. 
 In May 2019, New York City (location of approximately 3 of our residential home heating oil and propane customers) enacted Local Law 97 as a part of the Climate Mobilization Act aimed at reducing GHG emissions by 80 from commercial and residential buildings by 2050. Starting in 2024, this law will place carbon caps on most buildings larger than 25,000 square feet. In addition, in December 2021, New York City passed Local Law 154 of 2021, which will phase out fossil fuel usage in newly constructed residential and commercial buildings starting in 2024 for lower-rise buildings, and in 2027 for taller buildings. With few exceptions, all new buildings constructed in New York City must be fully electric by 2027. 
 In March 2021, the State of Massachusetts (location of approximately 4 of our residential home heating oil and propane customers) signed into law An Act Creating A Next-Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy (the 2021 Climate Law that establishes a 2030 limit of at least a 50 reduction in GHG emissions below the 1990 GHG emissions baseline and requires the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs to set interim emissions limits and sector-specific sublimits every five years. The 2021 Climate Law tasks the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (the MassDEP with developing a high-level program to meet the emissions limit for residential, commercial, and industrial heating and identified a Clean Heat Standard CHS as a regulatory option for addressing this requirement. The proposed regulations released by MassDEP in May 2023 could require, among other things, heating energy suppliers to demonstrate the conversion of approximately 3 of their customers to electric heat each year. Such proposed regulations, if adopted, could dramatically negatively impact the Company s Massachusetts operations and impose onerous reporting requirements on the Company. The proposed regulations are in the comment period. 
 11 

On August 11, 2022, the State of Massachusetts signed into law An Act Driving Clean Energy and Offshore Wind (the 2022 Climate Law ). The 2022 Climate Law establishes a new pilot program to allow up to 10 municipalities to require through zoning that new construction or substantial renovation projects will be fossil-fuel free, and instructs the State s Department of Energy Resources DOER to adopt regulations to structure the pilot program. The DOER adopted final regulations structuring the pilot program in July 2023. The purpose of the pilot program is to allow the DOER to study the implementation of fossil fuel bans in municipalities and evaluate future best practices on decarbonization. As of January 2024, seven municipalities have been approved to begin enforcing the new zoning requirements. 
 These measures, which have or may have the effect of reducing or eliminating GHG emissions from fossil fuel-burning vehicles, boilers and furnaces, could significantly negatively impact the Company s operations in New York City, New York State and Massachusetts, which together constitute a material portion of the Company s business. Other states in which the Company operates and that are material to the Company s operations, such as Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Jersey, have adopted similar GHG laws or have otherwise announced GHG reduction targets. However, while we cannot predict at this time whether and in what manner the New York CLCPA, the Massachusetts 2021 Climate Law, the Massachusetts 2022 Climate Law, or other state and local GHG laws or targets could impact the Company, these measures could over time have a material negative impact on the Company. 
 Environmental and Safety Regulations. We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Generally, these laws impose limitations on the discharge or emission of pollutants and establish standards for the handling of solid and hazardous wastes. These laws include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA ), the Clean Air Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, the Clean Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act, and comparable state statutes. CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Products stored and/or delivered by us and certain automotive waste products generated by our fleet are hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA or otherwise subject to investigation and cleanup under other environmental laws and regulations. While we are currently not involved with any material CERCLA claims, and we have implemented programs and policies designed to address potential liabilities and costs under applicable environmental laws and regulations, failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties or injunctive relief in cases of non-compliance or impose liability for remediation costs. 
 We have incurred and continue to incur costs to address soil and groundwater contamination at some of our locations, including legacy contamination at properties that we have acquired. A number of our properties are currently undergoing remediation, in some instances funded by prior owners or operators contractually obligated to do so. To date, no material issues have arisen with respect to such prior owners or operators addressing such remediation, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case. In addition, we have been subject to proceedings by regulatory authorities for alleged violations of environmental and safety laws and regulations. We do not expect any of these liabilities or proceedings of which we are aware to result in material costs to, or disruptions of, our business or operations. 
 Transportation of our products by truck is subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations cover the transportation of hazardous materials and are administered by the United States Department of Transportation or similar state agencies. Several of our oil terminals are governed by the United States Coast Guard operations Oversite, Federal OPA 90 FRP programs and Federal Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure programs. All of our propane bulk terminals are governed under Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards programs. We conduct ongoing training programs to help ensure that our operations are in compliance with applicable regulations. We maintain various permits that are necessary to operate some of our facilities, some of which may be material to our operations.

ITEM 1A. 	 RIS K FACTORS 
 You should consider carefully the risk factors discussed below, as well as all other information, as an investment in the Company involves a high degree of risk. We are subject to certain risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and cash available for distributions to our unitholders, could result in a partial or total loss of your investment, and are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us. 
 Wholesale Product Price Volatility and Supply Risks Associated with our Business 
 Fluctuations in wholesale product costs may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 
 Increases in wholesale product costs may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the following: 
 reduced profit margins; 

customer conservation; 

customer attrition due to customers converting to lower cost heating products or suppliers; 

reduced liquidity as a result of higher net receivables including customer credit balances, and/or inventory balances as we must fund a portion of any increase in receivables, inventory and hedging costs from our own cash resources and thereby reduce or eliminate funds that would otherwise be available for distributions and other purposes; 

higher interest expense as a result of increased working capital borrowing to finance higher receivables and/or inventory balances; and higher bad debt expense and credit card processing costs as a result of higher selling prices. 

Our business is a margin-based business in which gross profit depends on the excess of sales prices per gallon over supply costs per gallon. Consequently, our profitability is sensitive to increases in the wholesale product cost caused by changes in supply, geopolitical forces and other market conditions. Although our wholesale product costs are closely linked to the price of diesel fuel, diesel fuel prices do not always correspond to increases or decreases in consumer demand for our products. Consequently, our wholesale product prices may rise even though demand for our heating oil products is down due to, among other things, warm winter temperatures. Significant increases in product costs result in higher operating expenses, such as credit card fees, bad debt expense, and vehicle fuels, and also lead to higher working capital requirements, including higher premiums and cash requirements for some of our hedging instruments. In certain cases, we cannot pass on to our customers immediately or in full all cost increases by increasing our retail sales prices. This, in turn, negatively affects our profit margins. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact of periods of high wholesale product costs on future profit margins. 
 During periods of high wholesale product costs, the prices we charge our customers generally increase. High prices can lead to customer conservation and attrition, resulting in reduced demand for our products. Additionally, in an effort to retain existing accounts and attract new customers we may offer discounts, which will impact the net per gallon gross margin realized. Increases in wholesale product prices may also slow our customer collections as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their bills, leading to higher accounts receivable. 
 If increases in wholesale product costs cause our working capital requirements to exceed the amounts available under our revolving credit facility or should we fail to maintain the required availability or fixed charge coverage ratio, we would not have sufficient working capital to operate our business or cash available for distributions to unitholders. 
 When the wholesale price of home heating oil declines significantly after a customer enters into a price protection arrangement, some customers attempt to renegotiate their arrangement in order to enter into a lower cost pricing plan with us or terminate their arrangement and switch to a competitor, which may adversely impact our gross profit and operating results. 
 13 

If, due to supply constraints or shortages, we cannot purchase sufficient quantities of products to meet our customer s needs, our business and operations will be adversely affected. 
 Constraints in physical product supplies could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products and services in a timely manner, cause an increase in wholesale prices and a decrease in supply, lost sales, customer attrition, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation, and could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. Constraints have been and could be caused by numerous factors including disruption within our supply chain network due to unforeseen events beyond our control. Such disruptions may result from weather-related events; natural disasters; international trade disputes or trade policy changes or restrictions; tariffs or import-related taxes; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shortages of supply chain labor, including truck drivers; shipping capacity constraints, including shortages of related equipment; third-party contract disputes; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; military conflicts; acts of terrorism; public health issues, including pandemics and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by the government; civil unrest; or other factors beyond our control. In addition, constraints in physical product supplies could be caused by s, imbalances in supply and demand of liquid product, exacerbated by geopolitical forces, such as the wars in the Ukraine and in the Middle East. Further, backwardated energy markets, which exist when the current market price of wholesale product is higher than the futures price, have caused and may in the future cause suppliers to reduce physical inventories. We expect to cover a substantial majority of our expected heating oil and propane needs during the heating season for our full service residential and commercial customers with physical supply contracts and inventory on-hand at the beginning of the heating season. The remainder of our customer s needs are satisfied through spot product purchases. During periods when supplies are constrained, we have paid and may continue to pay significant premiums over the wholesale product cost to ensure prompt delivery of spot purchases. In certain cases, these premium payments cannot be passed on to our customers, thereby reducing our profit margins. 
 If service at our third-party terminals, the common carrier pipelines used or the barge companies we hire to move product is interrupted, our operations would be adversely affected. 
 The products that we sell are transported in either barge, pipeline or in truckload quantities to third-party terminals where we have contracts to temporarily store our products. Any significant interruption in the service of these third-party terminals, the common carrier pipelines used or the barge companies that we hire to move product would adversely affect our ability to obtain product. 
 The risk of global terrorism, political unrest and war may adversely affect the economy and the price and availability of the products that we sell and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Terrorist attacks, political unrest and war may adversely impact the price and availability of the products that we sell, our results of operations, our ability to raise debt or equity capital and our future growth. An act of terror could result in disruptions of crude oil supplies, markets and facilities, and the source of the products that we sell could be direct or indirect targets. Terrorist activity may also hinder our ability to transport our products if our normal means of transportation become damaged as a result of an attack. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism could also affect our ability to raise capital. Terrorist activity could likely lead to increased volatility in the prices of our products. 
 Our hedging strategy may adversely affect our liquidity. 
 We purchase derivatives, futures contracts and swaps of diesel fuel primarily from members of our lending group and Cargill in order to mitigate exposure to market risk associated with our inventory and the purchase of home heating oil for price-protected customers. Future positions require an initial cash margin deposit and daily mark-to-market maintenance margin, whereas options are generally paid either upfront or when they expire. Any cash payment reduces our liquidity, as we must pay for the option before any sales are made to the customer. Mark-to-market exposure with our bank group reduces our borrowing base and as such can reduce the amount available to us under our credit agreement. 
 14 

A significant portion of our home heating oil volume is sold to price-protected customers (ceiling and fixed), and our gross margins could be adversely affected if we are not able to effectively hedge against fluctuations in the volume and cost of product sold to these customers. 
 A significant portion of our home heating oil volume is sold to individual customers under arrangements pre-establishing the ceiling sales price or a fixed price of home heating oil over a fixed period. When the customer makes a purchase commitment for the next period, we concurrently purchase option contracts, swaps and futures contracts for diesel fuel covering a substantial majority of the heating oil that we expect to sell to these price-protected customers. The price of heating oil is closely linked to the price of diesel fuel. The amount of home heating oil volume that we hedge per price-protected customer with diesel fuel derivatives is based upon the estimated fuel consumption per average customer, per month by location. If the actual usage exceeds the amount of the hedged volume on a monthly basis, we could be required to obtain additional volume at unfavorable margins. In addition, should actual usage in any month be less than the hedged volume (including, for example, as a result of warm winters and early terminations by price protected customers), we may incur additional hedging costs which reduce our gross profit margins. Currently, we have elected not to designate our derivative instruments as hedging instruments under FASB ASC 815-10-05 Derivatives and Hedging, and the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in our statement of operations. Therefore, we experience volatility in earnings as these currently outstanding derivative contracts are marked-to-market and non-cash gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations. 
 Our risk management policies cannot eliminate all commodity price risk or the impact of adverse market conditions which can adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. In addition, any noncompliance with our risk management policies could result in significant financial losses. 
 While our hedging policies are designed to minimize commodity risk, some degree of exposure to unforeseen fluctuations in market conditions remains. For example, we change our hedged position daily in response to movements in our inventory. Any difference between the estimated future sales from inventory and actual sales will create a mismatch between the amount of inventory and the hedges against that inventory, and thus change the commodity risk position that we are trying to maintain. We monitor processes and procedures to reduce the risk of unauthorized trading and to maintain substantial balance between purchases and sales or future delivery obligations. We can provide no assurance, however, that these steps will detect and/or prevent all violations of such risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved. 
 We rely on the continued solvency of our wholesale product suppliers and derivatives, insurance and weather hedge counterparties. 
 If one of our wholesale product suppliers were to fail, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted, as we may be required to purchase product from other sources which may be at higher prices than we were prepared to pay. If counterparties to the derivative instruments that we use to hedge the cost of home heating oil sold to price-protected customers, physical inventory and our vehicle fuel costs were to fail, our liquidity, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted, as we would be obligated to fulfill our operational requirement of purchasing, storing and selling home heating oil and vehicle fuel, while losing the mitigating benefits of economic hedges with a failed counterparty. If one of our insurance carriers were to fail, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted, as we would have to fund any catastrophic loss. If our weather hedge counterparties were to fail, we would lose the protection of our weather hedge contract. 
 Risks Related to Customer Attrition, Competition, and Demand for Our Products 
 Our operating results will be adversely affected if we continue to experience significant net customer attrition in our home heating oil and propane customer base. 
 The following table depicts our gross customer gains, losses and net attrition from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2024. Net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through marketing efforts. Customers added through acquisitions are not included in the calculation of gross customer gains. However, additional customer gains that are obtained through marketing efforts or lost at newly acquired businesses are included in these calculations from the point of closing going forward. Customer attrition percentage

calculations include customers added through acquisitions in the denominators of the calculations on a weighted average basis from the closing date.

The gain of a new customer does not fully compensate for the loss of an existing customer because of the expenses incurred during the first year to add a new customer. Typically, the per gallon margin realized from a new account added is less than the margin of a customer that switches to another provider. Customer losses are the result of various factors, including but not limited to, wholesale product price volatility, price competition, warmer than normal weather, customer relocations and home sales/foreclosures, credit worthiness, service disruptions, and conversions to natural gas and electricity. 
 Periods of high wholesale product costs due to energy market volatility and inflation have added to our difficulty in reducing net customer attrition. Warmer than normal weather has also contributed to an increase in attrition as customers perceive less need for a full-service provider like ourselves. 
 A substantial majority of the Company s price-protected customers have agreements with us that are subject to annual renewal in the period between April and November of each fiscal year. If a significant number of these customers elect not to renew their price-protected agreements with us and do not continue as our customers under a variable price-plan, this will adversely impact our net customer attrition and, consequently, the Company s near term profitability, liquidity and cash flow. 
 If we are not able to reduce the current level of net customer attrition or if such level should increase, attrition will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and cash available for distributions to unitholders. For additional information about customer attrition, see Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Customer Attrition. 
 Because of the highly competitive nature of our business, we may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which would have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Our business is subject to substantial competition. Most of our operating locations compete with numerous distributors, primarily on the basis of price, reliability of service and responsiveness to customer service needs. Each operating location operates in its own competitive environment. 
 We compete with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full-service distributors, such as ourselves, to those offering delivery only. As do many companies in our business, we provide home heating equipment repair service on a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week, 52 weeks a year basis. We believe that this tends to build customer loyalty. In some instances, homeowners have formed buying cooperatives that seek to purchase home heating oil from distributors at a price lower than individual customers are otherwise able to obtain. We also compete for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products, principally natural gas, propane (in the case of our home heating oil operations) and electricity. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose existing customers and/or fail to acquire new customers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Energy efficiency and new technology may reduce the demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results. 
 Increased conservation and technological advances, including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient furnaces and other heating devices, such as electric heat pumps, have adversely affected the demand for our products by retail customers. Future conservation measures or technological advances in heating, conservation, energy generation or other devices might reduce demand and adversely affect our operating results. 
 16 

Our operating results will be adversely affected if we experience significant net customer attrition from conversions to alternative energy products, principally natural gas or electricity. 
 The following table depicts our estimated customer losses to natural gas and electricity conversions for the last five fiscal years. Losses to natural gas and electricity in our footprint for the home heating oil industry could be greater or less than our estimates.

In addition to our direct customer losses to natural gas and electricity competition, any conversion to natural gas or electricity by a heating oil consumer in our geographic footprint reduces the pool of available customers from which we can gain new heating oil customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 If we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, we will not be able to replace or grow our declining customer base. 
 Generally, heating oil and propane are secondary energy choices for new housing construction, because natural gas is usually selected when the infrastructure exists. In certain areas in our operating footprint, state and local legislatures are mandating using electricity in new building construction, thus displacing heating systems using fossil fuels, such as heating oil and propane. As such, our industry is declining. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or grow our customer base will depend on our ability to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. We cannot assure that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates in the future or that we will be able to acquire businesses on economically acceptable terms. Adverse operating and financial results may limit our access to capital and adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions. 
 Our acquisition activities could result in operational difficulties, unrecoverable costs and other negative consequences, any of which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Any acquisition may involve potential risks to us and ultimately to our unitholders, including an increase in our indebtedness, an increase in our working capital requirements, an inability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, an excess of customer loss from the acquired business, loss of key employees from the acquired business and the assumption of additional liabilities, including environmental liabilities . 
 Since weather conditions may adversely affect the demand for home heating oil and propane, our business, operating results and financial condition are vulnerable to warm winters. 
 Weather conditions in regions in which we operate have a significant impact on the demand for home heating oil and propane because our customers depend on this product largely for space heating purposes. As a result, weather conditions may materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. During the peak-heating season of October through March, sales of home heating oil and propane historically have represented approximately 80 of our annual volume sold. Actual weather conditions can vary substantially from year to year or from month to month, significantly affecting our financial performance. Climate change may result in increased weather volatility. See We face possible risks and costs associated with the effects of changes in climate and severe weather in these Risk Factors. Warmer than normal temperatures in one or more regions in which we operate can significantly decrease the total volume we sell and the gross profit realized and, consequently, our results of operations. 
 To partially mitigate the adverse effect of warm weather on cash flows, we have used weather hedge contracts for a number of years. In general, such weather hedge contracts provide that we are entitled to receive a specific payment per heating degree-day shortfall, when the total number of heating degree-days in the hedge period is less than the ten year average. The payment thresholds, or strikes, are set at various levels. The hedge period runs from November 1, through March 31, of a fiscal year taken as a whole. Although we have entered into weather hedges for fiscal 2025 and in prior years' periods, there can be no assurance that weather hedge contracts on historical terms and prices will continue to be available past fiscal 2025. There can be no assurance that our weather hedge contracts, 
 17 

if any, will fully or substantially offset the adverse effects of warmer weather on our business and operating results or that colder weather will result in enough profit to offset our hedging costs. 
 Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. 
 Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations since the demand for home heating oil and propane is greater during the first and second fiscal quarter of our fiscal year, which is the peak heating season. The seasonal nature of our business has resulted on average in the last five years in the sale of approximately 30 of our volume of home heating oil and propane in the first fiscal quarter and 50 of our volume in the second fiscal quarter of each fiscal year. As a result, we generally realize net income in our first and second fiscal quarters and net losses during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and we expect that the negative impact of seasonality on our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results will continue. Thus, any material reduction in the profitability of the first and second quarters for any reason, including warmer than normal weather and wholesale product price volatility, generally cannot be made up by any significant profitability improvements in the results of the third and fourth quarters. 
 We face possible risks and costs associated with effects of changes in climate and severe weather. 
 We cannot predict changes in climate. The physical effects of changes in climate could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Since weather conditions may adversely affect the demand for home heating oil and propane, our business, operating results and financial condition are vulnerable to warm winters. To the extent that changes in climate impact weather patterns, our markets could experience severe weather. If the frequency or magnitude of severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, blizzards or earthquakes increase, as a result of changes in climate or for other reasons, our results of operations and our financial performance could be negatively impacted by the extent of damage to our facilities or to our customers residential homes and business structures, or of disruption to the supply or delivery of the products we sell . 
 Risks Related to Regulatory and Environmental Matters - See also Item 1 Business Government Regulations 
 Federal, state and local legislation in response to climate change has the potential to adversely impact the Company s operations and reduce demand for our products and services. 
 There is increasing attention in the United States and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gas GHG emissions, from the combustion of carbon-based fossil fuels. Our heating oil and propane products are widely considered to be fossil fuels that produce GHG emissions. To combat the cause of global warming domestically, President Biden identified climate change as one of his administration s top priorities and pledged to seek measures that would pave the path for the U.S. to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act which aims to reduce GHG emissions by offering tax and other incentives desired to encourage homeowners to switch to alternative sources of energy than the ones we sell. In addition, the State of New York, where a majority of our operations are located, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut and certain municipalities in our operating footprint have adopted laws, regulations and policies addressing climate change and restricting GHG emissions from fossil fuel burning systems. For additional information about climate change regulations affecting us, See Item 1 Business Government Regulations for a summary of certain laws, regulations and policies adopted by states and municipalities in our operating footprint addressing climate change and/or restricting GHG emissions from fossil-fuel burning systems. The federal, state and local climate change regulatory landscape is highly complex and rapidly and continuously evolving. At this time, we cannot predict whether, when, which, or in what form climate change legislation provisions and GHG emission restrictions may be enacted and what the impact of any such legislation or standards may have on our business, financial conditions or operations in the future. These measures could have a negative impact on our business over time or in the future. 
 Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by environmental regulations, and regulatory costs. 
 Our business is subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations related to environmental and other matters. Such laws and regulations have become increasingly stringent over time. We may experience increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from noncompliance with operating or other regulatory permits. New regulations, such as those relating to underground storage, 
 18 

transportation, and delivery of the products that we sell, might adversely impact operations or make them more costly. In addition, there are environmental risks inherently associated with home heating oil operations, such as the risks of accidental releases or spills. We have incurred and continue to incur costs to remediate soil and groundwater contamination at some of our locations. We cannot be sure that we have identified all such contamination, that we know the full extent of our obligations with respect to contamination of which we are aware, or that we will not become responsible for additional contamination not yet discovered. It is possible that material costs and liabilities will be incurred, including those relating to claims for damages to property and persons and the environment. For additional information about environmental and other regulations we are subject to, see Item 1 Business-Governmental Regulations. 
 Changes in tax laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. Changes to existing tax laws or the enactment of future reform legislation could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders. 
 
 Risks Related to Information Technology and Cybersecurity 
 We depend on the use of information technology systems that have been and may in the future be a target of cyber-attacks. 
 We rely on multiple information technology systems and networks that are maintained internally and by third-party vendors, and failure or breach of these systems could significantly impede operations. In addition, our systems and networks, as well as those of our vendors, banks and counterparties, may receive and store personal or proprietary information in connection with human resources operations, customer offerings, and other aspects of our business. A cyber-attack or material network breach in the security of these systems could include the exfiltration, or other unauthorized access or disclosure, of proprietary information or employee and customer information, as well as disrupt our operations or damage our information technology infrastructure or those of third parties. 
 For example, in July 2021, we detected a security incident that resulted in the encryption of certain of our information technology systems. Promptly upon discovery of the incident, we launched an investigation with the assistance of an outside cybersecurity firm, notified law enforcement, and took steps to address the incident and restore full operations. As a result of our investigation of the incident, we do not believe any personal information belonging to customers was involved. However, we believe that an unauthorized third party exfiltrated and/or accessed certain employee personal identifying information PII and/or protected health information PHI relating to employee health insurance plans and human resources information, residing on some of the affected systems. We were able to continue to serve our customers without interruption. We do not believe that this incident had a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results. However, we cannot be certain that that similar cyber-attacks will not occur in the future. Any future cyber-attacks or incidents may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results. 
 It is our view that cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, and sophistication and intensity. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to disrupt, information technology systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement security measures that would prevent them. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. In addition, the information technology controls or legacy third party providers of an acquired business may be inadequate to prevent a future cyber-attack, unauthorized access or other data security breaches. If another cyber-attack were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and increase our operating and capital costs, which could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution. To the extent that a future cyber-attack, security breach or other such disruption results in a loss or damage to the Company s data, or the disclosure of PII, PHI or other personal or proprietary information, including customer or employee information, it could cause significant damage to the Company s reputation, affect relationships with its customers, vendors and employees, lead to claims against the Company, and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs to mitigate, remediate and protect against 
 19 

damage caused by cyber-attacks, security breaches or other such disruptions in the future. We have paid and may continue to pay significantly higher insurance premiums to maintain cyber insurance coverage, and even if we are able to maintain cyber insurance coverage, it may not be sufficient in amounts and scope to cover all harm sustained by the Company in any future cyber-attack or other data security incident. For more information on management's risk management, strategy, governance and impacts from cybersecurity incidents, see Item 1C. Cybersecurity. 
 Risks Related to Our Workforce 
 Our inability to identify, hire and retain qualified individuals for our workforce could slow our growth and adversely impact our ability to operate our business. 
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees to meet the needs of our business. We have experienced and may continue to experience shortages of qualified individuals to fill available positions. We place a heavy emphasis on the qualification and training of our personnel and spend a significant amount of time and money on training our team members. Any inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may result in higher turnover and increased labor costs, could compromise the quality of our service, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A substantial portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor actions that could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs and adversely affect our business. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 39 of our employees were covered under 62 different collective bargaining agreements. As a result, we are usually involved in union negotiations with several local bargaining units at any given time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of any expired or expiring agreement on terms satisfactory to us. Although we consider our relations with our employees to be generally satisfactory, we may experience strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns in the future. If our unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, our non-union employees may become subject to labor organizing efforts. If any of our current non-union facilities were to unionize, we could incur increased risk of work stoppages and potentially higher labor costs. 
 Our obligation to fund multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us. 
 We participate in a number of multi-employer pension plans for current and former union employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. The risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans in that assets contributed are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other participating employers. Several factors could require us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including the funding status of the plan, unfavorable investment performance, insolvency or withdrawal of participating employers, changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants. Several of these multi-employer plans to which we contribute are underfunded, meaning that the value of such plans assets are less than the actuarial value of the plans benefit obligations. 
 We may be subject to additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of our participation in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. Various Federal laws impose certain liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multi-employer pension plan if the employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal, potentially including an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not just our retirees. Accordingly, we could be assessed our share of unfunded liabilities should we terminate participation in these plans, or should there be a mass withdrawal from these plans, or if the plans become insolvent or otherwise terminate.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Units 
 Conflicts of interest have arisen and could arise in the future. 
 Conflicts of interest have arisen and could arise in the future as a result of relationships between the general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or any of our limited partners, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, the general partner may favor its own interests and those of its affiliates over the interests of the unitholders. The nature of these conflicts is ongoing and includes the following considerations: 
 The general partner s affiliates are not prohibited from engaging in other business or activities, including direct competition with us. 

The general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, capital expenditures, distributions to unitholders, unit repurchases, and our capital structure, each of which can impact the amount of cash, if any, available for distribution to unitholders, and available to pay principal and interest on debt and the amount of incentive distributions payable in respect of the general partner units. 

The general partner decides whether to retain its counsel or engage separate counsel to perform services for us. 

Unitholders are deemed to have consented to some actions and conflicts of interest under the Partnership Agreement that might otherwise be deemed a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law. 

Under the Partnership Agreement, the general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties in addition to the Company in resolving conflicts of interest, thereby limiting its fiduciary duty to the unitholders. 

The general partner determines whether to issue additional units or other of our securities. 

The general partner is not restricted from causing us to pay the general partner or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf. 

Cash distributions (if any) are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with performance and reserve requirements. 
 Distributions of available cash, if any, by us to unitholders will depend on the amount of cash generated, and distributions may fluctuate based on our performance. The actual amount of cash that is available for distribution will depend upon numerous factors, many of which are out of our control. 
 Our credit agreement imposes restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to unitholders, including the need to maintain certain covenants. (See the credit agreement at Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings). 
 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, then we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common units. 
 Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. We may experience difficulties in implementing effective internal controls as part of our integration of acquisitions from private companies, which are not subject to the internal control requirements imposed on public companies. If we are unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or if the businesses we acquire have ineffective internal controls, our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls over financial reporting could cause our unitholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units. 
 21 

Our unitholder rights plan may discourage potential acquirers of the Company . 
 In March 2023, we adopted a unitholder rights plan, which provides, among other things, that when specified events occur, our unitholders will be entitled to purchase additional common units. The unitholders rights plan will expire on March 24, 2028, unless further extended. The common unit purchase rights are triggered ten days after the date of a public announcement that a person or group acting in concert has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15 or more of our outstanding common units. The common unit purchase rights would cause significant dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms that are not approved by the board of directors of the general partner. These provisions, either alone or in combination with each other, give our general partner a substantial ability to influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the Company. These provisions would apply even if an acquisition or other significant corporate transaction was considered beneficial by some of our unitholders. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 Our substantial debt and other financial obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to obtain additional financing and have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to meet our financial and other obligations. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding under our seventh amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement a 210.0 million term loan, less than 0.1 million under the revolver portion of the agreement, 5.2 million of letters of credit, 14.2 million hedge positions were secured under the credit agreement and our availability was 166.5 million. (See the credit agreement at Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings). Our debt is often substantially higher during the heating season as we access our revolving credit facilities to finance accounts receivable and inventory balances. For example, our borrowings under the revolver peaked at 79.6 million during the fiscal 2024 heating season. Our substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations could: 
 impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, unit repurchases, paying distributions or general partnership purposes; 

have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with financial and affirmative and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and an event of default occurs that is not cured or waived; 

expose us to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; 

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and 

If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and other financial obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness and other financial transactions, seek additional equity capital or sell our assets. We might then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell our assets on satisfactory terms, if at all. 
 We are not required to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting our future obligations to our lenders, which may limit the cash available to service the final payment due on the term loan outstanding under our credit agreement. 
 Subject to the limitations on restricted payments that are contained in our credit agreement, we are not required to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting our future obligations to our lenders. As a result, we may be required to refinance the final payment of our term loan, which is expected to be 110.3 million. Our ability to refinance the term loan will depend upon our future results of operation and financial condition as well as developments in the capital markets. Our general partner will determine the future use of our cash resources and has broad discretion in determining such uses and in establishing reserves for such uses, which may include but are not limited to, providing for distributions of cash to our unitholders in accordance with the requirements of our Partnership Agreement, providing for future capital expenditures and other payments deemed by our general partner to be necessary or advisable, including to make acquisitions, and repurchasing common units. Depending on the 
 22 

timing and amount of our use of cash, this could significantly reduce the cash available to us in subsequent periods to make payments on borrowings under our credit agreement. 
 Restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may reduce our operating flexibility. 
 Our credit agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, make distributions to our unitholders, purchase or redeem our outstanding equity interests, sell assets, and engage in other lines of business. 
 These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. Our credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions can be affected by events beyond our control, such as weather conditions and general economic conditions. Accordingly, we may be unable to meet those ratios and conditions. 
 Any breach of any of these covenants, failure to meet any of these ratios or conditions, or occurrence of a change of control would result in a default under the terms of the credit agreement and cause the amounts borrowed to become immediately due and payable. If the lenders of our indebtedness or other financial obligations accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding or proceed against the collateral, if any. 
 General Risk Factors 
 We are subject to operating and litigation risks that could adversely affect our operating results whether or not covered by insurance. 
 Our operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing, transporting and otherwise providing customers with our products such as natural disasters, adverse weather, accidents, fires, explosions, hazardous material releases, mechanical failures and other events beyond our control. If any of these events were to occur, we could incur substantial losses because of personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage resulting in curtailment or suspension of our related operations. As a result, we may be a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. 
 As we self-insure workers compensation, automobile, general liability and medical claims up to pre-established limits, we establish reserves based upon expectations as to what our ultimate liability will be for claims based on our historical factors. Periodically, we evaluate on the potential for changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries. 
 Other than matters for which we self-insure, we maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. However, there can be no assurance that the ultimate settlement of these claims will not differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate the reserves or that the insurance we maintain will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims. 
 Recessionary economic conditions and rapid inflation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, unemployment rates, rising health care costs, energy availability and costs, the negative impacts caused by global conflicts, pandemics and public health crises, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions, including rapid increases in inflation, have impacted, and may again impact, our business and operations in a variety of ways. Uncertainty about economic conditions poses a risk as our customers may reduce or postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material 
 23 

negative effect on the demand for our products and services and could lead to increased conservation, as we have seen certain of our customers seek lower cost providers. In addition, recessionary economic conditions could negatively impact the spending and financial viability of our customers. As a result, we could experience an increase in bad debts from financially distressed customers, which would have a negative effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition . 
 ITEM 1B. 	 UNRESOLVE D STAFF COMMENTS 
 Not applicable. 
 ITEM 1C. 	 CYBER SECURITY 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 We have implemented a comprehensive information security program to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. This program includes policies and procedures that guide the development, implementation, and maintenance of security measures and controls. We utilize industry-standard metrics to evaluate the criticality of software, data assets, and operational technology. Our cybersecurity efforts align with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, with annual assessments to ensure compliance . 
 Given our reliance on third-party software, service providers, and applications to support various business functions and security measures, we regularly conduct security audits and vendor management reviews. These processes are intended to ensure that third-party systems and services comply with our cybersecurity program . 
 Periodic cyber risk assessments of our operational technology network help us identify risks, which we address using risk-based analysis and judgment. We also conduct internal and external testing of software, hardware, and defensive systems in our efforts to uncover potential vulnerabilities. Third-party security firms are employed for certain controls and technology operations, including vulnerability scans and penetration testing. Our approach to managing third-party cybersecurity threats includes pre-acquisition due diligence, contractual obligations, and ongoing performance monitoring. 
 We employ governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) tools to manage cybersecurity risks and maintain business continuity and disaster recovery plans to prepare for potential disruptions. Our employees receive cybersecurity awareness training upon hiring, with additional training provided on a regular basis. 
 Governance 
 The Vice President of Information Technology (IT) and the Director of IT Security are responsible for overseeing our cybersecurity risk management program. This includes managing internal cybersecurity staff, consulting with external cybersecurity experts, and staying informed through governmental and private sources. They report regularly to executive management on cybersecurity threats, resources, and program updates. 
 Cybersecurity risk management is integrated into our overall risk management processes. The program monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity risks and incidents. The Vice President of IT presents updates on IT projects, including cybersecurity policies and programs, to executive management at least quarterly. 
 The Board of Directors has overall oversight of key risks, with strategic oversight of cybersecurity risk management delegated to the Audit Committee. Annually, the Audit Committee reviews the Company s enterprise risk management, which includes cybersecurity. In fiscal year 2024, the Audit Committee established an IT Audit Subcommittee to enhance focus on IT-related internal controls and cybersecurity. The Board and Audit Committee have appointed one of its independent directors and members of the Audit Committee to sit on the IT Subcommittee. This subcommittee meets quarterly with key company leaders to review cybersecurity risks and audit findings and reports regularly to the Audit Committee.

Impacts from Cybersecurity Threats 
 Although we have experienced cybersecurity incidents, we do not believe they have, or are likely to have, a material impact on the business. However, we recognize that cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, and future incidents remain a possibility. Despite our security measures and IT controls, we cannot guarantee that future cybersecurity incidents will be prevented. A successful attack could have significant consequences for the business. For more information on the risks associated with cybersecurity threats, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 ITEM 2. 	 PR O PERTIES 
 We currently provide services to our customers in the United States in twelve states and the District of Columbia, ranging from Massachusetts to Maryland from 41 principal operating locations and 82 depots, 53 of which are owned and 70 of which are leased. As of September 30, 2024, we had a fleet of approximately 1,134 truck and transport vehicles, the majority of which were owned, 1,195 service and 384 support vehicles, the majority of which were leased. Our obligations under our credit agreement are secured by liens and mortgages on substantially all of the Company s and subsidiaries real and personal property.

As of November 30, 2024, there were approximately 185 holders of record of common units. 
 There is no established public trading market for the Company s 0.3 million general partner units. 
 Distribution Provisions 
 We are required to make distributions in an amount equal to our Available Cash, as defined in our Partnership Agreement, no more than 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, to holders of record on the applicable record dates. Available Cash, as defined in our Partnership Agreement, generally means all cash on hand at the end of the relevant fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the Board of Directors of our general partner in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements. These reserves are established for the proper conduct of our business (including reserves for future capital expenditures) for minimum quarterly distributions during the next four quarters and to comply with applicable laws and the terms of any debt agreements or other agreement to which we are subject. The Board of Directors of our general partner reviews the level of Available Cash each quarter based upon information provided by management. 
 According to the terms of our Partnership Agreement, minimum quarterly distributions on the common units accrue at the rate of 0.0675 per quarter 0.27 on an annual basis). The information concerning restrictions on distributions required by Item 5 of this Report is incorporated by reference to Note 4 to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements - Quarterly Distribution of Available Cash. The credit agreement imposes certain restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to unitholders. In order to pay any distributions to unitholders or repurchase Common Units, the Company must maintain Availability (as defined in the credit agreement) not less than the greater of 15 of the Line Cap (lesser of the revolving credit facility borrowings and the borrowing base) and 40 million, on a historical pro forma and forward-looking basis, and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.15 after giving pro forma effect to such distributions as if such distributions were paid on the first day of the relevant period. (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings). 
 On October 17, 2024, we declared a quarterly distribution of 0.1725 per unit, or 0.69 per unit on an annualized basis, on all Common Units with respect to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, paid on November 6, 2024, to holders of record on October 28, 2024. The amount of distributions in excess of the minimum quarterly distribution of 0.0675, were distributed in accordance with our Partnership Agreement, subject to management incentive compensation plan. As a result, 6.0 million was paid to the Common Unit holders, 0.4 million to the general partner unit holders (including 0.3 million of incentive distribution as provided in our Partnership Agreement) and 0.3 million to management pursuant to the management incentive compensation plan which provides for certain members of management to receive incentive distributions that would otherwise be payable to the General Partner.

 Liquid Product Price Volatility 
 Volatility, which is reflected in the wholesale price of liquid products, including home heating oil, propane and motor fuels, has a larger impact on our business when prices rise. Home heating oil consumers are sensitive to heating cost increases, and this often leads to customer conservation and increased gross customer losses. As a commodity, the price of home heating oil is generally impacted by many factors, including economic and geopolitical forces and is closely linked to the price of diesel fuel. The volatility in the wholesale cost of diesel fuel as measured by the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX ), for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2020, through 2024, on a quarterly basis, is illustrated in the following chart (price per gallon):

Income Taxes 
 Book versus Tax Deductions 
 The amount of cash flow generated in any given year depends upon a variety of factors including the amount of cash income taxes required, which will increase as depreciation and amortization decreases. The amount of 
 28 

depreciation and amortization that we deduct for book (i.e., financial reporting) purposes will differ from the amount that the Company can deduct for Federal tax purposes. The table below compares the estimated depreciation and amortization for book purposes to the amount that we expect to deduct for Federal tax purposes, based on currently owned assets. While we file our tax returns based on a calendar year, the amounts below are based on our September 30 fiscal year, and the tax amounts include any bonus depreciation available for fixed assets purchased. However, this table does not include any forecast of future annual capital purchases.

Weather Hedge Contracts 
 Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for home heating oil and propane because certain customers depend on these products principally for space heating purposes. Actual weather conditions may vary substantially from year to year, significantly affecting the Company s financial performance. To partially mitigate the adverse effect of warm weather on cash flow, we have used weather hedging contracts for a number of years with several providers. 
 The Company entered into weather hedge contracts for fiscal years 2023 and 2024. The hedge period runs from November 1 through March 31, taken as a whole. The Payment Thresholds, or strikes, are set at various levels and are referenced against degree days for the prior ten year average. Under these contracts the maximum amount the Company can receive is 12.5 million annually. For the contracts applicable to fiscal 2023, we were additionally obligated to make an annual payment capped at 5.0 million if degree days exceeded the Payment Threshold. This obligation does not exist under the contract applicable to fiscal year 2024. 
 The temperatures experienced during the hedge period through March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were warmer than the strikes in the weather hedge contracts. As a result for fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Company reduced delivery and branch expenses for the gains realized under those contracts of 7.5 million and 12.5 million, respectively. The amounts were received in full in April 2024 and April 2023, respectively. 
 For fiscal 2025, the Company entered into weather hedge contracts with the similar hedge period described above. The maximum that the Company can receive is 15.0 million annually and we are additionally obligated to make an annual payment capped at 5.0 million if degree days exceed the Payment Threshold. If we had this same amount of coverage in place during fiscal 2024 we would have received 7.5 million more in April 2024. 
 Per Gallon Gross Profit Margins 
 We believe home heating oil and propane margins should be evaluated on a cents per gallon basis (before the effects of increases or decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments), as we believe that such per gallon margins are best at showing profit trends in the underlying business, without the impact of non-cash changes in the market value of hedges before the settlement of the underlying transaction. 
 A significant portion of our home heating oil volume is sold to individual customers under an arrangement pre-establishing a ceiling price or fixed price for home heating oil over a set period of time, generally twelve to twenty-four months price-protected customers). When these price-protected customers agree to purchase home heating oil from us for the next heating season, we purchase option contracts, swaps and futures contracts for a substantial majority of the heating oil that we expect to sell to these customers. The amount of home heating oil volume that we hedge per price-protected customer is based upon the estimated fuel consumption per average customer per month. In the event that the actual usage exceeds the amount of the hedged volume on a monthly basis, we may be required to obtain additional volume at unfavorable costs. In addition, should actual usage in any month be less than the hedged volume, our hedging costs and losses could be greater, thus reducing expected margins. 
 29 

Derivatives 
 FASB ASC 815-10-05 Derivatives and Hedging requires that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. We follow hedge accounting for our interest rate swaps, but we have opted out of, and do not follow hedge accounting for our commodity derivative instruments as hedging instruments. Regarding our interest rate hedges, to the extent our interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are effective, as defined under this guidance, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the forecasted hedged item is recognized in earnings. As mentioned, we have elected not to designate our commodity derivative instruments as hedging instruments under this guidance and, as a result, the changes in fair value of the commodity derivative instruments are recognized in our statement of operations. Therefore, we experience volatility in earnings as outstanding derivative instruments are marked-to-market and non-cash gains and losses are recorded prior to the sale of the commodity to the customer. The volatility in any given period related to unrealized non-cash gains or losses on derivative instruments can be significant to our overall results. However, we ultimately expect those gains and losses to be offset by the cost of product when purchased. 
 Customer Attrition 
 We measure net customer attrition on an ongoing basis for our full service residential and commercial home heating oil and propane customers. Net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through marketing efforts. Customers added through acquisitions are not included in the calculation of gross customer gains. However, additional customers that are obtained through marketing efforts or lost at newly acquired businesses are included in these calculations from the point of closing going forward. Customer attrition percentage calculations include customers added through acquisitions in the denominators of the calculations on a weighted average basis from the closing date. Gross customer losses are the result of a number of factors, including price competition, move-outs, credit losses, conversions to natural gas and service disruptions. When a customer moves out of an existing home, we count the move out as a loss, and if we are successful in signing up the new homeowner, the move in is treated as a gain. The impact of certain geopolitical forces on liquid product prices could increase future attrition due to higher losses from credit related issues.

For fiscal 2024, the Company lost 16,600 accounts (net), or 4.2 , of its home heating oil and propane customer base, compared to 14,800 accounts lost (net), or 3.6 , of its home heating oil and propane customer base, during fiscal 2023. Gross customer gains were 11,000 accounts lower than the prior year s comparable period primarily due to market conditions with regard to physical supply in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 that did not repeat in the current fiscal year and less customer move-ins. Gross customer losses were 9,200 accounts lower primarily due to reduction in the number of customer relocations and other factors. 
 For fiscal 2023, the Company lost 14,800 accounts (net), or 3.6 , of its home heating oil and propane customer base, compared to 15,600 accounts lost (net), or 3.7 , of its home heating oil and propane customer base, during fiscal 2022. Gross customer gains were 300 accounts lower than the prior year s comparable period, and gross customer losses were 1,100 accounts lower primarily due to reduction in the number of customer relocations. 
 During fiscal 2024, we estimate that we lost (1.4 of our home heating oil and propane accounts to natural gas and electricity conversions versus (1.6 for fiscal 2023 and (1.5 for fiscal 2022. Losses to natural gas and electricity in our footprint for the heating oil and propane industry could be greater or less than the Company s estimates. 
 Acquisitions 
 The timing of acquisitions and the types of products sold by acquired companies impact year-over-year comparisons. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 the Company acquired a heating oil business for approximately 0.7 million. During fiscal 2024, the Company acquired one propane and four heating oil businesses for approximately 49.4 million. During fiscal 2023, the Company acquired two heating oil businesses and one propane business for approximately 19.8 million. The following tables detail the Company s acquisition activity and the associated volume sold during the 12-month period prior to the date of acquisition.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 The following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial and operating data and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 32 

Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024 
 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 
 Volume 
 For fiscal 2024, the retail volume of home heating oil and propane sold decreased by 5.8 million gallons, or 2.2 , to 253.4 million gallons, compared to 259.2 million gallons for fiscal 2023. For those locations where we had existing operations during both periods, which we sometimes refer to as the base business (i.e., excluding acquisitions), temperatures (measured on a heating degree day basis) for fiscal 2024 were less than 0.1 warmer than fiscal 2023 and 15.1 warmer than normal, as reported by NOAA. For fiscal 2024, net customer attrition for the base business was 4.2 . The impact of fuel conservation, along with any period-to-period differences in delivery scheduling, the timing of accounts added or lost during the fiscal years, equipment efficiency, and other volume variances not otherwise described, are included in the chart below under the heading Other. An analysis of the change in the retail volume of home heating oil and propane, which is based on management s estimates, sampling, and other mathematical calculations and certain assumptions, is found below:

Volume of motor fuel and other petroleum products sold decreased by 9.9 million gallons, or 7.1 , to 129.1 million gallons for fiscal 2024, compared to 139.0 million gallons for fiscal 2023. 
 Product Sales 
 For fiscal 2024, product sales decreased 201.9 million, or 12.2 , to 1,448.8 million, compared to 1,650.7 million in fiscal 2023, due to a decrease in average selling prices and a decrease in total volume sold of 3.9 . Selling prices decreased largely due to a decrease in wholesale product cost of 0.4602 per gallon, or 15.2 . Product volumes and wholesale product cost include heating oil, propane, motor fuels and other petroleum products. 
 Installations and Services Sales 
 For fiscal 2024, installation and service sales increased 15.2 million, or 5.0 , to 317.3 million, compared to 302.1 million for fiscal 2023. Installation sales increased by 8.8 million, or 7.6 , and service sales increased by 6.4 million, or 3.4 . The increase was partially driven by 5.2 million of sales generated from recent acquisitions, and the remainder was driven by a concerted effort to expand these offerings to our customers as well as annual price increases. 
 33 

Cost of Product 
 For fiscal 2024, cost of product decreased 223.4 million, or 18.5 , to 980.8 million, compared to 1,204.2 million for fiscal 2023, due to a decrease in wholesale product cost of 0.4602 per gallon, or 15.2 and a decrease in total volume sold of 3.9 . Product volumes and wholesale product cost include heating oil, propane, motor fuels and other petroleum products. 
 Gross Profit Product 
 The table below calculates our per gallon margins and reconciles product gross profit for home heating oil and propane and motor fuel and other petroleum products. We believe the change in home heating oil and propane margins should be evaluated before the effects of increases or decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments, as we believe that realized per gallon margins should not include the impact of non-cash changes in the market value of hedges before the settlement of the underlying transaction. On that basis, home heating oil and propane margins for fiscal 2024 increased by 0.1304 per gallon, or 8.4 , to 1.6800 per gallon, from 1.5496 per gallon during fiscal 2023. We cannot assume that the per gallon margins realized during fiscal 2024 are sustainable for future periods. Product sales and cost of product include home heating oil, propane, motor fuel, other petroleum products and liquidated damages billings.

For fiscal 2024, total product gross profit was 468.0 million, which was 21.5 million, or 4.8 , higher than fiscal 2023, due to an increase in home heating oil and propane margins 33.2 million) that was partially offset by a decrease in home heating oil and propane volume sold 9.0 million) and decrease in gross profit from other petroleum products 2.7 million). 
 Cost of Installations and Services 
 Total installation costs for fiscal 2024 increased by 5.7 million or 6.0 , to 100.9 million, compared to 95.2 million of installation costs for fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher installation revenues of 8.8 million. Installation costs as a percentage of installation sales were 81.7 for fiscal 2024 and 83.0 for fiscal 2023. Gross profit from installations increased by 3.0 million due to an increase in sales dollars and an improvement in the gross profit margin realized on installation sales. 
 Service expense decreased by 0.2 million, or 0.1 , to 182.5 million for fiscal 2024, representing 94.2 of service sales, versus 182.7 million, or 97.5 of service sales, for fiscal 2023. While service revenues increased by 6.4 million, service costs decreased by 0.3 million which led to an increase in gross profit from service of 6.7 
 34 

million. In fiscal 2024, the company undertook certain steps to improve service performance which favorably impacted service costs when compared to fiscal 2023. In addition, a large proportion of our service expenses are incurred under fixed-fee prepaid service contract arrangements, therefore trends in service expenses may not directly correlate to trends in the related revenues especially given the warmer than normal weather conditions in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. In both fiscal 2024 and 2023, the demand for service was less than expected due to the warmer than normal weather conditions. 
 We realized a combined gross profit from services and installations of 33.9 million for fiscal 2024 compared to a combined gross profit of 24.2 million for fiscal 2023, a 9.7 million increase in profitability. 
 (Increase) Decrease in the Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 
 During fiscal 2024, the change in the fair value of derivative instruments resulted in a 19.0 million charge due to a decrease in the market value for unexpired hedges (a 14.6 million charge) and a 4.4 million charge due to the expiration of certain hedged positions. 
 During fiscal 2023, the change in the fair value of derivative instruments resulted in a 2.0 million charge as an increase in the market value for unexpired hedges (a 3.9 million credit) was more than offset by a 5.9 million charge due to the expiration of certain hedged positions. 
 Delivery and Branch Expenses 
 For fiscal 2024, delivery and branch expenses increased 12.8 million to 366.4 million, compared to 353.6 million for fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2024, the company recorded a benefit under the weather hedge of 7.5 million compared to a benefit of 12.5 million during fiscal 2023 that accounts for a 5.0 million increase in expense. The increase was also driven by 6.4 million of expenses from recent acquisitions and a 1.4 million, or 0.4 increases in base business expenses. In the base business, a 6.0 million increase in insurance claim costs and premiums and 0.9 million of other net expense increases was partially offset by a 5.5 million, or 5.1 decrease in delivery expenses driven by the 4.2 decline in home heating oil and propane volume sold in the base business. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 For fiscal 2024, depreciation and amortization expense decreased 0.9 million, or 2.6 , to 31.5 million, compared to 32.4 million for fiscal 2023, primarily due to intangible assets that fully amortized in the prior fiscal year. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 For fiscal 2024, general and administrative expenses increased 2.6 million, or 10.2 , to 28.4 million, compared to 25.8 million for fiscal 2023, due to a 0.9 million increase in profit sharing expense, a 0.9 million increase in salaries and benefits expenses and a 0.8 million reduction in the gain on the sale of fixed assets. The Company accrues approximately 6.0 of Adjusted EBITDA as defined in its profit sharing plan for distribution to its employees. This amount is payable when the Company achieves Adjusted EBITDA of at least 70 of the amount budgeted. The dollar amount of the profit sharing pool adjusts accordingly based on Adjusted EBITDA levels achieved. 
 Finance Charge Income 
 For fiscal 2024, finance charge income decreased by 0.9 million, or 17.0 , to 4.6 million compared to 5.5 million for fiscal 2023, due to less late customer payment charges on reduced aged receivables that was partially driven by the reduction in sales. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 For fiscal 2024, net interest expense decreased by 3.9 million, or 25.6 , to 11.6 million compared to 15.5 million for fiscal 2023. The year-over-year change was driven by a decrease in average borrowings of 52.8 million from 211.7 million for the fiscal 2023 to 158.9 million for fiscal 2024 that was partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate from 6.5 for fiscal 2023 to 7.3 for fiscal 2024. To hedge against rising interest 
 35 

rates, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps. At September 30, 2024, approximately 25 of borrowings under Star's variable-rate long term debt were not subject to interest rate increases as a result of interest rate swaps. 
 
 Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs 
 For fiscal 2024, amortization of debt issuance costs decreased to 1.0 million from 1.1 million for fiscal 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 For fiscal 2024, the Company s income tax expense decreased by 0.7 million to 13.3 million, from 14.0 million for fiscal 2023. The decrease was driven by a decrease in the effective income tax rate from 30.4 for fiscal 2023 to 27.5 for fiscal 2024 due primarily to a reduction in state taxes and a decrease in valuation allowance that was partially offset by a 2.6 million increase in income before income taxes. 
 Net Income 
 For fiscal 2024, net income increased 3.3 million, or 10.3 , to 35.2 million, primarily due to a 14.7 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA, a 3.9 million decrease in interest expense, a 0.9 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses and a decrease in income tax expense of 0.7 million that was partially offset by a 17.0 million unfavorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 For fiscal 2024, Adjusted EBITDA increased by 14.7 million, or 15.2 , to 111.6 million compared to fiscal 2023, as an increase in home heating oil and propane per gallon margins, an increase in service and installation profitability and the additional Adjusted EBITDA from acquisitions more than offset a reduction in home heating oil and propane volume sold in the base business and a decrease in the weather hedge benefit of 5.0 million year-over-year. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (as an indicator of operating performance) or as an alternative to cash flow (as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations), but provide additional information for evaluating the Company s ability to make the Minimum Quarterly Distribution.

our compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements; 

our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or historical cost basis; 

our operating performance and return on invested capital compared to those of other companies in the retail distribution of refined petroleum products, without regard to financing methods and capital structure; 

our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners; and 

the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities. 

The method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may not be consistent with that of other companies, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA both have limitations as analytical tools and so should not be viewed in isolation and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are: 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash used for capital expenditures; 

37 

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized often will have to be replaced and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash requirements for such replacements; 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital requirements; 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash necessary to make payments of interest or principal on our indebtedness; and 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to pay taxes. 

Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 
 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022 
 See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations within the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 for the fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2022 comparative discussion. 
 DISCUSSION OF CASH FLOWS 
 We use the indirect method to prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payment during the period. 
 Operating Activities 
 Due to the seasonal nature of our business, cash is generally used in operations during the winter (our first and second fiscal quarters) as we require additional working capital to support the high volume of sales during this period, and cash is generally provided by operating activities during the spring and summer (our third and fourth quarters) when customer payments exceed the cost of deliveries. 
 During fiscal 2024, cash provided by operating activities decreased 12.7 million to 111.0 million, compared to 123.7 million provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023. The decrease was driven by a decrease in collection of trade receivables on a comparable basis (including accounts receivable and customer credit balance accounts) of 37.4 million that was partially offset by a 14.2 million increase in cash flows from operations, 5.2 million less payroll taxes paid in the first fiscal quarter of 2024 versus the first fiscal quarter of 2023 as the result of deferring payment of certain payroll tax withholdings in first quarter of fiscal 2021 to the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023, a 2.1 million decrease in cash required to purchase product inventory and 3.2 million of other net changes in working capital. 
 During fiscal 2023, cash provided by operating activities increased 89.8 million to 123.7 million, compared to 33.9 million provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022. The increase was driven by an increase in collection of trade receivables on a comparable basis (including accounts receivable and customer credit balance accounts) of 70.8 million and a 48.1 million decrease in cash required to purchase liquid product inventory on-hand at fiscal year end primarily driven by a reduction in cost of recent inventory purchases compared to the prior year. Further contributing to the increase was a 14.0 million decrease in net cash paid for certain hedge positions and 2.5 million increase in collection of derivative settlement receivables on a comparative basis. The increase was partially offset by a 25.9 million unfavorable change in accounts payable due to the pricing and timing of inventory purchases, an 11.7 million decrease in cash flows from operations, 5.2 million more in payroll taxes paid in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 versus the first fiscal quarter of 2022 as the result of deferring payment of certain payroll tax withholdings in first quarter of fiscal 2021 to the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023, and 2.8 million of other net changes in working capital. 
 38 

Investing Activities 
 Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 totaled 10.7 million, as we invested in our fleet and other equipment 6.1 million), refurbished certain physical plants 2.1 million), expanded our propane operations 1.2 million) and invested in computer hardware and software 1.3 million). 
 During fiscal 2024, 1.7 million of earnings were reinvested into an irrevocable trust to secure certain liabilities for our captive insurance company. The cash deposited into the trust is shown on our balance sheet as captive insurance collateral and, correspondingly, reduced cash on our balance sheet. We believe that investments into the irrevocable trust will lower our letter of credit fees, increase interest income on invested cash balances, and provide us with certain tax advantages attributable to a captive insurance company. 
 During fiscal 2024, the Company acquired one propane and four heating oil businesses for approximately 49.4 million in cash. The gross purchase price was allocated 40.4 million to intangible assets, 13.7 million to goodwill, 4.9 million to fixed assets, and reduced by 9.6 million in negative working capital. 
 Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 totaled 9.0 million, as we invested in our fleet and other equipment 5.5 million), refurbished certain physical plants 1.4 million), expanded our propane operations 1.0 million) and invested in computer hardware and software 1.1 million). 
 During fiscal 2023, we deposited 1.6 million, and invested another 0.9 million, into an irrevocable trust to secure certain liabilities for our captive insurance company. 
 During fiscal 2023, the Company acquired one propane and two heating oil businesses for approximately 19.8 million in cash. The gross purchase price was allocated 10.4 million to intangible assets, 8.0 million to goodwill, 2.3 million to fixed assets, and reduced by 0.9 million in negative working capital. 
 Financing Activities 
 During fiscal 2024, we refinanced our five-year term loan and the revolving credit facility with the execution of the seventh amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement. This amendment extended our bank facility to September 2029. The 210 million of proceeds from the new term loan were used to repay the 132.1 million outstanding balance of the term loan under the prior credit facility. Prior to amending the bank facility, we also repaid 16.4 million of our term loan, borrowed 79.6 million under our revolving credit facility and subsequently repaid 79.8 million. We also repurchased approximately 1.0 million Common Units for 11.1 million in connection with our unit repurchase plan, and paid distributions of 23.6 million to our Common Unit holders and 1.4 million to our General Partner unit holders (including 1.3 million of incentive distributions as provided in our Partnership Agreement). 
 During fiscal 2023, we repaid 16.5 million of our term loan, borrowed 125.6 million under our revolving credit facility and subsequently repaid 145.6 million. We also repurchased 0.5 million Common Units for 4.5 million in connection with our unit repurchase plan, and paid distributions of 22.5 million to our Common Unit holders and 1.2 million to our General Partner unit holders (including 1.16 million of incentive distributions as provided in our Partnership Agreement). 
 FINANCING AND SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources Comparatives 
 Our primary uses of liquidity are to provide funds for our working capital, capital expenditures, distributions on our units, acquisitions and unit repurchases. Our ability to provide funds for such uses depends on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic, financial, geopolitical and business conditions, weather, the ability to collect current and future accounts receivable, the ability to pass on the full impact of high product costs to customers, the effects of high net customer attrition, conservation, inflation and other factors. 
 Funding for capital requirements, at least in the near term, are expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 117.3 million) or a combination thereof. We believe that these cash sources will also be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements in the longer-term. However, if they are not sufficient, we anticipate that working capital will be financed by our revolving credit facility, as discussed below, and from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2024, 
 39 

we had accounts receivable of 95.0 million of which 63.5 million is due from residential customers and 31.5 million is due from commercial customers. Our ability to borrow from our bank group is based in part on the aging of these accounts receivable. If these balances do not meet the eligibility tests as defined in our credit agreement, our ability to borrow will be reduced and our anticipated cash flow from operating activities will also be reduced. As of September 30, 2024, we had less than 0.1 million borrowings under our revolving credit facility, 210.0 million outstanding under our term loan, 5.2 million in letters of credit outstanding and 14.2 million hedge positions were secured under the credit agreement. 
 Under the terms of the credit agreement, if we permit Availability (as defined in the credit agreement) to be less than the greater of (a) 12.5 of the Line Cap (lesser of the revolving credit facility borrowings and the borrowing base) and (b) 35.0 million, we must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10. We are also required to maintain a senior secured leverage ratio that cannot be more than 3.0 as of June 30 th or September 30 th , and no more than 5.5 as of December 31 st or March 31 st . As of September 30 2024 Availability as defined in the seventh amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement was 166.5 million and we were in compliance with the financial covenants. 
 Maintenance capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 are estimated to be approximately 12.8 million, excluding the capital requirements for leased fleet which we currently estimate to be 13.3 million. In addition, we plan to invest approximately 1.7 million in our propane operations. Distributions for fiscal 2025, at the current quarterly level of 0.1725 per unit, would result in aggregate payments of approximately 23.9 million to Common Unit holders, 1.5 million to our General Partner (including 1.4 million of incentive distribution as provided for in our Partnership Agreement) and 1.4 million to management pursuant to the management incentive compensation plan which provides for certain members of management to receive incentive distributions that would otherwise be payable to the General Partner. Under the terms of our seventh amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement, our term loan is repayable in quarterly payments of 5.3 million. We are not required to make an additional term loan repayments due to Excess Cash Flow in fiscal 2024 (see Note 13 - Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings). Further, subject to any additional liquidity issues or concerns resulting from wholesale price volatility, we intend to continue to repurchase Common Units pursuant to our unit repurchase plan, as amended from time to time, and seek attractive acquisition opportunities within the Availability constraints of our revolving credit facility and funding resources. 
 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no obligations arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity and, we have no off-balance sheet debt. 
 Long-term contractual obligations, except for our long-term debt and New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund withdrawal obligations and operating leases liabilities, are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Non-cancelable purchase obligations are obligations we incur during the normal course of business, based on projected needs. The Company had no capital lease obligations as of September 30, 2024. 
 The table below summarizes the payment schedule of our contractual obligations at September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Critical Accounting Policy and Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company evaluates its policies and estimates on an on-going basis. A change in any of these critical accounting policies and estimates could have a material effect on the results of operations. The Company s Consolidated Financial Statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions. The Company s critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following are our critical accounting policies and estimates: 
 Critical Accounting Policy 
 Fair Values of Derivatives 
 FASB ASC 815-10-05, Derivatives and Hedging, requires that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The Company has elected not to designate its commodity derivative instruments as hedging instruments under this guidance, and therefore the change in fair value of those derivative instruments are recognized in our statement of operations. 
 We have established the fair value of our derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated them internally using established index prices and other sources. These values are based upon, among other things, future prices, volatility, time-to-maturity value and credit risk. The estimate of fair value we report in our financial statements changes as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions, or other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Self-Insurance Liabilities 
 We currently self-insure a portion of workers compensation, auto, general liability and medical claims. We establish and periodically evaluate self-insurance liabilities based upon expectations as to what our ultimate liability may be for outstanding claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience, including frequency, severity, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions, supplemented with the support of a qualified third-party actuary. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 76.7 million of self-insurance liabilities. The ultimate resolution of these claims could differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate the self-insurance liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. 
 41 

ITEM 7A. 	 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our credit agreement. We utilize these borrowings to meet our working capital needs. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings totaling 210.0 million, of which 158.0 million are subject to variable interest rates under our credit agreement. In the event that interest rates associated with this facility were to increase 100 basis points, the after tax impact on annual future cash flows would be a decrease of 1.1 million. 
 We regularly use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to market risk related to changes in the current and future market price of home heating oil. The value of market sensitive derivative instruments is subject to change as a result of movements in market prices. Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to evaluate the impact of hypothetical market value changes. Based on a hypothetical ten percent increase in the cost of product at September 30, 2024, the potential impact on our hedging activity would be to increase the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by 7.1 million from (14.1) million to a fair market value of (7.0) million; and conversely a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the cost of product would decrease the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by 5.0 million to a fair market value of (19.1) million. 
 ITEM 8. 	 FINANCIAL STATEMEN TS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
 The financial statements and financial statement schedules referred to in the index contained on page F-1 of this Report are incorporated herein by reference. 
 ITEM 9. 	 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOU NTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 None. 
 ITEM 9A. 	 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
 Our general partner s chief executive officer and our chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, such chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable level of assurance. For purposes of Rule 13a-15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under the supervision of management and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included at Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 42 

(c) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 (d) Other. 
 Our general partner and the Company believe that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are, or will be met, and that regardless of our evaluation of controls we cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Therefore, our controls system, no matter how well we believe it may be conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the Company's controls system are met, or will be met. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurances of achieving our desired control objectives, and the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our general partner have concluded, as of September 30, 2024, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in achieving that level of reasonable assurance.

PART III 
 ITEM 10. 	 DIR ECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
 Partnership Management 
 Our general partner is Kestrel Heat. The Board of Directors of Kestrel Heat is appointed by its sole member, Kestrel, which is a private investment partnership owned by Yorktown Energy Partners XII, L.P., Paul A. Vermylen Jr. and other investors. 
 Kestrel Heat, as our general partner, oversees our activities. Unitholders do not directly or indirectly participate in our management or operation or elect the directors of the general partner. The Board of Directors (sometimes referred to as the Board of Kestrel Heat has adopted a set of Partnership Governance Guidelines in accordance with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. A copy of these Guidelines is available on our website at www.stargrouplp.com. 
 As of November 30, 2024, Kestrel Heat owned 325,729 general partner units. In November 2021, Kestrel Heat made an in-kind distribution of 500,000 common units, representing approximately 1 of the issued and outstanding common units, to Kestrel, which, in turn, made an in-kind distribution of such units, pro rata, to its members. 
 The general partner owes a fiduciary duty to the unitholders. However, our Partnership Agreement contains provisions that allow the general partner to take into account the interests of parties other than the limited partners in resolving conflict of interest, thereby limiting such fiduciary duty. Notwithstanding any limitation on obligations or duties, the general partner will be liable, as our general partner, for all our debts (to the extent not paid by us), except to the extent that indebtedness or other obligations incurred by us are made specifically non-recourse to the general partner. 
 The general partner does not directly employ any of the persons responsible for managing or operating Star. 
 Directors and Executive Officers of the General Partner 
 Directors are appointed for an indefinite term, subject to the discretion of Kestrel. The following table shows certain information for directors and executive officers of the general partner as of November 30, 2024:

ITEM 11. 	EXECUTI VE COMPENSATION 
 Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
 Our Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, provides that our general partner, Kestrel Heat, shall conduct, direct and manage all activities of the Company. The limited liability company agreement of the general partner provides that the business of the general partner shall be managed by a Board of Directors. The responsibility of the Board is to supervise and direct the management of the Company in the interest and for the benefit of our unitholders. Among the Board s responsibilities is to regularly evaluate the performance and to approve the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and, with the advice of the Chief Executive Officer, regularly evaluate the performance and approve the compensation of key executives. 
 As a limited partnership that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we are not required to have a Compensation Committee. Since the Chairman of the general partner and the majority of the Board are not employees, the Board determined that it has adequate independence to act in the capacity of a Compensation Committee to establish and review the compensation of our executive officers and directors. The Board is comprised of Paul A. Vermylen Jr. (Chairman), Jeffrey M. Woosnam (President and Chief Executive Officer), Daniel P. Donovan, Henry D. Babcock, David M. Bauer, C. Scott Baxter, Bryan H. Lawrence, and William P. Nicoletti. 
 Throughout this Report, each person who served as chief executive officer CEO during fiscal 2024, each person who served as chief financial officer CFO during fiscal 2024 and the two other most highly compensated executive officers serving at September 30, 2024 (there being no other executive officers) are referred to as the named executive officers and are included in the Executive Compensation Table. 
 In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we address the compensation paid or awarded to Messrs. Woosnam, Ambury, Hammond and McDonald. We refer to these executive officers as our named executive officers. 
 Compensation decisions for the above named executive officers were made by the Board of Directors of the Company. 
 Compensation Philosophy and Policies 
 The primary objectives of our compensation program, including compensation of the named executive officers, are to attract and retain highly qualified officers, employees and directors and to reward individual contributions to our success. The Board of Directors considers the following policies in determining the compensation of the named executive officers: 
 compensation should be related to the performance of the individual executive and the performance measured against both financial and non-financial achievements; 

compensation levels should be competitive to ensure that we will be able to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executive officers; and 

compensation should be related to improving unitholder value over time. 

49 

Compensation Methodology 
 The elements of our compensation program for named executive officers are intended to provide a total incentive package designed to drive performance and reward contributions in support of business strategies at the Company. Subject to the terms of employment agreements that have been entered into with certain named executive officers, all compensation determinations are discretionary and subject to the decision-making authority of the Board of Directors. We do not use benchmarking as a fixed criterion to determine compensation. Rather, after subjectively setting compensation based on the policies discussed above under Compensation Philosophy and Policies , we reviewed the compensation paid to officers holding similar positions at our peer group companies and certain information for privately held companies to obtain a general understanding of the reasonableness of base salaries and other compensation payable to our named executive officers. Our peer group of public companies was comprised of the following companies: Atmos Energy Corporation, Crestwood Equity Partners L.P., Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., Global Partners, L.P., New Jersey Resources Corporation, NuStar Energy L.P., Suburban Propane Partners, L.P. and Sunoco L.P. We chose these companies because they are engaged in the distribution of energy products like us. 
 Elements of Executive Compensation 
 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the principal components of compensation for the named executive officers were: 
 base salary; 

annual discretionary profit sharing allocation; 

the management incentive compensation plan; and 

retirement and health benefits. 

Under our compensation structure, the mix of base salary, discretionary profit sharing allocation and long-term compensation provided to each executive officer varies depending on their position. The base salary for each executive officer is the only fixed component of compensation. All other compensation, including annual discretionary profit sharing allocation and long-term incentive compensation, is variable in nature. 
 The majority of the Company s compensation allocation is weighted towards base salary and annual discretionary profit sharing allocation. In addition, during fiscal 2024, an aggregate of 558,867 was paid to the named executive officers under the terms of the management incentive compensation plan and represented a small portion of the executive compensation that was paid to these officers. If we are successful in increasing the overall level of distributions payable to unitholders, the amounts payable to the named executive officers under the management incentive compensation plan should increase. 
 We believe that together all of our compensation components provide a balanced mix of fixed compensation and compensation that is contingent upon each executive officer s individual performance and our overall performance. A goal of the compensation program is to provide executive officers with a reasonable level of security through base salary and benefits, while rewarding them through incentive compensation to achieve business objectives and create unitholder value over time. We believe that each of our compensation components is important in achieving this goal. Base salaries provide executives with a base level of monthly income and security. Annual discretionary profit sharing allocations and long-term incentive awards provide an incentive to our executives to achieve business objectives that increase our financial performance, which creates unitholder value through continuity of, and increases in, distributions and increases in the market value of the units. In addition, we want to ensure that our compensation programs are appropriately designed to encourage executive officer retention, which is accomplished through all of our compensation elements. 
 50 

Base Salary 
 The Board of Directors establishes base salaries for the named executive officers based on a number of factors, including: 
 the historical salaries for services rendered to the Company and responsibilities of the named executive officer; 

the salaries of equivalent executive officers at our peer group companies and other data for our industry; and 

the prevailing levels of compensation and cost of living in the location in which the named executive officer works. 

In determining the initial base compensation payable to individual named executive officers when they are first hired by Star, our starting point is the historical compensation levels that we have paid to officers performing similar functions over the past few years. We also consider the level of experience and accomplishments of individual candidates and general labor market conditions, including the availability of candidates to fill a particular position. When we make adjustments to the base salaries of existing named executive officers, we review the individual s performance, the value each named executive officer brings to us and general labor market conditions. 
 Elements of individual performance considered, among others, without any specific weight given to each element, include business-related accomplishments during the year, difficulty and scope of responsibilities, effective leadership, experience, expected future contributions to the Company and difficulty of replacement. While base salary provides a base level of compensation intended to be competitive with the external market, the base salary for each named executive officer is determined on a subjective basis after consideration of these factors and is not based on target percentiles or other formal criteria. Although we believe that base salaries for our named executive officers are generally competitive with the external market, we do not use benchmarking as a fixed criterion to determine base compensation. Rather, after subjectively setting base salaries based on the above factors, we review the compensation paid to officers holding similar positions at our peer group companies to obtain a general understanding of the reasonableness of base salaries and other compensation payable to our named executive officers. We also take into account geographic differences for similar positions in the New York Metropolitan area. While cost of living is considered in determining annual increases, we do not typically provide full cost of living adjustments as salary increases are constrained by budgetary restrictions and the ability to fund the Company s current cash needs such as interest expense, maintenance capital, income taxes and distributions. 
 Profit Sharing Allocations 
 We maintain a profit sharing pool for certain employees, including named executive officers, which is equal to approximately 6 of our earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding items affecting comparability adjusted EBITDA for the given fiscal year. The annual discretionary profit sharing allocations paid to the named executive officers are payable from this pool. The size of the pool fluctuates based upon upward or downwards changes in adjusted EBITDA and the size of an individual award to a named executive officer fluctuates based on the size of the profit sharing pool and the number of participants in the plan. Depending upon the size of the profit sharing pool, and the number of participants in the plan, the amount paid to the named executive officers could be more or less. 
 There are no set formulas for determining the amount payable to our named executive officers from the profit sharing plan. Factors considered by our CEO and the Board in determining the level of profit sharing allocations generally include, without assigning a particular weight to any factor: 
 whether or not we achieved certain budgeted goals for the year and any material shortfalls or superior performances relative to expectations. Under the plan, no profit sharing was payable with respect to fiscal 2024 unless we achieved actual adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2024 of at least 70 of the amount of budgeted adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2024; 

the level of difficulty associated with achieving such objectives based on the opportunities and challenges encountered during the year; and 

significant transactions or accomplishments for the period not included in the goals for the year. 

51 

Our CEO takes these factors into consideration as well as the relative contributions of each of the named executive officers to the year s performance in developing his recommendations for profit sharing amounts. Based on such assessment, our CEO submits recommendations to the Board of Directors for the annual profit sharing amounts to be paid to our named executive officers (other than the CEO), for the Board s review and approval. Similarly, the Chairman assesses the CEO s contribution toward meeting the Company s goals based upon the above factors, and recommends to the Board of Directors a profit sharing allocation for the CEO it believes to be commensurate with such contribution. 
 The Board of Directors retains the ultimate discretion to determine whether the named executive officers will receive annual profit sharing allocations based upon the factors discussed above. The Company is entitled to recover or clawback profit sharing allocations paid to our named executive officers in the event of any accounting restatement arising from a material non-compliance with the financial reporting requirements under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, in accordance with the Company s Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy dated as of October 19, 2023 (the Clawback Policy ). At no time during or after the Company s fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 was the Company required to prepare any accounting restatement that would have entitled the Company to recovery of profit sharing allocations under the Company s Clawback Policy. The Company s Clawback Policy is filed as an Exhibit to this Report. 
 Management Incentive Compensation Plan 
 In fiscal 2007, following our recapitalization, the Board of Directors adopted the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan for certain named employees at the time. Effective as of July 19, 2012, the Board of Directors adopted certain amendments (the Plan Amendments to the Plan. Under the Plan Amendments, the number and identity of the Plan participants and their participation interests in the Plan have been frozen at the current levels. In addition, under the Plan Amendments, the plan benefits (to the extent vested) may be transferred upon the death of a participant to his or her heirs. Under the Plan, certain current and former employees who participate shall be entitled to receive a pro rata share (as determined in the manner described below) of an amount in cash equal to: 
 50 of the distributions Incentive Distributions of Available Cash in excess of the minimum quarterly distribution of 0.0675 per unit otherwise distributable to Kestrel Heat pursuant to the Partnership Agreement on account of its general partner units; and 

50 of the cash proceeds (the Gains Interest which Kestrel Heat shall receive from any sale of its general partner units (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), less expenses and applicable taxes. 

We believe that the Plan provides a long-term incentive to its participants because it encourages Star s management to increase available cash for distributions in order to trigger the incentive distributions that are only payable if distributions from available cash exceed certain target distribution levels, with higher amounts of incentive distributions triggered by higher levels of distributions. Such increases are not sustainable on a consistent basis without long-term improvements in our operations. 
 The pro rata share payable to the named executive officers under the Plan is based on the number of participation points as described under Fiscal 2024 Compensation Decisions Management Incentive Compensation Plan. The amount paid in Incentive Distributions is governed by the Partnership Agreement and Available Cash (as defined in our Partnership Agreement) is distributed to the holders of our common units and general partner units in the following manner: 
 First, 100 to all common units, pro rata, until there has been distributed to each common unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of 0.0675 for that quarter; 
 Second, 100 to all common units, pro rata, until there has been distributed to each common unit an amount equal to any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution for prior quarters; 
 Third, 100 to all general partner units, pro rata, until there has been distributed to each general partner unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution; 
 52 

Fourth, 90 to all common units, pro rata, and 10 to all general partner units, pro rata, until each common unit has received the first target distribution of 0.1125; and 
 Finally, 80 to all common units, pro rata, and 20 to all general partner units, pro rata. 
 Available Cash, as defined in our Partnership Agreement, generally means all cash on hand at the end of the relevant fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the Board of Directors of our general partner in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements. These reserves are established for the proper conduct of our business, including acquisitions, the payment of debt principal and interest and for distributions during the next four quarters and to comply with applicable law and the terms of any debt agreements or other agreements to which we are subject. The Board of Directors of our general partner reviews the level of Available Cash each quarter based upon information provided by management. 
 To fund the benefits under the Plan, Kestrel Heat has agreed to permanently and irrevocably forego receipt of the amount of Incentive Distributions that are payable to plan participants. For accounting purposes, amounts payable to management under this Plan will be treated as compensation and will reduce both EBITDA and net income but not adjusted EBITDA. Kestrel Heat has also agreed to contribute to the Company, as a contribution to capital, an amount equal to the Gains Interest payable to participants in the Plan by the Company. The Company is not required to reimburse Kestrel Heat for amounts payable pursuant to the Plan. 
 The Plan is administered by our Chief Financial Officer under the direction of the Board or by such other officer as the Board may from time to time direct. In general, no payments will be made under the Plan if we are not distributing cash under the Incentive Distributions described above. 
 We distributed 1,322,059 in Incentive Distributions under the Plan during fiscal 2024, including payments to former employees and their heirs of approximately 679,063 and the named executive officers of approximately 558,867. With regard to the Gains Interest, Kestrel Heat has not given any indication that it will sell its general partner units within the next 12 months. Thus the Plan s value attributable to the Gains Interest currently cannot be determined. 
 Retirement and Health Benefits 
 We offer a health and welfare and retirement program to all eligible employees. The named executive officers are generally eligible for the same programs on the same basis as other employees of Star. We maintain a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement plan that provides eligible employees with an opportunity to save for retirement on a tax advantaged basis. Under the 401(k) plan, subject to IRS limitations, each participant can contribute from 0 to 60 of compensation. 
 We make a 4 (or a maximum of 5.5 for participants who had 10 or more years of service at the time our defined benefit plans were frozen and who have reached the age 55) core contribution of a participant s compensation and generally can match 2/3 (up to 3.0 of a participant s contributions, subject to IRS limitations. 
 In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we have one frozen defined benefit pension plan that was maintained for all eligible employees, including certain executive officers. The present value of accumulated benefits under this frozen defined benefit pension plan for certain executive officers is provided in the table labeled Pension Plans Pursuant to Which Named Executive Officers Have an Accumulated Benefit But Are Not Currently Accruing Benefits.

For our peers that are on a fiscal year similar to Star Group, the average percentage increase in Adjusted EBITDA was 8.6 , and the average total compensation increased by 17.1 . 
 Another performance measure is acquisitions. During fiscal 2024, the Company acquired four heating oil businesses and one propane business with an aggregate purchase price of 49.4 million that are expected to generate approximately 23.3 million gallons of home heating oil and propane annually. Messrs. Woosnam, Ambury, Hammond and McDonald were instrumental in the successful integration of these transactions. 
 In addition, the Company extended its banking facility which provided availability for recent and future acquisitions at the same pricing under the previous facility. 
 Management Incentive Compensation Plan 
 In 2012, under the Plan Amendments adopted by the Board, the number and identity of the Plan participants and their participation points were frozen at the current levels in order to more closely align the interests of Plan participants and unitholders and to give Plan participants a continuing personal interest in our success. The number of participation points that were previously awarded to the named executive officers was based on the length of service and level of responsibility of the named executive and our desire to retain the named executive.

Retirement and Health Benefits 
 The named executive officers participate in our retirement and health benefit plans. 
 Employment Contracts and Severance Agreements 
 Agreement with Richard F. Ambury 
 We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Ambury effective as of April 28, 2008. Mr. Ambury will serve as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer on an at-will basis. The employment agreement provides for one year s salary as severance if Mr. Ambury s employment is terminated without cause or by Mr. Ambury for good reason. 
 Agreement with Jeffrey M. Woosnam 
 We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Woosnam effective as of June 19, 2019. Mr. Woosnam will serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of Kestrel Heat on an at-will basis. The employment agreement provides for one year s salary as severance if Mr. Woosnam s employment is terminated without cause or by Mr. Woosnam for good reason. 
 Change in Control Agreements 
 Change in control arrangements are included in the employment agreement for Mr. Woosnam, Chief Executive Officer and we have entered into a Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Ambury, Chief Financial Officer. Under the terms of each agreement, if either of these executive officers is terminated within 180 days following a change in control (as defined in the agreement), he will be entitled to a payment equal to two times his base annual salary in the year of such termination plus two times the average amount paid as a bonus and/or as profit sharing during the three years preceding the year of such termination. The term change in control means the present equity owners of Kestrel Heat and their affiliates collectively cease to beneficially own equity interests having the voting power to elect at least a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or other governing board of the general partner or any successor entity. If a change in control were to have occurred and their employment was terminated as of the date of this Report, Mr. Woosnam would have received a payment of 2,224,330 and Mr. Ambury would have received a payment of 1,962,735.

Pay Ratio Disclosure 
 As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the ratio of the annual total compensation, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K of our CEO, Jeffrey M. Woosnam and the annual total compensation of our median employee. For fiscal 2024, our last completed fiscal year, our CEO s total compensation was 1,255,821 versus our median employee compensation of 75,577. This reflects a CEO pay ratio of 17:1. We identified our median compensation employee by examining total compensation paid for fiscal year 2024 to all individuals, excluding Mr. Woosnam, who were employed by us on September 30, 2024, the last day of our fiscal year based on payroll records. No assumptions, adjustments or estimates were made in respect of total compensation, except that we annualized the compensation of any employee that was not employed with us for all of fiscal year 2024, excluding seasonal and temporary employees. 
 Indemnification Agreements 
 We have entered into an indemnification agreement with each of our directors and senior executives. These agreements provide for us to, among other things, indemnify such persons against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, to advance their expenses incurred as a result of a proceeding as to which they may be indemnified and to cover such person under any directors and officers liability insurance policy we choose, in our discretion, to maintain. These indemnification agreements are intended to provide indemnification rights to the fullest extent permitted under applicable indemnification rights statutes in the State of Delaware and are in addition to any other rights such person may have under our Partnership Agreement and the limited liability company agreement of our general partner, and applicable law. We believe these indemnification agreements enhance our ability to attract and retain knowledgeable and experienced executives and independent, non-management directors. 
 Board of Directors Report 
 The Board of Directors of the general partner of the Company does not have a separate compensation committee. Executive compensation is determined by the Board of Directors. 
 The Board of Directors reviewed and discussed with the Company s management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on that review and discussion, the Board of Directors recommends that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2024.

In June 2023, Mr. Ambury received a 64,059 lump sum distribution under the SERP in connection with this withdrawal from the SERP. Mr. Ambury is not entitled to receive any further benefits under the SERP.

(1) The named executive officer has accumulated benefits in the tax-qualified Petro defined benefit pension plan that was frozen in 1997. Mr. Ambury also participated in a tax-qualified supplemental employee retirement plan which, prior to being frozen in 1997, represented contributions to an employee plan to compensate for a reduction in certain benefits prior to 1997. No other named executives were participants in any of these plans. Each year, the named executive officer s accumulated benefits are actuarially calculated generally based on the credited years of service and each employee s compensation at the time the plan was frozen. The present value of these amounts are the present value of a single life annuity generally payable at later or normal retirement age, adjusted for changes in discount rates and government mandated mortality tables. See Note 14 Employee Benefit Plans, to Star s Consolidated Financial Statements, for the material assumptions applied in quantifying the present value of the accumulated benefits of the frozen plan.

 ITEM 13. 	CERTAIN RELATIONSHI PS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
 Star has a written conflict of interest policy and procedure that requires all officers, directors and employees to report to senior corporate management or the board of directors, all personal, financial or family interest in transactions that involve the individual and the Star. In addition, our Governance Guidelines provide that any 
 61 

monetary arrangement between a director and his or her affiliates (including any member of a director s immediate family) and the Company or any of its affiliates for goods or services shall be subject to approval by the full Board of Directors. 
 The general partner does not receive any management fee or other compensation for its management of Star. The general partner is reimbursed for all expenses incurred on behalf of the Star, including the cost of compensation, that are properly allocable to Star. Our Partnership Agreement provides that the general partner shall determine the expenses that are allocable to Star in any reasonable manner determined by the general partner in its sole discretion. In addition, the general partner and its affiliates may provide services to the Star for which a reasonable fee would be charged as determined by the general partner. 
 Kestrel has the ability to elect the Board of Directors of Kestrel Heat, including Messrs. Vermylen, Bauer and Lawrence. Messrs. Vermylen, Bauer and Lawrence are also members of the board of managers of Kestrel and, either directly or through affiliated entities, own equity interests in Kestrel. Kestrel owns all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Kestrel Heat. 
 Policies Regarding Transactions with Related Persons 
 Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Partnership Governance Guidelines and Partnership Agreement set forth policies and procedures with respect to transactions with persons affiliated with the Company and the resolution of conflicts of interest, which taken together provide the Company with a framework for the review and approval of transactions with related persons as such terms are defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K. 
 In connection with the Company s acquisition of assets that currently form part of the Company s Pennsylvania operations, the Company (through one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries) entered into an agreement to lease certain real estate from the seller of such assets in August 1994. The seller of such assets and the original lessor of the real estate was an entity in which Douglas Woosnam, the father of Jeffrey Woosnam, our president and chief executive officer, held a direct, material interest. Since August 1994, the original lease agreement has been amended and extended multiple times. Further, the original lessor assigned the lease to Douglas Woosnam. The last such amendment and extension occurred in June 2024. Pursuant to the terms of that amendment, the lease was extended for an additional period commencing September 13, 2026 and ending September 12, 2036. The total rent for the ten-year period commencing September 13, 2026 is 2,186,095.20, payable in 120 monthly payments escalating from 17,239.63 per month in the first year of the extension to 20,673.58 per month in the last year of the extended lease period. The lease amendment also increases the financial responsibility of the landlord should storage tanks on the property need a new repairs from 50 percent of the costs in the first year of the extension to full financial responsibility by the last year of the extension. The lease and all amendments were negotiated at arms length and the rent payable on a per square foot basis is comparable to the per square foot rental rates of similar commercial property in Southampton, Pennsylvania. The Company is responsible for taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance of the premises. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we paid 200,850 in the aggregate to the lessor under the lease agreement. 
 Other than the lease agreement discussed above, for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, Star had no related party transactions or agreements pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K. 
 Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to our directors, officers, employees and their affiliates. It deals with conflicts of interest (e.g., transactions with the Company), confidential information, use of Star assets, business dealings, and other similar topics. The Code requires officers, directors and employees to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest and to report potential conflicts of interest to the Company s Vice President - Controller or Director of Internal Audit. 
 Our Partnership Governance Guidelines provide that any monetary arrangement between a director and his or her affiliates (including any member of a director s immediate family) and the Company or any of its affiliates for goods or services shall be subject to approval by the full Board of Directors. Although the Partnership Governance Guidelines by their terms only apply to directors the Board intends to apply this requirement to officers and employees and their affiliates. 
 62 

To the extent that the Board determines that it would be in the best interests of the Company to enter into a transaction with a related person, the Board intends to utilize the procedures set forth in the Partnership Agreement for the review and approval of potential conflicts of interest. Our Partnership Agreement provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the general partner or any of its Affiliates (including its directors, executive officers and controlling members), on the one hand, and the Company or any partner, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by all partners, and shall not constitute a breach of the Partnership Agreement, of any agreement contemplated therein, or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action is, or by operation of the Partnership Agreement is deemed to be, fair and reasonable to the Company. 
 Any conflict of interest and any resolution of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed fair and reasonable to the Company if such conflict of interest or resolution is (i) approved by a committee of independent directors (the Conflicts Committee ), (ii) on terms no less favorable to the Company than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iii) fair to the Company, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Company). 
 The general partner (including the Conflicts Committee) is authorized in connection with its determination of what is fair and reasonable to the Company and in connection with its resolution of any conflict of interest to consider: 
 (a) the relative interests of any party to such conflict, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interest; 

(b) any customary or accepted industry practices and any customary or historical dealings with a particular person; 

(c) any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles; and 

(d) such additional factors as the general partner (including the Conflicts Committee) determines in its sole discretion to be relevant, reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances. 

Director Independence 
 Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange listed company manual provides that limited partnerships are not required to have a majority of independent directors. It is the policy of the Board of Directors that the Board shall at all times have at least three independent directors or such higher number as may be necessary to comply with the applicable federal securities law requirements. For the purposes of this policy, independent director has the meaning set forth in Section 10A(m) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, any applicable stock exchange rules and the rules and regulations promulgated in the Partnership governance guidelines available on its website www.stargrouplp.com . The Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Nicoletti, Babcock, Bauer and Baxter are independent directors.

Report of Independent Registe red Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Unitholders of Star Group, L.P. and Board of Directors of Kestrel Heat, LLC 
 Star Group, L.P.: 

Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
 F- 2 

that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Evaluation of self-insurance liabilities 
 As discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company self-insures for a number of risks, including a portion of workers compensation, auto, general liability and medical liability. Self-insurance liabilities are established and periodically evaluated, based upon expectations as to what the ultimate liability may be for outstanding claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience, including frequency, severity, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions, with support from a qualified third-party actuary. The balance of the self-insurance liabilities, as of September 30, 2024 amounted to 76.7 million as shown in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. We identified the evaluation of the self-insurance liabilities for workers compensation, auto, and general liability claims as a critical audit matter. Specialized skill and knowledge were necessary to evaluate the actuarial models and key assumptions used to determine the liabilities. Additionally, the evaluation of key assumptions used to estimate the liabilities required complex auditor judgment due to the degree of measurement uncertainty. The key assumptions used include paid and incurred loss development factors, expected loss rates and the selection of the estimated ultimate losses among the estimates derived from the actuarial models. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. 
 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s self-insurance process, including controls related to review of the actuarial models and the development and selection of the key assumptions used in the actuarial calculations. We involved our actuarial professionals with specialized knowledge who assisted in: 
 Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards. 

Evaluating the key assumptions underlying the Company s actuarial estimates by developing an independent expectation of the self-insurance liabilities and comparing the expectation to the amounts recorded by the Company. 

Evaluating the Company s ability to estimate self-insurance liabilities by comparing its historical estimates with actual incurred losses and paid losses. 

/s/ 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 1995.

 reportable segment for accounting purposes. We also sell diesel fuel, gasoline and home heating oil on a delivery only basis.

The Company is organized as follows: Star is a limited partnership, which at September 30, 2024, had outstanding million Common Units (NYSE: SGU ), representing a limited partner interest in Star, and million general partner units, representing a general partner interest in Star.

reporting unit and performs a qualitative, and when necessary quantitative, impairment test on its goodwill annually on August 31 st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill might be impaired. We performed qualitative assessments (commonly referred to as Step 0) to evaluate whether it is more-likely-than-not (a likelihood that is more than that goodwill has been impaired, as a basis to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test. This qualitative assessment includes a review of factors such as our reporting unit s market value compared to its carrying value, our short-term and long-term unit price performance, our planned overall business strategy compared to recent financial results, as well as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant Company-specific events. Goodwill impairment if any, needs to be determined if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. If goodwill is determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the excess of the net book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment valuation in each of the periods ended August 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, and it was determined based on each year s analysis that there was goodwill impairment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The assessment for impairment requires estimates of future cash flows related to the intangible asset. To the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds its future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. We use amortization methods and determine asset values based on our best estimates using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections. Key assumptions used to determine the value of these intangibles include projections of future customer attrition or growth rates, product margin increases, operating expenses, our cost of capital, and corporate income tax rates. For significant acquisitions we may engage a third party valuation firm to assist in the valuation of intangible assets of that acquisition. We assess the useful lives of intangible assets based on the estimated period over which we will receive benefit from such intangible assets such as historical evidence regarding customer churn rate. In some cases, the estimated useful lives are based on contractual terms. Customer lists are the names and addresses of an acquired company s customers. Based on historical retention experience, these lists are amortized on a straight-line basis over seven to .

This obligation does not exist under the contract applicable to fiscal year 2024. The temperatures experienced during the hedge period through March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 were warmer than the strikes in the weather hedge contracts. As a result for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company reduced delivery and branch expenses for the gains realized under those contracts of million, million and million respectively. The amounts were received in full in April 2024, April 2023 and April 2022, respectively.

Performance Obligations Petroleum product revenues consist of home heating oil and propane as well as diesel fuel and gasoline. Revenues from petroleum products are recognized at the time of delivery to the customer when control is passed from the Company to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring control of the petroleum products. Approximately of our full service residential and commercial home heating oil customers automatically receive deliveries based on prevailing weather conditions. We offer several pricing alternatives to our residential home heating oil customers, including a variable price (market based) option and a price-protected option, the latter of which either sets the maximum price or a fixed price that a customer will pay. Equipment maintenance service contracts primarily cover heating, air conditioning, and natural gas equipment. We generally do not sell equipment maintenance service contracts to heating oil customers that do not take delivery of product from us. The service contract period of our equipment maintenance service contracts is generally or less. Revenues from equipment maintenance service contracts are recognized into income over the terms of the respective service contracts, on a straight-line basis. Our obligation to perform service is consistent through the duration of the contracts, and the straight-line basis of recognition is a faithful depiction of the transfer of our services. To the extent that the Company anticipates that future costs for fulfilling its contractual obligations under its equipment service contracts will exceed the amount of deferred revenue currently attributable to these contracts, the Company recognizes a loss in current period earnings equal to the amount that anticipated future costs exceed related deferred revenues.

days. Sales reported for product, installations and services exclude taxes assessed by various governmental authorities. Contract Costs , other than new residential product and equipment maintenance service contracts, as an expense when incurred when the amortization period of the asset that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. We recognize an asset for incremental commission expenses paid to sales personnel in conjunction with obtaining new residential customer product and equipment maintenance service contracts. We defer these costs only when we have determined the commissions are, in fact, incremental and would not have been incurred absent the customer contract. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably as delivery and branch expenses over the period representing the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. Costs to obtain new residential product and equipment maintenance service contracts are amortized as expense over the estimated customer relationship period of approximately . Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets, net, respectively. At September 30, 2024 the amount of deferred contract costs included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets, net was million and million, respectively. At September 30, 2023 the amount of deferred contract costs included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Deferred charges and other assets, net was million and million, respectively. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 we recognized expense of million and million, respectively, associated with the amortization of deferred contract costs within delivery and branch expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds the remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the petroleum products and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those petroleum products and services that have not yet been recognized as expenses. There have been impairment charges recognized for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. Allocation of Transaction Price to Separate Performance Obligations Our contracts with customers often include distinct performance obligations to transfer products and perform equipment maintenance services to a customer that are accounted for separately. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation for the purpose of allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations. We determine the stand-alone selling price using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs and typically have more than one stand-alone selling price for petroleum products and equipment maintenance services due to the stratification of those products and services by geography and customer characteristics. Contract Liability Balances The Company has contract liabilities for advanced payments received from customers for future oil deliveries (primarily amounts received from customers on smart pay budget payment plans in advance of oil deliveries) and obligations to service customers with equipment maintenance service contracts. Approximately of our residential customers take advantage of our smart pay budget payment plan under which their estimated annual oil and propane deliveries and service contract billings are paid for in a series of equal monthly installments. Our smart pay budget payment plans are annual and generally begin outside of the heating season. We generally have received advanced amounts from customers on smart pay budget payment plans prior to the heating season, which are reduced as oil deliveries are made. For customers that are not on smart pay budget payment plans, we generally receive the full contract amount for equipment service contracts with customers at the outset of the contracts. Contract liabilities are recognized straight-line over the service contract period, generally or less. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 the Company had contract liabilities of million and million, respectively. During the year ended September 30, 2024 the Company recognized million of revenue that was included in the September 30, 2023 contract liability balance. During the year ended September 30, 2023 the Company recognized million of revenue that was included in the September 30, 2022 contract liability balance.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company has interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate exposure to market risk associated with variable rate interest on million, or , of its long term debt. The Company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedging derivatives.

As of September 30, 2024 the fair value of the swap contracts was million. As of September 30, 2023, the notional value of the swap contracts was million and the fair value of the swap contracts was million.

As of September 30, 2024, million hedge positions or payable amounts were secured under the credit facility. The Company s Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities represent the fair value of commodity contracts used in its hedging activities that are identical and traded in active markets. The Company s Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities represent the fair value of commodity and interest rate contracts used in its hedging activities that are valued using either directly or indirectly observable inputs, whose nature, risk and class are similar. No significant transfers of assets or liabilities have been made into and out of the Level 1 or Level 2 tiers. All derivative instruments were non-trading positions and were either a Level 1 or Level 2 instrument. The Company had no Level 3 derivative instruments. The fair market value of our Level 1 and Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities are calculated by our counter-parties and are independently validated by the Company. The Company s calculations are, for Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities, based on the published New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX market prices for the commodity contracts open at the end of the period. For Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities the calculations performed by the Company are based on a combination of the NYMEX published market prices and other inputs, including such factors as present value, volatility and duration.

On September 27, 2024, the Company refinanced its term loan and the revolving credit facility with the execution of the seventh amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement (the credit agreement with a bank syndicate comprised of ten participants, which enables the Company to borrow up to million million during the heating season of December through April of each year) on a revolving credit facility for working capital purposes (subject to certain borrowing base limitations and coverage ratios), provides for a million five-year senior secured term loan Term Loan ), allows for the issuance of up to million in letters of credit, and has a maturity date of . The Company can increase the revolving credit facility size by million without the consent of the bank group. However, the bank group is not obligated to fund the million increase. If the bank group elects not to fund the increase, the Company can add additional lenders to the group, with the consent of the Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries and are secured by liens on substantially all of the Company s assets including accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles, real property, fixtures and equipment. All amounts outstanding under the credit agreement become due and payable on the facility termination date of September 27, 2029. The Term Loan is repayable in quarterly payments of million, plus an annual payment equal to of the annual Excess Cash Flow as defined in the credit agreement (an amount not to exceed million annually), less certain voluntary prepayments made during the year, with final payment at maturity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is not required to make additional term loan repayments due to Excess Cash Flow for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. In fiscal 2024, the Company repaid million of additional loan repayments due to Excess Cash Flow related to fiscal 2023. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility and the term loan is based on a margin over Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or a base rate. At September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate on the term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings was approximately and , respectively. At September 30, 2023, the effective interest rate on the term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings was approximately and , respectively. The Commitment Fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility is from December through April, and from May through November. The credit agreement requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio of if we permit Availability (as defined in the credit agreement) to be less than the greater of (a) of the Line Cap (lesser of the revolving credit facility borrowings and the borrowing base) and (b) million. In addition, as long as the Term Loan is outstanding, a senior secured leverage ratio cannot be more than as calculated as of the quarters ending June or September, and no more than as calculated as of the quarters ending December or March.

Management Incentive Compensation Plan The Company has a Management Incentive Compensation Plan the Plan ). The long-term compensation structure is intended to align the employee s performance with the long-term performance of our unitholders. Under the Plan, certain named employees who participate shall be entitled to receive a pro rata share of an amount in cash equal to: of the distributions Incentive Distributions of Available Cash in excess of the minimum quarterly distribution of per unit otherwise distributable to Kestrel Heat pursuant to the Company Agreement on account of its general partner units; and 

 of the cash proceeds (the Gains Interest which Kestrel Heat shall receive from the sale of its general partner units (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), less expenses and applicable taxes. 

 The pro rata share payable to each participant under the Plan is based on the number of participation points as described under Fiscal 2024 Compensation Decisions Management Incentive Compensation Plan. The amount paid in Incentive Distributions is governed by the Partnership Agreement and the calculation of Available Cash. To fund the benefits under the Plan, Kestrel Heat has agreed to forego receipt of the amount of Incentive Distributions that are payable to plan participants. For accounting purposes, amounts payable to management under this

during the time a participant is an employee or consultant of the Company. Following the termination of such positions, a participant s vested percentage is equal to for each full or partial year of employment or consultation with the Company starting with the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 33 1/3 in the case of the Company s chief executive officer at that time). The Company distributed to management and the general partner Incentive Distributions of approximately during fiscal 2024, during fiscal 2023, and during fiscal 2022. Included in these amounts for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, were distributions under the management incentive compensation plan of , , and , respectively, of which named executive officers received approximately during fiscal 2024, during fiscal 2023, and during fiscal 2022. With regard to the Gains Interest, Kestrel Heat has not given any indication that it will sell its general partner units within the next twelve months. Thus the Plan s value attributable to the Gains Interest currently cannot be determined. Multiemployer Pension Plans At September 30, 2024, approximately of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately of our employees are in collective bargaining agreements that are up for renewal within the next fiscal year. We contribute to various multiemployer union administered pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that provide for such plans for covered union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in that assets contributed are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the remaining participating employers may be required to bear the unfunded obligations of the plan. If we choose to stop participating in a multiemployer plan, we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability in part based on the underfunded status of the plan. The following table outlines our participation and contributions to multiemployer pension plans for the periods ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022. The EIN/Pension Plan Number column provides the Employer Identification Number EIN and the three-digit plan number. The most recent Pension Protection Act Zone Status for 2024 and 2023 relates to the plans two most recent fiscal year-ends, based on information received from the plans as reported on their Form 5500 Schedule MB. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than percent funded and are designated as critical or critical and declining, plans in the yellow zone are less than percent funded and are designated as endangered, and plans in the green zone are at least percent funded. As of September 30, 2024 the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund the NETTI Fund ), IAM National Pension, Teamsters Local 469 Pension and Local 445 Pension funds have been classified as carrying red zone status, meaning that the value of fund s assets are less than of the actuarial value of the fund s benefit obligations or have made a voluntary election. The FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan FIP or a rehabilitation plan RP is either pending or has been implemented. Certain plans have been aggregated in the All Other Multiemployer Pension Plans line of the following table, as our participation in each of these individual plans is not significant. For the Westchester Teamsters Pension Fund, Local 553 Pension Fund and Local 463 Pension Fund, we provided more than percent of the total plan contributions from all employers for 2024, 2023 and 2022, as disclosed in the respective plan s Form 5500. The collective bargaining agreements of these plans require contributions based on the hours worked and there are minimum contributions required.

Agreement with the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund In fiscal 2015, the Teamsters ratified an agreement among certain subsidiaries of the Company and the NETTI Fund, a multiemployer pension plan in which such subsidiaries participate, providing for the Company s participating subsidiaries to withdraw from the NETTI Fund s original employer pool and enter the NETTI Fund s new employer pool. The NETTI Fund includes over hundred of our current employees. The withdrawal from the original employer pool triggered an undiscounted withdrawal obligation of million that is to be paid in equal monthly installments over years, or million per year. Our status in the newly-established pool of the NETTI Fund is accounted for as participation in a new multiemployer pension plan, and therefore we recognize expense based on the contractually-required contribution for each period, and we recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid at the end of a reporting period. As of September 30, 2024 we had million and million balances included in the captions accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet representing the remaining balance of the NETTI Fund withdrawal liability. As of September 30, 2023 we had million and million balances included in the captions accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for long-term financing of a similar maturity, the fair value of the NETTI Fund withdrawal liability as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively. We utilized Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques to determine the fair value of this liability. Defined Benefit Plan Effective December 31, 2023, the Company merged its frozen defined benefit plans into plan the Plan ). The Company has no post-retirement benefit plans.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the actuarial loss was primarily due to the decrease in the weighted average discount rate relating to the frozen defined benefit plan from as of September 30, 2023 to as of September 30, 2024. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 the actuarial gain affecting the benefit obligations were not material.

The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets determined using fair value. The Company s expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is updated at least annually, taking into consideration our asset allocation, historical returns on the types of assets held, and the current economic environment. For fiscal year 2025, the Company s assumption for return on plan assets will be per annum. The discount rate used to determine net periodic pension expense for fiscal year 2024, 2023, and 2022 was , , and , respectively. The discount rate used by the Company in determining pension expense and pension obligations reflects the yield of high quality (AA or better rating by a recognized rating agency) corporate bonds whose cash flows are expected to match the timing and amounts of projected future benefit payments. The Plan s objectives are to have the ability to pay benefit and expense obligations when due, to maintain the funded ratio of the Plan, to maximize return within reasonable and prudent levels of risk in order to minimize contributions and charges to the profit and loss statement, and to control costs of administering the Plan and managing the investments of the Plan. The target asset allocation of the Plan (currently domestic fixed income and domestic equities) is based on a long-term perspective, and as the Plan gets closer to being fully funded, the allocations have been adjusted to lower volatility from equity holdings. The Company had no Level 3 pension plan assets during the two years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

In order to fully realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company s corporate subsidiaries will need to generate future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence including historical tax losses, it is more likely than not that some or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 was million. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 was million. Based upon a review of a number of factors and all available evidence, including recent historical operating performance, the expectation of sustainable earnings, and the confidence that sufficient positive taxable income will continue in all tax jurisdictions for the foreseeable future, management concludes, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the full benefit of its deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowance related to State net operating loss carryforwards at September 30, 2024. As of January 1, 2024, the Company had State tax effected net operating loss carry forwards NOLs of approximately million after consideration of valuation allowances. The State NOLs, which will expire between 2024 and 2038 , are generally available to offset any future taxable income in certain states At September 30, 2024, we did t have unrecognized income tax benefits. We file U.S. Federal income tax returns and various state and local returns. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. For our Federal income tax returns we have four tax years subject to examination. In our major state tax jurisdictions of New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania we have that are subject to examination. In the state tax jurisdiction of New Jersey we have five tax years that are subject to examination. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretation of tax law, we believe that our provision for income taxes reflect the most probable outcome. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events.

Exhibit 97 

 Star Group, L.P. 
 Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy 
 Dated October 19, 2023 
 
 The Board of Directors (the Board of Kestrel Heat, LLC (the General Partner ), the general partner of Star Group, L.P. (the Company ), has adopted this Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy (the Policy dated as of October 19, 2023, but effective for all purposes as of October 2, 2023 (the Effective Date ), which provides for the recovery of certain executive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws. This Policy is intended to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE or such other national securities exchange on which the Company s securities are listed. 
 1. Covered Executives 

This Policy applies to the Company's current and former executive officers , as such term is defined in Rule 10D-1(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the Covered Executives who served in the capacity as executive officer at any time during the performance period for receiving Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined below). The General Partner expects to designate each of the Covered Executives and notify them of their status as such on an annual basis (or more frequently in the case of any changes in the Company s officers). However, in the absence of such designation and notification, the Company officers who are required to prepare and file reports under Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be deemed Covered Executives for purposes of this Policy. 
 2. Recovery in General; Applicable Accounting Restatements 

In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company's material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements i.e. , a Big R Restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period i.e. , a little r restatement and, a Big R restatement, are collectively referred to as an Accounting Restatement ), the General Partner will cause the Company to promptly recover any erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined below) received by any Covered Executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare such an Accounting Restatement (including, where required under Section 10D of the Exchange Act, any transition period resulting from a change in the Company s fiscal year). For the avoidance of any doubt, an out-of-period adjustment when the error resulting in such out-of-period adjustment is immaterial to previously issued financial statements and is immaterial to the current period s financial statements does not qualify as an Accounting Restatement for which recovery is required under this Policy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Policy, the Company shall not be required to recover any Incentive-Based Compensation from any Covered Executive prior to such time as such person began service as an executive officer . 
 For this purpose, the date that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement shall be the earlier of (i) the date that the Board of the General Partner, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement; or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 
 For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation shall be deemed to be received by a 
 Page 1 of NUMPAGES 5 

Exhibit 97 

 Covered Executive in the Company s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure (as defined below) specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. 
 3. Incentive-Based Compensation 

For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure (as defined below). A specific example of Incentive-Based Compensation cited in the adopting release for final Rule 10D-1 (the Adopting Release is bonuses paid from a bonus pool, the size of which is determined based wholly or in part on satisfying a financial performance measure reporting goal. 
 For purposes of this Policy, Financial Reporting Measures are measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, regardless of whether such measures are presented within the Company s financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Adopting Release provides examples of Financial Reporting Measures, including the following GAAP or non-GAAP accounting-based metrics: 
 Unit price or total unitholder return 

Revenues; 

Net income; 

Operating income; 

Net assets or net asset value per unit; 

EBITDA (i.e., Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), Adjusted EBITDA and any other non-GAAP financial metrics used to determine Incentive-Based Compensation; 

Funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations; 

Liquidity measures e.g. , working capital, operating cash flow); 

Return measures e.g. , return on invested capital, return on assets, return on capital employed); 

Earnings measures e.g. , earnings per share); and 

Tax basis income. 

Based on the above definitions and examples, the Company has determined that compensation paid to the Covered Executives under the Company s Profit Sharing Plan on and after the Effective Date is subject to recovery by the Company under this Policy in the event of an Accounting Restatement. In the event that the Company adopts a compensation plan that provides for Incentive-Based Compensation, the compensation paid to the Covered Executives under such plan shall also be subject to this Policy. 
 
 Page 2 of NUMPAGES 5 

Exhibit 97 

 4. Erroneously Awarded Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery 

The amount to be recovered from a Covered Executive in the event of an Accounting Restatement shall equal the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered Executive that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid by the Covered Executive on the erroneously awarded compensation and regardless of any fault of the Covered Executive for the accounting errors that give rise to any Accounting Restatement. 
 In the case of recovery of compensation received by Covered Executives under the Profit Plan, any such recovery shall be made pro rata among the Covered Executives based on the size of the bonus received by such Covered Executive. For example, if an Accounting Restatement reduces the amount of the cash compensation pool under the Profit Plan in any fiscal year, but not below the aggregate amount the Board exercised discretion to pay out as bonuses to Covered Executives (such reduction Deficiency Amount ), then the Company shall recover from each Covered Executive an amount equal to the Deficiency Amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the dollar amount of the bonus received by a Covered Executive in respect of such fiscal year under the Profit Plan, and the denominator of which is the aggregate dollar amount of bonuses received by all employees, including the Covered Executives, in respect of such fiscal year under the Profit Plan. For the avoidance of any doubt, the Deficiency Amount shall only be satisfied by bonuses received by Covered Executives, and to the extent that the Deficiency Amount exceeds the amount of bonuses received by Covered Executives under the Profit Plan in respect of any fiscal year, the bonuses received by other Company officers and employees will not be subject to recovery or repayment under this Policy. 
 If the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the Accounting Restatement (as in the case of Incentive-Based Compensation based on unit price or total unitholder return), the General Partner shall determine such amount based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the applicable Financial Reporting Measure, and the General Partner shall maintain documentation of any such estimate and provide such documentation to the applicable securities exchange. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation from a Covered Executive to the extent that the General Partner determines that such recovery would be impracticable and either: 
 The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (determined by a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board of Directors of the General Partner after making and documenting a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, and providing documentation of such reasonable attempt to recover to the applicable securities exchange); or 

Full recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder. 

To the extent that this Policy otherwise would provide for recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation that the Company has recovered from a Covered Executive pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (or pursuant to any other recovery obligation), the amount already so recovered from such Covered Executive may be credited against the recovery otherwise required under this Policy. 
 Page 3 of NUMPAGES 5 

Exhibit 97 

 5. Method of Recovery 

The General Partner will determine, in its discretion, the method or methods for recovering any erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation hereunder, which method(s) need not be applied on a consistent basis; provided in any case that any such method provides for reasonably prompt recovery and otherwise complies with any requirements of the applicable securities exchange. Without limiting the foregoing, the methods that the General Partner, in its discretion, may determine to use to recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation hereunder may include, by way of example, the forfeiture or repayment of Incentive-Based Compensation, the forfeiture or repayment of time-based equity or cash incentive compensation awards, the forfeiture of benefits under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, and the offset of all or a portion of the amount of the erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation against other compensation payable to the Covered Executive, including any non-erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation. 
 6. No Indemnification or Insurance 

The Company shall not indemnify nor insure any Covered Executive against the loss of any erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation. 
 7. Administration 

This Policy shall be administered by the Board of the General Partner. Except for determinations of whether recovery under this Policy is impracticable (which determination must be made by a majority of the independent directors of the Board), the Board is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the NYSE and any other national securities exchange on which the Company's securities are listed. 
 8. Effective Date 

This Policy shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall apply to Incentive-Based Compensation that is received by a Covered Executive on or after that date. 
 9. Amendment; Termination 

The General Partner may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect the final regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with any final rules or standards adopted by the NYSE or any other national securities exchange on which the Company's securities are listed. The General Partner may terminate this Policy at any time. 
 10. Policy Not Exclusive 

The General Partner may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery, recoupment, forfeiture or offset that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any other applicable Company policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. 
 Page 4 of NUMPAGES 5 

Exhibit 97 

 11. Successors 

This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives. 
 12. Filings 

The General Partner shall cause the Company to make any filings with, or submissions to, the Securities Exchange Commission, the NYSE and any other national securities exchange that may be required pursuant to rules adopted pursuant to Section 10D of the Exchange Act.
