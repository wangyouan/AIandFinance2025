Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make concerning the financial condition and results of operations and our expectations as to our future growth, prospects, financial outlook and business strategy, and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Although such statements are based on management s current estimates and expectations and/or currently available competitive, financial, and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. We caution the reader that there are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: 
 general economic conditions, including inflation and the actions taken by monetary authorities in response to inflation, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in capital markets and stock market volatility, instability in the banking industry, labor shortages, or the impact of a possible recession or economic downturn or changes to monetary or fiscal policies or priorities in the U.S. and the countries where we do business on our results, prospects and opportunities; 
 competition from existing and future competitors in our target markets, as well as the possible reduction in demand for certain of our product solutions and services, including delays in the timing of the award of projects or reduction in funding, or the abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to the financial condition of our clients and suppliers or due to governmental budget constraints or changes to governmental budgetary priorities, or the inability of our clients to meet their payment obligations in a timely manner or at all; 
 our ability to fully execute on our corporate strategy, including (i) uncertainties as to the impact of the completed Separation Transaction (as defined below) on our business, such as a possible impact on our credit profile or our ability to operate as a separate public-company without the benefit of the resources and capabilities divested as part of the SpinCo Business (as defined below), the possibility that the Separation Transaction will not result in the intended benefits to us or our shareholders, that we will not realize the value expected to be derived from the disposition of our retained stake in Amentum (as defined below), or that we will incur unexpected costs, charges or expenses related to the provision of transition services in connection with the Separation Transaction, (ii) the impact of acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other strategic events resulting from evolving business strategies, including on our ability to maintain our culture and retain key personnel, customers or suppliers, or our ability to achieve the cost-savings and synergies contemplated by our recent acquisitions within the expected time frames or to achieve them fully and to successfully integrate acquired businesses while retaining key personnel , and (iii) our ability to invest in the tools needed to implement our strategy; 
 financial market risks that may affect us, including by affecting our access to capital, the cost of such capital and/or our funding obligations under defined benefit pension and post retirement plans; 
 legislative changes, including potential changes to the amounts provided for, under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as well as other legislation related to governmental spending, and changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances, including the impact of, and changes to, tariffs or trade policies that may adversely impact our future financial position or results of operations; 
 increased geopolitical uncertainty and risks, including policy risks and potential civil unrest, relating to the outcome of elections across our key markets and elevated geopolitical tension and conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts and the escalating tensions in the Middle East, among others; and 
 the impact of any pandemic, and any resulting economic downturn on our results, prospects and opportunities, measures or restrictions imposed by governments and health officials in response to the pandemic, as well as the inability of governments in certain of the countries in which we operate to effectively mitigate the financial or other impacts of any future pandemics or infectious disease outbreaks on their economies and workforces and our operations therein. 
 The foregoing factors and potential future developments are inherently uncertain, unpredictable and, in many cases, beyond our control. For a description of these and additional factors that may occur that could cause actual results

 Item 1. BUSINESS 
 At Jacobs, our foundation guides us to create a more connected and sustainable world. 
 We are challenging today to reinvent tomorrow delivering outcomes and solutions for the world s most complex challenges. With a team of approximately 45,000, we provide end-to-end services in advanced manufacturing, cities places, energy, environmental, life sciences, transportation and water. From advisory and consulting, feasibility, planning, design, program and lifecycle management, we are creating a more connected and sustainable world. 
 
 Whether tackling water scarcity, aging infrastructure, access to life-saving therapies or sophisticated cyberattacks, we take on some of the world s biggest challenges, bringing a different way of thinking to everything we do. We channel our creativity, agility and our domain expertise to create value for our clients and society. 
 
 Over the last eight years, Jacobs has been on a transformation journey, starting with a re-emphasis on business excellence, our culture and brand, and evolving our portfolio to become a science-based consulting and advisory solutions provider focused on delivering some of the world s most complex sustainability, critical infrastructure and advanced manufacturing challenges. This transformation included acquiring a 65 stake in PA Consulting Group Limited ("PA Consulting") in fiscal 2021. Acquisitions of BlackLynx and StreetLight further positioned us as a leader in high-value critical infrastructure and technology-enabled solutions. 
 
 We began trading under the new ticker symbol J on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2019, and in March 2021 our Global Industry Classifications Standard code changed to Research Consulting Services. Our Focus 2023 Transformation Office drove further innovation, delivering value-creating solutions for our clients and leveraging an integrated digital and technology strategy to improve our efficiency and effectiveness, ultimately freeing up valuable time and resources for reinvestment in our people. 
 
 Boldly Moving Forward 
 
 Page 4 

In March 2022, Jacobs launched a three-year strategy, building on our success over the preceding three years to take advantage of a new lens crafted from the incredible pace of change in the world and in our markets. We are focused now on broadening our leadership in high growth sectors aligned with long-term secular trends, such as infrastructure renewal and investment, and the global transition to more sustainable ways of living. 
 
 Our strategy is driven by our visionary purpose of creating a more connected, sustainable world, applying our values and delivering on our brand promise of Challenging today. Reinventing tomorrow. To help us challenge the accepted and shape the new standards our future needs, our three growth accelerators Climate Response, Consulting Advisory and Data Solutions services create connections between the global market trends, our client solutions and our company purpose. Our growth accelerators are delivering significant value for our clients, positioning Jacobs for high-margin growth while advancing sustainability and social value in our communities. 
 
 Our Climate Response accelerator focuses on the end-to-end solutions we co-create with clients in energy transition, decarbonization, adaptation and resilience, and regenerative and nature-based climate solutions. Today our clients are facing a rapidly changing world - navigating multifaceted challenges such as the increasing pace of technological change, budget and supply chain limitations, global climate change events and complex geopolitical conditions. Through our Consulting Advisory capabilities, we deepen our involvement with our clients to help them conceptualize, shape and realize their future. 
 
 Our Data Solutions accelerator harnesses our data and digital capabilities, products and tools to help our clients operate more efficiently in a safe environment and capitalize on their data more than ever before. We invest in technology-enhanced and AI solutions to help clients find better, safer and more agile ways of working. We provide solutions in data analytics and insights, digital architecture, advisory and transformation, software development and cybersecurity and operational technology. 

Prior to the Separation Transaction, the Company's four operating segments were comprised of its two global lines of business ("LOBs"): Critical Mission Solutions ("CMS") and People Places and Solutions ("P PS"), its business unit Divergent Solutions ("DVS") and its majority investment in PA Consulting. After the Separation, we reorganized P PS and our remaining DVS businesses into a more streamlined operating model, Infrastructure Advanced Facilities ("I AF"), which enables our collective business teams to collaborate more horizontally. Our CMS LOB and portions of DVS which were included in the separation are now reported as discontinued operations. 
 
 Our next strategy will build upon the foundation laid by our current strategy and will be outlined at our next Investor Day in 2025. 
 Our Values in Action 
 Jacobs' Ethics and Code of Conduct are rooted in our values and provide the standards and support to help us successfully navigate issues, make the right decisions and conduct our business with the integrity that reflects our heritage and ethical reputation. We hold our suppliers and business partners to the same standards. 
 Page 5 

Our purpose is to create a more connected, sustainable world. We know that through our client solutions and the way we operate our business we can prepare our world for the complex, interconnected global challenges it faces, while positively impacting what is possible today and in the future. PlanBeyond integrates sustainability throughout our operations and client solutions planning beyond today for a more sustainable future. 
 
 We recognize our greatest opportunity for impact is through our client solutions, and we are focused on how our clients deliver positive impact and build resilience. To enable this, we offer wide-ranging sustainability capabilities, including global, cross-market expertise in decarbonization greenhouse gas management; adaptation resilience; sustainable built environments; social value equity; nature positive solutions; and energy transition. We are continually adapting PlanBeyond to manage risk, seize opportunity and create positive outcomes and will share our updated PlanBeyond priorities on our website in fiscal 2025. 
 
 Driving positive impact 
 
 Through our client portfolio and our own operations, we focus on creating positive social and economic impacts while protecting the environment and improving resilience. 
 
 Climate Response is one of three growth accelerators within our fiscal 2022 to 2024 Company Strategy aligning positive societal impact with long-term business growth. One of our key ambitions is to achieve net zero across the value chain by 2040. Our net-zero target is approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, and our carbon neutrality status is in line with the international standard PAS 2060. As part of our Carbon Neutrality Commitment, we achieved 100 low-carbon electricity, and we became carbon neutral for our operations and business travel in 2020. By 2025, we aim for 65 of our purchased goods and services supplier spending to go to those with science-based targets. Our Climate Action Plan will be updated to a Climate Transition Plan in 2025. 
 
 We have invested in technology to enhance virtual collaboration and help mitigate business travel and employee commuting carbon emissions. We also invested in tools and partnerships to help our people consider when business travel is essential and make more sustainable choices when it is necessary. 
 
 Our digital solutions help our clients with critical project sustainability decisions by assessing climate risks, carbon impacts, and system vulnerabilities. In fiscal 2025, we will deploy our Evolve tool, which generates recommendations to embed sustainability in all Jacobs projects to enhance their positive impact and resilience. 
 
 Transparency and accountability 
 
 Businesses worldwide are experiencing an increase in stakeholder expectations, expanding sustainability regulations and reporting requirements, and greater demand for corporate transparency and accountability. We report our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance annually, following the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and informed by Global Reporting Initiative standards. 
 
 Launched in fiscal 2023, Jacobs Sustainability Linked Bonds (SLBs) further reflect how we are incorporating sustainability into the Company's financing strategy, with the SLBs' interest rate underpinned by two Key Performance Indicators one linked to Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities (UN SDG 5 and UN SDG 10) and the other to Climate Action (UN SDG 13). 
 
 Shaping Tomorrow s Communities 
 
 Around the world, we work with our clients, partners and supply chains to create solutions that positively impact how people live, move and thrive in the world driving a more equitable distribution of benefits for communities. 
 
 Page 6 

We invest in local communities globally, collaborating with charities and not-for-profit organizations to make a positive impact and live our values. Through Collectively , our global giving and volunteering program, employees are empowered to engage with charities and community organizations aligned with our values and strategic causes. We provide employee benefits for donation matching, grant nominations, paid volunteer time and volunteer rewards. We support communities devastated by events including natural and climate-related disasters, water security and scarcity, and the impacts of conflicts around the world. Our employees drive further impact through our science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education and engagement programs enabling sustainability learning among young people. 
 
 In fiscal 2024, we donated over 3.2 million to 2,600+ charities across 23 countries. Our people tracked approximately 18,000 volunteer hours including nearly 9,000 STEAM volunteer hours. (1) 
 
 Social Value and Equity Advisory in our Client Solutions 
 
 We integrate social value and equity considerations into our client solutions. We help clients realize social value opportunities through their projects and services by embedding and measuring social, economic and environmental benefit generation in what they do. Our blueprint for creating social value through infrastructure investment enables us to help clients contribute to a more inclusive economy and equitable society. 
 
 Social value is a fast-evolving field, and its successful delivery requires a wide range of specialisms. Our fully owned subsidiary Simetrica-Jacobs specializes in social value, wellbeing research and impact evaluation measuring, quantifying and monetizing impacts to help directly inform both investment decisions and delivery models, and ensuring impact is generated where it is needed most. Simetrica-Jacobs deploys internationally endorsed methods set out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and government-produced guidelines, including the U.K. Government s HM Treasury Green Book. 
 
 We help clients understand how they can transform local, city and regional decision-making identifying innovative, inclusive and ethical investments that will drive social change, spread prosperity and meet the growing challenges facing communities. 
 (1) This data includes Jacobs' continuing and discontinued operations (excluding PA Consulting). 
 We maintain agile and disciplined capital deployment

 Separation of Critical Mission Solutions (CMS) and Cyber Intelligence (C I) 
 On September 27, 2024, Jacobs Solutions Inc. ("Jacobs") completed the previously announced Reverse Morris Trust transaction pursuant to which (i) Jacobs first transferred its Critical Mission Solutions business CMS and portions of the Divergent Solutions DVS business (referred to herein as the Cyber Intelligence business C I and together with CMS referred to as the SpinCo Business ), to Amazon Holdco Inc., a Delaware corporation, which has been renamed Amentum Holdings, Inc. SpinCo (the Separation ), (ii) Jacobs then effectuated a spin-off of SpinCo by distributing 124,084,108 shares of SpinCo common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the SpinCo Common Stock ), by way of a pro rata distribution to its shareholders such that each holder of shares of Jacobs common stock, par value 1.00 per share, (the Jacobs Common Stock was entitled to receive one share of SpinCo Common Stock for each share of Jacobs common stock held as of the record date, September 23, 2024 (the Distribution ), and (iii) finally, Amentum Parent Holdings LLC merged with and into SpinCo, with SpinCo surviving the merger (the Merger and together with the Separation and the Distribution, the Separation Transaction ).

 As a result of the Separation Transaction, substantially all SpinCo Business-related assets and liabilities have been separated and distributed (the "Disposal Group"). The Company determined that the Disposal Group should be reported as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations because their disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on operations and financial results. As such, the financial results of the SpinCo Business are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, current and non-current assets and liabilities of the Disposal Group are reflected as held for spin in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 29, 2023. Further, as the Separation Transaction closed on September 27, 2024, no amounts remained held for spin at the end of fiscal 2024. See Note 14- Discontinued Operations . 
 
 Prior to the Separation Transaction, Jacobs Critical Mission Solutions line of business provided a full spectrum of solutions for clients to address evolving challenges like digital transformation and modernization, national security and defense, space exploration, digital asset management, the clean energy transition, and nuclear decommissioning and cleanup. Clients included the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the Combatant Commands, the U.S. Intelligence Community, NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE), EDF Nuclear Generation, the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the U.K. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), and the Australian Department of Defence, as well as private sector clients mainly in the aerospace, automotive, motorsports, energy and telecom sectors. Prior to the Separation Transaction, the DVS business unit served as the core foundation for developing and delivering innovative, next-generation cloud, cyber, data and digital technologies. DVS clients included government agencies and commercial clients in the U.S. and international markets. Certain portions of the DVS business were retained and are now part of I AF.

Significant Customers 
 The following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government for each of the last three fiscal years: 
 2024 2023 2022 10 9 8 
 Given the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the U.S. federal government, the loss of U.S. federal government agencies as customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. For more information on risks relating to our government contracts, see Item 1A - Risk Factors. 
 Contracts 
 While there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake, our contracts generally fall into two broad categories: cost-reimbursable and fixed-price. The following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last three fiscal years: 
 2024 2023 2022 Cost-reimbursable 69 70 71 Fixed-price, limited risk 31 26 24 Fixed-price, at risk 4 5 
 In accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts (including those with the U.S. federal government) are subject to termination at the discretion of the client, which is discussed in greater detail in Item 1A - Risk Factors . In such situations, our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination. 
 Cost-Reimbursable Contracts 
 Cost-reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. The profit element may be in the form of a simple mark-up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee, or a combination of a mark-up and a fee. The fee element can also take several forms, including 1) a fixed amount, 2) an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or 3) an incentive fee based on targets, milestones, or performance factors defined in the contract. 
 Fixed-Price Contracts 
 Fixed-price contracts include both lump sum bid contracts and negotiated fixed-price contracts. Under lump sum bid contracts, we typically bid against competitors based on client-furnished specifications. This type of pricing presents certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies, and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Additionally, it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients, which is contrary to our relationship-based business model. Accordingly, lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract. In contrast, under a negotiated fixed-price contract, we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client and frequently exists in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project. Thus, although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client, the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us in our services contracts as well as construction. However, because of economies that may be realized during the contract term, both negotiated fixed-price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts. The Company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts. In recent years, most of our fixed-price work has been either negotiated fixed-price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for design and/or project services, rather than turnkey construction.

Competition 
 We compete with many companies across the world including technology, consulting and engineering firms. Typically, no single company or companies dominate the markets in which we provide services, and often we partner with our competitors or other companies to jointly pursue projects. AECOM, Tetra Tech, WSP, Arcadis, Bechtel, Arup, Mott MacDonald, Stantec, Parsons, Accenture, Schneider Electric, Mace, AtkinsRealis, Altair, Montrose, Capgemini, Fluor, IBM, Infosys, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC, Bain Company, BCG and McKinsey Company are some of our competitors. We compete based on the following factors, among others: technical capabilities, reputation for quality, price of services, safety record, availability of qualified personnel, and ability to timely perform work and contract terms. 
 Our People and Our Culture 
 
 Our culture and our people driving it are what truly defines Jacobs. Authentic leadership and a commitment to living our core values every day creates a culture of trust, respect and empowerment across our business to help us deliver the best outcomes for all our stakeholders. Together, we deliver extraordinary solutions for a better tomorrow and live by our employee value statement: "Jacobs. A world where you can." Our strategy further connects our people to our purpose and helps us continue to evolve our culture to support, empower and enable our talent to thrive. 
 
 Attracting and Growing our Talent 
 
 Jacobs success is dependent on our ability to hire, retain, engage and leverage highly qualified employees, across the full spectrum of technical, professional, scientific and consulting disciplines. 
 
 As of September 27, 2024, we had a workforce of approximately 45,000 people worldwide, including a contingent workforce of approximately 1,900 people. This represents a decrease of 32 in our total workforce year-over-year - reflecting the spin-off of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber Intelligence government services businesses, where we transitioned approximately a third of our employees to Amentum. Though the separation represented a challenge, we completed the separation while reducing our voluntary employee turnover rate to 9.6 - truly a testament to our strong culture and the commitment of our people. The breakdown of our employees by region is as follows: 

By fostering learning and unlocking career opportunities for our people, we attract and retain the best talent to deliver for our clients and fuel long-term growth for Jacobs. Our employee programs, global learning resources and technology help our people collaborate, grow and develop careers in a supportive, high-performing workplace. 
 Page 12 

Our unique employee experience platform e3: engage. excel. elevate. enables our employees to develop through continuous feedback and celebrations, aligning priorities, learning new skills and increasing knowledge. With more than 32,000 training programs, the e3 Learning platform makes learning and development opportunities easily accessible for our people and we have expanded micro learnings directly into the employee inbox based on their development needs. 
 
 Our new Living our Values series is a self-paced, mandatory learning experience on the platform tailored to help our people embody Jacobs' values daily. The modules encompass caring for colleagues, clients and communities while emphasizing our collective responsibility to shape, impact and transform our culture. 
 
 As we advance our digital and data solutions to help clients work better and safer, we are empowering our people to improve digital skills and leverage resources. We are developing our proprietary AI tool, Jacobs AI, to make our authoritative knowledge more discoverable and usable for our people to enhance and support daily work. We also launched a new training series on sustainability and resilience with modules tailored to different business areas, offering practical insights and guidance. 
 
 Our global graduate development program and our local apprenticeships equip our next generation of professionals with the skills, networks and knowledge for a successful career at Jacobs. We provide our interns with practical, relevant real life experience to help support their professional goals. In fiscal 2024, we welcomed nearly 1,500 graduates, interns and apprentices to our global team. 
 
 Our people can pursue different careers and lifelong professional opportunities at Jacobs. We promote agile careers and continuous development for our employees, supporting a variety of different career paths. As an employer of choice for diverse talent, these programs enable us to bring more innovative thought and solutions into our teams to support our clients. 
 
 Having established a baseline for our organizational health with a comprehensive Culture Survey in 2021, we conduct shorter, periodic pulse surveys with employees to continually evaluate progress in priority areas and identify new opportunities for growth. We continue to see strong levels of employee engagement throughout our business. In fiscal 2024, we included culture survey questions within our new Living our Values course focused on inclusion and belonging. 
 
 We foster and encourage robust mentoring. Employees can request a mentor through e3 in our mentor match programs. In addition, our eight Jacobs Employee Networks (JENs) offer mentoring programs that connect members with leaders who understand the unique challenges of their journeys and provide insight and guidance for those looking to elevate their careers. 
 
 Focus on Inclusion and Diversity 
 
 We continue to grow and nurture our TogetherBeyond culture, our approach to living inclusion every day and enabling diversity and equity globally. Our focus has always been on inclusion first, with one of our four values being We live inclusion. By creating a culture of inclusion, diversity follows. Integral to our strategy and how our culture continues to evolve, our TogetherBeyond approach supports a workplace where we embrace different perspectives our people are more creative and innovative as a result, which benefits our clients. We know that if our people feel connected and valued and that they belong, then there is no limit to who they can be and what we can achieve together. Whether connecting through our eight Jacobs Employee Networks (JENs), one of our 220+ Communities of Practice, or in other ways, our people collaborate and drive pivotal initiatives within Jacobs that create an inclusive workplace for our globally diverse employee population. 
 
 We focus on important topics like equality, conscious inclusion and allyship. In addition to providing training and resources, our employee networks and other internal communities foster meaningful conversations on these topics. Our people help attract new talent, shape our recruitment strategies, and improve our science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM) programs and our accessibility practices.

Our employee networks: 

Tangible leadership commitment and accountability help drive our culture at Jacobs. At fiscal year-end 2024, after giving effect to changes to our Board related to the Separation Transaction, our Board's independent directors were 50 diverse (race and gender), and our Executive Leadership Team was 80 diverse, based on self-reported data. 
 
 Each year, our people leaders commit to meaningful inclusion and diversity (I D) actions. Inclusive behaviors are part of our leaders performance reviews, and all leaders at Vice President level and above are encouraged to mentor junior members of staff, including those from diverse backgrounds. This framework supports our essential I D priorities such as recruiting and developing veteran talent, ensuring equity for our LGBTQ+ community, and creating an inclusive environment for people living with disabilities. Our female representation at Vice Presidents and above level in fiscal 2024 is 34 and based on merit. 
 
 An important component of our priorities is our Be Seen @ Jacobs data disclosure campaign which allows employees globally to confidentially and voluntarily report their demographic data. This improves our data reporting, giving us a holistic overview of our workforce and helping us identify and address existing pay gaps or inequities. 
 
 As of September 27, 2024, our U.S. employees had the following race and ethnicity demographics based on self-reported data: 

Page 14 

Total U.S. diversity (ethnicity female) was 52 (excludes contingent workers and craft employees). 
 
 As of September 27, 2024, our global employees had the following gender demographics based on self-reported data: 

In fiscal 2024, our U.S. university hiring demographics show hires of 41 female, 54 male, and 5 undisclosed or non-binary gender, as well as 43 ethnically diverse employees. Overall U.S. hiring at Jacobs is at 40 for ethnically diverse employees (excludes contingent workers and craft employees) in 2024. 
 
 We work with small or disadvantaged businesses across the globe, inclusive of minority and veteran-owned businesses. 
 
 Our Employees Wellbeing and Resilience 
 
 We believe in a comprehensive approach to our employees resilience that integrates physical, emotional, financial and social wellbeing. Our global wellbeing programs, tools and benefits for our people and their families give them the resources and support they need to be at their best. Origin, our global financial counseling benefit is designed to help our employees manage their finances confidently and be financially resilient. Additionally, our partnership with Carrot brings free fertility healthcare and family-forming benefits for all paths to parenthood and provides support for menopause, low testosterone and more. 
 
 Page 15 

In fiscal 2024, we partnered with RethinkCare to provide our people with a free parental success solution and neurodiversity training benefit. We also expanded our flexible working arrangements to ensure our people have the time they need to balance commitments. Furthering our commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive workplace, we extended the reach of our Disabilities and Reasonable Adjustment policies to better support differently abled individuals to participate fully in their employment. 
 
 Organizationally, as global challenges to our security, wellbeing and ability to operate evolve, we stay focused on managing risks effectively and building our resilience by leveraging our Culture of Caring to deliver the best outcomes for our people, the environment and our company. Our BeyondZero program continues to drive a safer, more secure, healthier, and more resilient future for our people, our communities and the environment. We are proud to have demonstrated safety excellence with another year of zero employee fatalities at work and a total recordable incident rate 1 of 0.17, compared to the North American Industry Classification System s most recently reported 2 aggregate rate of 0.6. 
 
 We also support the emotional resilience of our people and communities through Jacobs "One Million Lives" initiative, where we offer a free, accessible mental health check-in tool and resources enabling users to check their mental health and access proactive strategies for personal mental health development. More than 47,000 OML check-ins have been completed since its launch in December 2020 to fiscal year end 2024. Our e3 Learning platform empowers employees with self-guided learning opportunities in wellbeing and related topics. To support continued mental wellbeing, we have a network of dedicated Positive Mental Health Leads and an employee volunteer community of 1,900 Positive Mental Health Champions, with one in every twenty one employees being an active champion. From early career employees through to senior and executive leaders, these champions promote positive mental health across the organization and are a point of reference for information and resources on where to find mental health support. 
 
 Our business continuity program to assure business delivery and resilience continues to demonstrate its effectiveness in an ever-changing operational environment. Jacobs Strategic Risk Analysis program identifies, collects and analyzes threat intelligence and provides reporting for effective guidance and operational and strategic business decision-making. Despite numerous climate-related and other global events, Jacobs has successfully maintained business continuity. 
 
 Our enhanced Global Travel Assistance program in partnership with our Global Assistance Response provider, International SOS, helps keep our employees safe and healthy while traveling or on assignment outside their home country. 
 
 In the challenging global circumstances, we stay committed to humanitarian efforts that support natural and climate-related disaster recovery and relief campaigns, water security and scarcity, and the impacts of conflicts around the world. Our employees actively support humanitarian relief through Collectively , our global giving and volunteering program, which enables them to engage with charities and community organizations aligned with our values and strategic causes. We provide employee benefits for donation matching, grant nominations, paid volunteer time and volunteer rewards.

 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 We operate in a changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 Summary Risk Factors 
 The following is a summary of some of the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below. 
 Risks Related to Our Operations 
 We engage in a highly competitive business. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 
 Our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the award of these contracts and economic conditions. Demand for our services may be impacted by continuing inflation, rising or continued high interest rates, and/or construction costs. 
 Project sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. Failure to maintain safe work sites exposes us to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. 
 The nature of our contracts, particularly any fixed-price contracts, subjects us to risks of cost overruns. We may experience losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or the project experiences delays. 
 Our failure to meet performance requirements or contractual schedules could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, canceled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily an accurate representation of our future revenues or earnings. 
 The outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and damage our reputation. Our services expose us to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage. 
 A reduction in the amount of available governmental funding could materially affect our results of operations. 
 We are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. 
 Employee, agent or partner misconduct, or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations, could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. 
 Cybersecurity or privacy breaches, or systems and information technology interruption or failure could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to contractual penalties, significant financial losses and/or reputational harm. 
 Our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. 
 Our benefit plan expenses and obligations may fluctuate depending on various factors, including inflation, changes in levels of interest rates, and pension plan asset performance. 
 Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control. 
 Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel while managing the risks associated with sustained remote working arrangements. 
 Any harm to our reputation or relationships with government agencies could decrease the amount of business that government agencies do with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our focus on new growth areas entails risks, including those associated with new relationships, clients, talent needs, capabilities, service offerings, and maintaining our collaborative culture and core values. 
 If we, or our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments, lose, or experience a significant reduction in, business from one or a few large customers, it could have a material adverse impact on us. 
 Page 18 

Risks Related to International Operations 
 Our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. 
 Foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects. 
 Our global presence could give rise to material fluctuations in our income tax rates. 
 Risks Related to the Separation Transaction 
 We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation Transaction, and the Separation Transaction may adversely impact our business and results of operation. 
 The Separation Transaction could result in a significant tax liability if the terms of the private letter ruling are not satisfied. 
 Risks Related to Acquisitions, Investments, Joint Ventures and Divestitures 
 Our use of joint ventures, partnerships and strategic investments in entities exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. 
 An impairment charge on our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
 Our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions and strategic investments to sustain our growth and we may make minority investments as well, all of which present certain risks and uncertainties. 
 Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance 
 Past and future non-financial environmental, health, and safety-related laws and regulations could impose significant additional costs and liabilities. 
 If we fail to comply with any governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. 
 We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. 
 Risks Related to Climate Change and ESG 
 Climate change and related environmental issues, including market or regulatory responses to climate change, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be unable to achieve our climate commitments and targets. 
 Increasing scrutiny and changing and conflicting expectations from governmental organizations, clients, investors, suppliers and partners, communities and our employees with respect to our ESG and diversity and inclusion-related practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Credit Markets 
 We rely in part on liquidity from our credit facilities to fund our business. Restrictions in our credit facilities and other indebtedness could adversely impact our business. Our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit. 
 Maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully win some contracts. 
 Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase and our net income and cash flows to correspondingly decrease . 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Corporate Structure 
 Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. 
 There can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock. 
 In the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership, and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture, the value of stock is subject to fluctuation. 
 We are a holding company. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries. We depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us to fund our operations. 
 Page 19 

Risks Related to Our Operations 
 We engage in a highly competitive business. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 
 We face intense competition to provide technical, professional and construction management services to clients. The markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional, national and multinational companies. The extent and type of our competition varies by industry, geographic area and project type. Our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive procurement process. We are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing, schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services. Competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, which increases the risk that, among other things, we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we have seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the award of these contracts. 
 Our revenues depend on new contract awards. Delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such projects as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our long-term projected results. It is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive large-scale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex procurement and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals. Since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. Furthermore, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and, as a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project. 
 The uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. In some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. When an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Demand for our services is impacted by economic downturns, reductions in private or government spending and times of political uncertainty. 
 We provide full spectrum technical and professional solutions to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries, including programs for various national, state and local governments, including advanced manufacturing, cities places, energy, environmental, life sciences, transportation, water and other general industrial and consumer businesses and sectors. These sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty. Consequently, our results have varied, and may continue to vary, depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate. 
 Uncertain global economic, socioeconomic and political conditions may negatively impact our clients ability and willingness to fund their projects, including their ability to raise capital and pay, or timely pay, our invoices. These factors may also cause our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services. For example, in the public sector, declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. In addition, under such conditions, many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. These conditions may reduce the demand for our services, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Page 20 

Additionally, uncertain economic, socioeconomic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. We cannot predict the outcome of changing trade policies or other unanticipated socioeconomic or political conditions, nor can we predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients markets. In addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, during any such period we may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. Weak economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry, our business may be disproportionately affected by regional conflicts, negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries. 
 Continuing inflation and rising interest rates and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts. 
 Continuing or renewed inflation and rising interest rates and/or construction costs (including supply chain issues) could reduce the demand for our services. In addition, we bear all of the risk of high inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. Because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 69 during fiscal 2024 ), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. However, if we continue to experience inflationary pressures, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future, particularly if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent. Therefore, continued or renewed inflation, rising interest rates and/or construction costs and supply chain challenges and/or frustrations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Project sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. Failure to maintain safe work sites by us, the owner or others working at the project site can lead to our employees or others becoming injured, disabled or even losing their lives, and exposes us to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. 
 Project sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes and hazardous and highly regulated materials, in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations. We may be expressly responsible for safety on some project sites, and, accordingly, we have an obligation to implement effective safety procedures at such sites. The failure by us or others working at such sites to implement safety procedures or the implementation of ineffective procedures, or the failure to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures, subjects our employees and others to the risk of injury, disability or loss of life, and subjects us to risk that the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating and insurance costs. 
 We are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. Although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective HSE work procedures throughout our organization, including project sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to fines as well as criminal and/or civil liability. In addition, despite the work of our functional groups, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work, equipment or supplies. 
 Our safety record is critical to our reputation. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. 
 For all of the foregoing reasons, if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards, we could suffer harm to our reputation, reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The nature of our contracts, particularly any fixed-price contracts, subjects us to risks of cost overruns. We may experience reduced profits or losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or the project experiences delays. 
 For fiscal 2024, approximately 31.1 of our revenues were earned under fixed-price contracts. Both fixed-price and many cost-reimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance. For fixed-price contracts, we may benefit from any cost-savings, but we bear greater risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. Fixed-price contracts are established in part on proposed designs, which may be partial or incomplete, cost 
 Page 21 

and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, commodity and other materials pricing and cost and availability of labor (including the cost of any related benefits or entitlements), equipment and materials and other exigencies. Cost overruns can occur, leading to reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project for a variety of reasons, including if the design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather, supply chain or other delays beyond our control, changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials, our vendors or subcontractors inability or failure to perform, or changes in general economic conditions and inflationary pressures. We may present change orders and claims to our clients, subcontractors and vendors for, among other things, additional costs exceeding the original contract price. If we fail to properly document the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors and vendors, we will likely incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, could result in a loss for a project. These risks are exacerbated for projects with long-term durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs. The occurrence of significant costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our failure to meet performance requirements or contractual schedules could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer. As a result, we often incur significant costs for engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer, which may impact our liquidity. In some circumstances, we may incur penalties if we do not achieve project completion by a scheduled date. In some cases, the occurrence of delays may be due to factors outside of our control, such as due to supply chain shortages. 
 Our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted. Like fixed-price contracts, the expected cost of cost-reimbursable projects is based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts. A portion of the fee is often linked to these estimates and the related final cost and schedule objectives, and if for whatever reason these objectives are not met, the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses. 
 The contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, canceled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily an accurate representation of our future revenues or earnings. 
 Backlog represents estimates of the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. As of the end of fiscal 2024, our backlog totaled approximately 21.8 billion. There is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts, including our U.S. government work, are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client, and may be subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided, as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. In the event of a project cancellation, we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. Projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. The risk of contracts in backlog being canceled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices. 
 In some markets, there is a continuing trend toward cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. Typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria. If we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. 
 Page 22 

Contracts with the U.S. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks compared to contracts with private sector clients. 
 The U.S. federal government represented approximately 10 of our total revenue in fiscal 2024. These contracts, which are an important source of our revenue and profit, are subject to additional risks compared to contracts with private sector clients: 
 Some of our contracts are long-term government contracts, which are only funded on an annual basis. In addition, public-supported financing, such as state and local municipal bonds, may be only partially raised at the beginning of a program, with additional funding normally only committed as appropriations are made in each fiscal year. If appropriations for funding are not made in subsequent years of a multiple-year contract, we may not be able to realize all of our anticipated revenue and profits from that project. U.S. government shutdowns or any related under-staffing of the government departments or agencies that interact with our business could result in program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders, could limit the government s ability to effectively progress programs and make timely payments, and could limit our ability to perform on our existing U.S. government contracts and successfully compete for new work. Governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. The U.S. government may also shift its spending focus toward areas in which we do not currently provide services. 
 Our contracts with governmental agencies are subject to audit, investigations and proceedings which could result in adjustments to reimbursable contract costs or, if we are charged with wrongdoing, possible temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government programs, and a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. 
 Governmental agencies may modify, curtail or terminate our contracts at any time prior to their completion and, if we do not replace them, we may suffer a decline in revenue. In addition, for some assignments, the U.S. government may attempt to insource the services to government employees rather than outsource to a contractor. 
 Most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process, which may emphasize price over other qualitative factors. The U.S. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive procurement process for each task order issued under a contract. This process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. 
 We may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. 
 Government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. For example, for contracts with the U.S. federal government, we must comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards, and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices. Government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. This includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations. 
 Many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. If our employees or our facilities are unable to obtain or retain the necessary security clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 
 These various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by government authorities as well as profit and cost controls, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our services expose us to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage. 
 We provide services that are subject to professional standards and qualifications, including providing services that are based on our professional engineering expertise, as well as our other professional credentials. These services must comply with various professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of such services. Our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. We also issue reports 
 Page 23 

and opinions to clients based on our professional expertise, such as issuing opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. While we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, we may be deemed to be responsible for these professional judgments, recommendations or opinions if they are later determined to be inaccurate, or if a catastrophic event or other failure occurs at one of our project sites or completed projects. Any unfavorable legal ruling against us could result in substantial monetary damages, disqualification to perform services in the future, or even criminal violations. 
 Such events could result in significant professional liability, general liability or product liability and warranty or other claims against us that could be highly publicized and have reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. We could also be liable to third parties, including through class actions, even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. Further, even where coverage applies, the policies have limits and deductibles or retentions or quota shares, which could result in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us. In addition, indemnification from clients or subcontractors may not be available. An uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a policy limit, high deductible and/or retention or quota share, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and damage our reputation. 
 We are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business, including litigation inherited through acquisitions. Since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures at any such facility or project can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, and expose us to substantial claims and litigation and investigations relating to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, or pollution and environmental damage. We can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. In many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors and vendors, we agree to retain or assume specified liabilities for damages, penalties, losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. In addition, while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us. 
 With a workforce of approximately 45,000 people globally, we are also party to labor and employment claims in the normal course of business. Certain of these claims relate to allegations of harassment and discrimination, pay equity, denial of benefits, wage and hour violations, whistleblower protections, concerted protected activity, and other employment protections, and may be pursued on an individual or class action basis depending on applicable laws and regulations. Some of such claims may be insurable, while other such claims may not. 
 In addition, claims received from subcontractors or made by us for change orders can be the subject of lengthy negotiations, arbitration or litigation proceedings, which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. Additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant. 
 Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. Pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, criminal liability, professional warranty obligations, default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and damage our reputation. 
 Page 24 

Unavailability or cancellation of insurance coverage could increase our overall risk exposure as well as disrupt the management of our business operations. 
 We maintain insurance coverage from third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. Catastrophic events, litigation claims, and other market factors can result in decreased coverage limits, coverage that is more limited, increased premium costs or higher deductibles and/or retentions or quota shares. If any of our third-party insurers fail, suddenly cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses could increase, and the management of our business operations could be disrupted. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverage will be renewable upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at the required limits. 
 We have also elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, retentions, quota shares and limits under these programs. As a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. 
 A reduction in the amount of available governmental funding could materially affect our results of operations. 
 Historically, we have benefited from both domestic and international government investment programs that provide funding for our services, and we expect to continue to benefit from bills such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. While spending and stimulus bills are expected to provide funding in many of the markets in which we operate, we may not be able to obtain the expected benefits from these bills or similar bills in the future. In addition, the timing of funding awards under these bills is uncertain. In the United States, the upcoming change in the administration may result in a reduction in the amount of governmental funding available, which could materially affect our results of operations. 
 We are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts. 
 Third-party subcontractors we hire perform a significant amount of the work performed under our contracts. We also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project will be impaired. If we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies, parts or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, or fails to provide such services, supplies, parts or equipment in accordance with applicable quality standards as required by the contract or regulation, we will be required to source these services, equipment, parts or supplies from other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability and/or could result in claims against us for damages. We are subject to disputes with our subcontractors from time to time relating to, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed, customer concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract. In addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials would likely impact the overall project, which could result in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. 
 In an uncertain or downturn economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. The inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party s ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Page 25 

Employee, agent or partner misconduct, or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations, could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits. 
 We are subject to the risk of misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners, which could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct includes the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial and non-financial reporting, regulations pertaining to export control, environmental laws, employee wages, pay and benefits, and any other applicable laws or regulations. For example, we provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. The precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or acts of misconduct subjects us to the risk of fines and penalties, cancellation of contracts, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting, any of which could damage our reputation, weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Cybersecurity or privacy breaches, or systems and information technology interruption or failure could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to contractual penalties, significant financial losses and/or reputational harm. 
 We are subject to certain risks related to cyber-attacks, other interruptions, or errors and delays in our information technology systems. In the event we experience a cyber event that results in the theft of data or compromises operations, or we otherwise are unable to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could result in the material loss, corruption, or release of data. In addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommunications failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, malicious code, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events, cyber-attacks or disruptions. Any of these or other events could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of personal data and intellectual property and results of operations, as well as those of our clients. 
 
 As a provider of information technology services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies and a government contractor, we and our service providers, suppliers and subcontractors collect, store, transmit and otherwise process personal, confidential, proprietary and sensitive information, including classified information. As a result, our information technology systems, including those provided by third-party cloud providers or other infrastructure-as-a-service providers, ,which have grown over time, including through acquisitions, have, and will continue to experience threats and cyber-attacks, including unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware, phishing and other security breaches, problems and system disruptions, including unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients proprietary, classified or other protected information. We are also subject to social engineering attacks which have caused, and may also seek to cause in the future, payments due to or from us to be misdirected to fraudulent accounts, which may not be recoverable by us. 
 
 While we have security measures and technology in place designed to protect our and our clients proprietary, classified and other protected information, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent all threats to our computer systems. The U.S. federal government has continued to raise concerns about the potential for cyber-attacks generally as a result of heightened geopolitical tension and conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts and the escalating tensions in the Middle East, among others. In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks (e.g., AI used to develop malicious code and sophisticated phishing attempts) . Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently, cyber attacks continue to become more sophisticated and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target. As such, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. Any of these events could damage our reputation, result in significant business interruption, cause us to incur significant liability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Page 26 

We continuously evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment and information technology systems, to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons, including due to the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies and especially as we continue to operate under a hybrid working model under which employees can work and access the Company s technology infrastructure remotely. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. In addition, our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent globally, the associated risks described above may increase. Given that the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or mitigating harms after such an attack. In addition, laws, regulations, government guidance, and industry standards and practices in the United States and elsewhere are rapidly evolving to combat these threats. We may face increased compliance burdens regarding such requirements with regulators and also incur additional costs for oversight and monitoring of our own systems. 
 In addition, laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of personal data, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the United Kingdom Data Protection Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, and other emerging U.S. state and global privacy laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs and may require changes to our business practices resulting from the variation of regulatory requirements and increased enforcement frequency. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, including related regulatory enforcement and/or private litigation resulting from a potential privacy breach, could result in governmental investigations, significant fines and penalties, damages from private causes of action, or reputational harm. Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data, we may be unable to transfer personal data of employees and clients in those regions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients. 
 Our technology and intellectual property provide us, in certain instances, with a competitive advantage. Although we seek to protect our intellectual property through registration, enforcement, licensing, contractual arrangements, security controls and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could lapse, expire or be invalidated, narrowed in scope, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. Trade secrets are generally difficult to protect. We implement technical and administrative measures to protect our confidential information and trade secrets, including by requiring our employees and contractors be subject to confidentiality and invention assignment obligations, but such measures may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information or otherwise protect our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the U.S. If we are unable to enforce, protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against our intellectual property or us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. Litigation to enforce our intellectual property against third parties, to defend against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, or to determine or challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of intellectual property rights, even if we ultimately prevail, could be costly and could divert our leadership s attention away from other aspects of our business. 
 We also hold licenses to third-party technology or intellectual property, which may be utilized in our business operations. If we are no longer able to license such technology or intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. 
 We may use third-party open source software in our products. Some open source licenses, such as copyleft open source licenses, require end-users who distribute software and services that include open source software to also make available all or part of such software s source code. If our activities were determined to be non-compliant with the terms of any applicable copyleft open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release all or part of our proprietary source code for limited or no cost and our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. 
 Page 27 

If our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. Our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies. 
 We will also need to continue to respond to and anticipate changes resulting from artificial intelligence and other similarly disruptive technologies. If we are not successful in preserving and protecting our intellectual property rights and licenses, including trade secrets, or in staying ahead of developing artificial intelligence technologies, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their proprietary technology and intellectual property. There is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Government authorities may obtain certain information related to, or rights in or to the intellectual property in, our products or services. This may allow government authorities to disclose such information or license such intellectual property to third parties, including our competitors, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Assertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition and operation results. 
 In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in technology industries. We may face from time to time, allegations that we or a supplier or customer have violated the rights of third parties, including patent, trademark, and other intellectual property rights. If, with respect to any claim against us for violation of third-party intellectual property rights, we are unable to prevail in the litigation or retain or obtain sufficient rights or develop non-infringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or cost-efficient basis, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious, are time consuming, divert technical and management personnel, and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease utilizing products or services, or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. 
 If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act, commonly called the Price-Anderson Act PAA ), is a U.S. federal law, which, among other things, regulates radioactive materials and the nuclear energy industry, including liability and compensation in the event of nuclear related incidents. The PAA provides certain protections and indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and U.S. Department of Energy DoE contractors. The PAA protections and indemnification apply to us as part of our services to the U.S. nuclear energy industry and DoE for new facilities, maintenance, modification, decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear energy, weapons and research facilities. 
 We offer similar services in other jurisdictions outside the U.S. For those jurisdictions, varying levels of nuclear liability protection is provided by international treaties, and/or domestic laws, such as the Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act of Canada and the Nuclear Installations Act of the United Kingdom, insurance and/or assets of the nuclear installation operators (some of which are backed by governments) as well as under appropriate enforceable contractual indemnifications and hold-harmless provisions. These protections and indemnifications, however, may not cover all of our liability that could arise in the performance of these services. To the extent the PAA or other protections and indemnifications do not apply to our services, the cost of losses associated with liability not covered by the available protections and indemnifications, or by virtue of our loss of business because of these added costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Page 28 

Our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements. 
 In preparing our financial statements, our leadership is required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our leadership include: 
 Recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting; 
 Estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs; 
 Recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims; 
 Collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts; 
 Estimates of other liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves and reserves necessary for self-insured risks; 
 Accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; 
 Valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions and ongoing assessment of impairment; 
 Valuation estimates for redeemable noncontrolling interests calculations; 
 Valuation of stock-based compensation; 
 The determination of liabilities under pension and other post retirement benefit programs; and 
 Income tax provisions and related valuation allowances. 
 Our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets or restructuring activities may require us to record a significant charge to earnings. 
 Our long-lived assets, including our lease right-of-use assets, equity investments and others, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at the asset group level has resulted in, and could result in additional, impairment of our long-lived assets. Further changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of operations of our business. These changes, including the closure of one or more offices, could result in restructuring and/or asset impairment charges. 
 Our benefit plan expenses and obligations may fluctuate depending on various factors, including inflation, changes in levels of interest rates, changes in regulations and pension plan asset performance. 
 We have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. For example, as of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, our defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by 82.2 million and 61.5 million, respectively, not including U.S. multiemployer pension plans. See Note 13- Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional disclosure. We may have to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post retirement benefit plans we manage or for which we have contribution or funding obligations (e.g., multiemployer pension plans). If we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Additionally, we provide health care and other benefits to our employees. In recent years, costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care costs continues, our cost to provide such benefits could increase, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are also a participating employer in various Multi-Employer Pension Plans ("MEPPs") associated with some of the work we perform on a union basis, which MEPPs are managed by third party trusts and over which we have no control, including as to how the MEPPs are managed or financial investment decisions are made. If any of these MEPPs is underfunded, we could face the imposition of underfunded liability or withdrawal liability at a materially adverse level. 
 Page 29 

We also continue to monitor changes in global pension regulations, as the complexity of pension laws in the jurisdictions where we sponsor plans (for example in the UK and as highlighted by the recent Virgin Media case) can present financial risks in the event of non-compliance. 
 Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control. 
 Extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or human caused disasters and geopolitical conflicts, could negatively impact our ability to operate. As an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions that may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to work locations in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. 
 When making contract proposals, we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing to complete the associated projects, as well as assumptions regarding technical issues. However, we may remain obligated to perform our services after any natural or human caused event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. Our profitability may be adversely affected when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers. If we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects is in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or human caused catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations. In addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits. 
 Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel. 
 The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel and corporate leadership professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost. The market for these and other personnel is competitive. From time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise, and in the timeframe, demanded by our clients, or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. Furthermore, some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects. If we were to lose some or all of these personnel, they would be difficult to replace. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and leadership personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects. 
 In addition, in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the Company, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans, which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Remote working arrangements may increase our costs and adversely impact our culture and ability to effectively train our personnel. 
 As many of our employees work remotely, we must continue to adopt techniques and tools to effectively train and integrate new hires and preserve our culture. Failure to effectively train our employees could create challenges for us in maintaining high levels of employee awareness of, and compliance with, our internal procedures and external regulatory compliance requirements, in addition to increasing our recruiting, training and supervisory costs, while failure to preserve our culture for any reason could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy. 
 Page 30 

Negotiations with labor unions and possible work actions could disrupt operations and increase labor costs and operating expenses. 
 A certain portion of our work force has entered into, and additional portions may in the future enter into, collective bargaining agreements, which on occasion may require renegotiation. The outcome of future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements may not be favorable to the Company in that they may increase our operating expenses and lower our net income as a result of higher wages or benefit expenses. In addition, negotiations with unions diverts management attention and could disrupt operations, which may adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, we may have to address the threat of union-initiated work actions, including work slowdowns and strikes. Depending on the nature of the threat or the type and duration of any work action, these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our professional reputation and relationships with government agencies are critical to our business, and any harm to our reputation or relationships with government agencies could decrease the amount of business that governments do with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A significant portion of our revenue is earned directly or indirectly from various government agencies. If our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed, our future revenue and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected. Our reputation and relationship with these government agencies is a key factor in maintaining and growing revenue under our government contracts. Negative press reports regarding poor contract performance, employee misconduct, information security breaches, engagements in or perceived connections to politically or socially sensitive activities, or other aspects of our business, or regarding government contractors generally, could harm our reputation. In addition, to the extent our performance under a contract does not meet a government agency s expectations, the client might seek to terminate the contract prior to its scheduled expiration date, provide a negative assessment of our performance to government-maintained contractor past-performance data repositories, fail to award us additional business under existing contracts or otherwise, and direct future business to our competitors. If our reputation or relationships with these agencies are negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, such actions would decrease the amount of business that the government agency does with us, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our focus on new growth areas for our business entails risks, including those associated with new relationships, clients, talent needs, capabilities, service and product offerings, and maintaining our collaborative culture and core values. 
 We are focused on growing our presence in our addressable markets by: expanding our relationships with existing clients, developing new clients by leveraging our core competencies, further developing our existing capabilities and service offerings, creating new capabilities and solutions offerings to address our clients' emerging needs, and undertaking business development efforts focused on identifying near-term developments and long-term trends that may pose significant challenges for our clients. These efforts entail inherent risks associated with innovation and competition from other participants in those areas, potential failure to help our clients respond to the challenges they face, our ability to comply with uncertain evolving legal standards applicable to certain of our offerings, including those in the cybersecurity area, and, with respect to potential international growth, risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions, such as compliance with applicable foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that may impose different and, occasionally, conflicting or contradictory requirements, and the economic, legal, and political conditions in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. As we work to develop new relationships, clients, capabilities, and service and product offerings, these efforts could harm our results of operations due to, among other things, a diversion of our focus and resources and actual costs, opportunity costs of pursuing these opportunities in lieu of others and a failure to reach a profitable return on our investments in new technologies, capabilities, and businesses, including expenses on research and development investments, and these efforts could ultimately be unsuccessful. 
 The needs of our customers change and evolve regularly. Our success depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends; develop technologically advanced, innovative, and cost-effective products and services; and market these products and services to our customers. For example, one of our business strategies is to invest in, develop and promote innovative climate response technologies and solutions in order to meet the demands of our public and private sector clients. A misalignment between the technologies and solutions we identify to invest in, develop and promote and our clients needs may adversely impact our results of operations and reputation. Although we have strategies to mitigate this risk, we cannot assure you that we will identify the most effective technologies and solutions to invest in, promote or develop. Additionally, as we diversify and expand our product offerings, there is also an increased risk 
 Page 31 

that one or more of our product offerings could fail to meet specifications in a particular application or could be perceived by our customers to contain defects, which could result in our being liable for damages and losses that arise from such products. Products with defects, or which are otherwise incompatible with intended end uses, may also result in us having to recall such products, or provide additional services under the product warranty, which may impact our profitability. A failure of our products and solutions to meet specifications may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 Our success also depends on our continued access to suppliers of important technologies and components. The possibility exists that our competitors might develop new capabilities or service offerings that might cause our existing capabilities and service offerings to become obsolete. If we fail in our new capabilities development efforts or our capabilities or services fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors, our ability to procure new contracts could be negatively impacted, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, with the growth of our U.S. and international operations, we provide client services and undertake business development efforts in numerous and disparate geographic locations, both domestically and internationally. Our ability to effectively serve our clients is dependent upon our ability to successfully leverage our operating model across all of these and any future locations, maintain effective management controls over all of our locations to ensure, among other things, compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and instill our core values in all of our personnel at each of these and any future locations. Any inability to ensure any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards. 
 Commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. For example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, batteries or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. Furthermore, declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices, such as the Middle East. To the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. Rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. Cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If we, or any of our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments, lose, or experience a significant reduction in, business from one or a few large customers, it could have a material adverse impact on us. 
 A few clients have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog, or the revenue and/or backlog for our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments , in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately 10 , 9 and 8 , respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay or cancel their contracts at any time. If we, or any of our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments, lose, or experience a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We may use artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and similar technologies in our business, and challenges with properly managing such technologies could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and similar technologies (collectively, AI ), including third-party AI tools, may be enabled by, or integrated into some of our business and solutions. As with many developing technologies, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed or biased. Datasets used to train or develop AI systems may be insufficient, of 
 Page 32 

inferior quality, or contain biased information. Additionally, the laws and regulations concerning the use of AI continue to evolve. If the use or integration of AI systems, or the outputs generated by such systems, were determined to be non-compliant (e.g., in relation to intellectual property or data privacy rights), this may result in liability, including legal liability, or adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial condition and results of operations. It is possible that emerging regulations may limit or block the use of AI in our business and solutions or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect or impair the usability or efficiency of our business or services for an extended period of time or indefinitely. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their product development, product offerings, technology and infrastructure products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We maintain our cash at financial institutions, often in balances that exceed federally insured limits. 
 The majority of our cash is held in accounts at U.S. banking institutions that we believe are of high quality. Cash held in depository accounts may at times exceed the 250,000 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. If such banking institutions were to fail, we could lose all or a portion of those amounts held in excess of such insurance limitations. Any material loss that we may experience in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and could materially impact our ability to pay our operational expenses or make other payments. Banking institution failures, or changes in legislation and regulation, may adversely impact other entities that would, in turn, impact us. If our clients, suppliers, insurers, joint venture partners, sureties, or other parties with whom we do business with are affected by issues in the banking industry it may have an adverse impact on our operational and financial performance. 
 Risks Related to International Operations 
 Our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies. 
 For fiscal 2024, approximately 31 of our revenue was earned from clients outside the U.S. Our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: 
 Recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as Europe, Asia or other specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries; 
 Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and operations, including challenges related to logistics, communications and professional licensure of our international workforce; 
 Unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements; 
 Potential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, export control and anti-boycott laws and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations; 
 Potential non-compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards regarding consumer protection and data use and security, including the General Data Protection Regulation approved by the European Union and the Data Protection Act approved by the United Kingdom; 
 Lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; 
 Expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country; 
 Renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts; 
 The adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions; 
 Embargoes, duties, tariffs or other trade restrictions, including sanctions; 
 Geopolitical developments that impact our or our clients ability to operate in a foreign country; 
 Changes in labor conditions; 
 Acts of war, aggression between nations, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism; 
 The ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations; 
 Social, political, and economic instability; 
 Changes to tax policy; 
 Currency exchange rate fluctuations; 
 Limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and 
 Page 33 

U.S. government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate. 
 The lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. In addition, military action, geopolitical shifts or continued unrest, particularly in the Middle East, could disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and may also impact the supply or pricing of oil, increase our security costs and cost of compliance with local laws, and present risks to our reputation. Additionally, recent events, including changes in U.S. trade policies and responsive changes in policy by foreign jurisdictions and similar geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts, escalating tensions in the Middle East, increasing tensions between the U.S. and China and uncertainty in the E.U., Asia and elsewhere, have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally, and may increase the volatility of global financial markets and the global and regional economies. 
 In addition, our globally connected talent force collaborates to deliver solutions for clients, agnostic of geography. This relies upon client procurement models that are open to global professional service provision. Increased nationalization and heightened buy-local policies and regulation could reduce the effectiveness and competitive differentiation enabled by our global delivery model and compound the existing talent shortage in key geographies. To the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Changes in domestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations and policies, changes in statutory tax rates and laws, and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits could adversely affect our business, profitability and reputation. 
 Our domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws, regulations and policies (including environmental and employment requirements, export/import laws, tax policies, integrated financial/non-financial reporting requirements such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive in the European Union and other similar legal requirements). Failure to comply with any of the foregoing laws, regulations and policies could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, as well as damage to our reputation. In addition, our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, data security, data privacy and health and safety laws, may exceed our estimates. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation. 
 We are subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions. Accordingly, our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. A material change in the statutory tax rate or interpretation of local law in a jurisdiction in which we have significant operations could adversely impact our effective tax rate and impact our financial results. 
 Our tax returns are subject to audit and taxing authorities could challenge our operating structure, taxable presence, application of treaty benefits or transfer pricing policies. If changes in statutory tax rates or laws or audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in tax laws could have an adverse effect on our customers, resulting in lower demand for our products and services. 
 Foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects. 
 We are a global professional services company, with our international operations accounting for approximately 31 of our annual revenue in fiscal 2024. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have reduced, and could continue to reduce, the U.S. dollar value of sales, earnings and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results, reported financial condition and the U.S. dollar value of our backlog. Our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. 
 Page 34 

In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates may increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in international markets. While we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. We may attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. These actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. The governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency. We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries. 
 Our global presence could give rise to material fluctuations in our income tax rates. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, or an ultimate determination that the Company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated costs. 
 Some of our services are performed in high-risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war, terrorism or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. Despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot always guarantee the safety of our personnel. Acts of terrorism, threats of armed conflicts and human rights violations in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel or the cancellation of contracts, and in some instances, cause damage to our reputation. The loss of key employees or contractors, whether as a result of injury, death or attrition, may adversely impact our business operations. 
 Risks Related to the Separation Transaction 
 We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation Transaction, including with respect to our remaining ownership interest. 
 On September 27, 2024, we completed the separation of our Critical Mission Services business and a portion of our Divergent Solutions business (the Separated Business in the Separation Transaction. We have expended significant management time and resources in connection with the Separation Transaction and may incur significant additional expenses and challenges in connection with the Separation Transaction. Although we believe that the Separation Transaction will enhance our long-term value by allowing us to dedicate financial and human capital resources to pursue appropriate growth opportunities and execute our strategic plan, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation of our businesses, and the Separation Transaction may adversely affect our business. The Separation Transaction resulted in two independent, publicly traded companies, each of which is now a smaller, less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the Separation Transaction, which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions. Additionally, a potential loss of synergies from the Separation Transaction could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 Additionally, any contractual arrangements between us and the Separated Business may be on less favorable terms than the prior intercompany arrangements from which we previously benefited, may not efficiently mitigate dis-synergies arising from the Separation Transaction, and may be inadequate to provide for the ongoing operation and growth of our business, preserve continuity for clients, deliver key capabilities or otherwise provide for continued cooperation in relevant business areas. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result 
 Page 35 

of the Separation Transaction, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 As a result of the Separation Transaction, we hold 7.5 of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Amentum. An additional amount of approximately 4.5 of the issued and outstanding common stock of Amentum (the "contingent consideration") has been placed in escrow, to be released and delivered in the future to us and our shareholders or the former sole equity holder of Amentum, depending on the achievement of certain operating profit targets by the Separated Business. To the extent Jacobs and shareholders become entitled to any portion of the contingent consideration, the first 0.5 of the outstanding shares of Amentum will be released from escrow and delivered to us. Any further contingent consideration to which we and our shareholders may become entitled will be distributed on a pro rata basis to shareholders as of a record date to be determined in the future. Any shares of contingent consideration to which we and our shareholders do not become entitled to receive will be delivered to the former equity holder of Amentum. 
 
 We cannot predict the trading price of shares of Amentum s common stock and the market value of the Amentum shares are subject to market volatility and other factors outside of our control. We intend to divest our ownership interest in Amentum within 12 months of the distribution, but there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of such divestiture. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the divestiture, including but not limited to financial market conditions. 
 Amentum may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation Transaction. 
 In connection with the Separation Transaction, we and Amentum entered into various transaction agreements, including a transition services agreement and project services agreement. These agreements provide for the performance of certain services by us or Amentum for our benefit of the other party for a period of time after the separation. We rely on Amentum to satisfy its performance obligations under these agreements. If Amentum is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including indemnification obligations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 The Separation Transaction could result in a significant tax liability if the terms of the private letter ruling are not satisfied. 
 In connection with the Separation Transaction, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS stating that the distribution qualified for tax-free treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the opinions of tax advisors received prior to the distribution, if the IRS determines that factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect or if undertakings made to the IRS in connection with the letter ruling request are or have been violated, then we will not be able to rely on the IRS ruling and the potential resulting tax liability to us and our shareholders could be substantial. 
 In general, if the distribution and certain related transactions were determined not to qualify as transactions described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code at a point in the future, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each of our shareholders who received Amentum common stock in the distribution would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution, and we generally would recognize taxable gain with respect to the transfer of Amentum common stock in the distribution, which could result in a significant tax to us. Additionally, if one or more persons acquire a 50 or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of Jacobs or Amentum, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution, then, even if the distribution otherwise qualifies as a transaction described in Section 355 of the Code, the distribution may result in a tax liability to us (but not to our shareholders). For purposes of Section 355(e) of the Code, any acquisitions of Jacobs or Amentum stock, directly or indirectly, within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are generally presumed to be part of such a plan, although we may, depending on the facts and circumstances, be able to rebut that presumption. 
 
 Risks Related to Acquisitions, Investments, Joint Ventures and Divestitures 
 Page 36 

Our use of joint ventures, partnerships and strategic investments in entities exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. 
 As is common in our industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. This situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients. 
 Further, we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners, including with respect to nonperformance, default, bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance. Our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. If these circumstances occur, we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract. These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners. Differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues, which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures. In addition, in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement. If we are not able to enforce our contractual rights, we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities. 
 We participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. In these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. To the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 An impairment charge on our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
 Because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. As of September 27, 2024, we had 4.79 billion of goodwill, representing 40.7 of our total assets of 11.8 billion. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to test goodwill carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis, and whenever events occur, or circumstances change, that indicate impairments could exist, based upon a fair value approach. We also assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indications of impairment are present based on expected future probability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations. We have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter. 
 If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. If the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. The amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. For a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see Item 7- Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below. 
 Our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions and strategic investments to sustain our growth. These transactions present certain risks and uncertainties. 
 Our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of, and strategic investments in, other companies, such as our acquisitions of CH2M, BlackLynx and StreetLight and our strategic investment in PA Consulting. These transactions, as well as transactions we may engage in in the future, present a number of risks, including: 
 Page 37 

Assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the transaction was negotiated, such as if the target company failed to comply with U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and/or contractual requirements with clients; 
 Valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the target company's business; 
 Failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth opportunities within the anticipated timeframe or at all; 
 The loss of key customers or suppliers, including as a result of any actual or perceived conflicts of interest; 
 Difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; 
 Difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business; 
 For strategic investments in which we do not acquire 100 of the target company, the other equity holders may have various governance rights and minority protections, including consent rights over certain actions taken by the company, and these may result in additional costs, including from continuing to operate the target company on a standalone basis; 
 The effects of diverting leadership s attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of target companies; 
 Potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations, strategic investments and/or divestitures; 
 Potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or investment or post-closing deterioration in the target company's business; 
 Difficulties relating to assimilating the leadership, personnel, benefits, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities; 
 Difficulties retaining key personnel of the target company; 
 Increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities; 
 Increased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial and non-financial (e.g., climate-related) reporting and internal controls; 
 The potential for claims for damages by the sellers of any business if we enter into an acquisition agreement that we do not ultimately consummate, or if disputes arise post-closing relating to post-closing covenants or payment obligations; and 
 The risks discussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors that may relate to the activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition. 
 While we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses and/or insurance that could mitigate certain of these risks, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity, or the insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses. 
 If our leadership is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy with respect to acquisitions and/or strategic investments, our operating results could be harmed. Moreover, we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability. 
 In addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition or investment targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. Existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions and/or strategic investments. Future acquisitions and/or strategic investments may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms, or at all. Acquisitions and/or strategic investments may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced. 
 Acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures create various business risks and uncertainties during the pendency of the transaction. 
 Consummation of any merger, strategic investment or divestiture is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including one or more of the following: (i) due diligence and its associated time and cost commitments, (ii) 
 Page 38 

board and shareholder approval, (iii) regulatory approvals, (iv) the absence of any legal restraint that would prevent the consummation of the transaction, (v) the absence of material adverse conditions which can prevent the consummation of the transaction, and (vi) compliance with covenants and the accuracy of representations and warranties contained in the transaction agreement, among others. One or more of these conditions may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the transaction may not be consummated or may be significantly delayed. In such case, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock may decline, particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be consummated or will be consummated within a particular timeframe. 
 Furthermore, most transactions require the Company to incur substantial expense associated with closing and if the transaction is not consummated, we will incur these expenses without realizing the expected benefits. The pursuit of the transaction will also require management attention and use of internal resources that would otherwise be focused on general business operations. In addition, customers uncertainty about the effect of the transaction may have an adverse effect on the ability to win customer contracts or could cause existing clients to seek to change existing business relationships. Employee morale due to the uncertainties associated with the transaction could also be negatively affected. Any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with a failure or delay in consummating a transaction, including the diversion of management attention or loss of other opportunities during the pendency of the transaction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may make minority investments that subject us to risks and uncertainties outside of our control. 
 From time to time, the Company may make minority investments in the equity securities of companies that we do not control. Minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the minority investment. 
 To the extent we hold only a minority equity interest in a company, we may lack affirmative control rights, which may diminish our ability to influence the company s affairs in a manner intended to enhance the value of our investment in the company. We could incur losses if the majority stakeholders or the management of the company takes risks or otherwise acts in a manner that does not serve our interests. In addition, we could be subject to reputational harm if the company in which the investment is made makes business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree. These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with management or employees of the company in which the investment is made, or its other stockholders. 
 In most cases, the companies in which we make investments will have indebtedness or equity securities or may be permitted to incur indebtedness or to issue equity securities, which rank senior to our investment. We also may make investments in early-stage companies that depend on venture funding and are not profitable. In the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made, holders of debt instruments and securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of our investment. 
 We may also enter into separate commercial arrangements with these companies, whether before, concurrently with, or after making a minority investment. In certain cases, the commercial arrangement may be a driving factor behind our investment. We cannot assure you that that the commercial arrangement will further our business strategy as we expected. We may not realize all the economic benefits expected from the commercial agreement or realize the expected return on our investments. 
 Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance 
 Past and future non-financial environmental, health, and safety-related laws and regulations could impose significant additional costs and liabilities. 
 We are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety-related laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances, and human health and safety. These laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. Violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities. 
 Page 39 

Various U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. These laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. The liability under these laws may be joint and several. We have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. The discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically, and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. Changes in the environmental laws and regulations, remediation obligations, enforcement actions, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. Failure to comply with any environmental, health, or safety laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, exposes us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If we fail to comply with any governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected. 
 We are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business, including data privacy and security, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import-export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition. For example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires compliance with all export and import laws and regulations. Although we have policies and procedures to comply with U.S. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the Company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts, and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business. 
 In addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which requires us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state and local government permits and approvals. These permits or approvals are subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals subjects us to the risk of penalties or other liabilities, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations. 
 We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA ), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances; strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Climate Change and ESG 
 Climate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Page 40 

Climate change related events, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, freezing conditions, and other natural disasters, may have both immediate and long-term impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks regardless of where we conduct our business. For example, a catastrophic natural disaster could negatively impact any of our office locations and the locations of our customers. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business is critical to our operations. Accordingly, a natural disaster has the potential to disrupt our and our customers businesses and may cause us to experience work stoppages, project delays, financial losses and additional costs to resume operations, including increased insurance costs or loss of coverage, legal liability and reputational losses. 
 Further, the risks caused by climate change span across the full spectrum of the markets we serve. Our end-to-end services span advanced manufacturing, cities places, energy, environmental, life sciences, transportation and water. The direct physical risks that climate change poses to infrastructure through chronic environmental changes, such as rising sea levels and temperatures, and acute events, such as hurricanes, droughts and wildfires, is common to each of these markets. Infrastructure owners could face increased costs to maintain their assets, which could result in reduced profitability and fewer resources for strategic investment. These types of physical risks could in turn lead to transitional risks (i.e., the degree to which society responds to the threat of climate change), such as market and technology shifts, including decreased demand for our services and solutions, reputational risks, such as how our values and practices regarding a low carbon transition are viewed by external and internal stakeholders, and policy and legal risks, such as the extent to which low carbon transitions are driven by the governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate around the globe, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change. 
 Growing public concern about climate change has resulted in the increased focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions and climate change issues. Governmental policies designed to address climate change could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, climate legislation across all geographies poses a similar risk to us and our clients as we operate globally. However, further policy changes and climate legislation could also increase the overall demand for our services as our clients and partners work to comply with such policies, such as by decarbonizing their industries, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and developing integrated and sustainable solutions, which could have a positive impact on our business. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers. 
 We may also incur additional expenses as a result of U.S. and international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding GHG emissions, and broader ESG-related factors. Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of both climate change and these broader matters. 
 We may be unable to achieve our climate commitments and targets. 
 At Jacobs, we have committed to do our part to help solve the climate crisis by setting ambitious climate commitments and targets, including our goals to remain carbon neutral for our operations and business travel and reach net-zero for our entire value chain by 2040. However, achievement of our climate commitments and targets is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to execute our operational strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes; the availability and cost of alternative fuels, global electrical charging infrastructure, off-site renewable energy and other materials and components; unforeseen design, operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates or requirements relating to GHG emissions, carbon costs or climate-related goals; labor-related regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third party contractors; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions; the actions of competitors and competitive pressures and an acquisition of or merger with another company that has not adopted similar carbon goals or whose progress toward reaching its carbon goals is not as advanced as ours. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our operational strategies and achieve our climate commitments and targets. 
 
 Page 41 

While our climate commitments and targets are ambitious, we believe that they are realistic and achievable. We have also developed a roadmap for implementation of our carbon reduction goals and our global emissions reduction trajectory suggests that we continue on a pathway to meet our targets. However, we also recognize that some of our emission reductions over the past few years may have been primarily the result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our roadmap recognizes these anomalies, and we are putting measures in place to establish a going-forward trajectory to attain our commitments. However, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be successful. Failure to achieve our climate commitments and targets could damage our reputation and our customer and other stakeholder relationships. If we are unable to meet our climate commitments and targets and appropriately address sustainability enhancement, we may lose investors, customers, or partners, our stock price may be negatively impacted, our reputation may be negatively affected, and it may be more difficult for us to compete effectively, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Increasing scrutiny and changing and conflicting expectations from governmental organizations, clients, investors, suppliers and partners, communities and our employees with respect to our ESG and diversity and inclusion-related practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. 
 There is increased scrutiny from governmental organizations, clients, and employees on companies environmental, social, and governance ESG practices and disclosures, including with respect to inclusion and diversity. If our ESG practices, including our goals for inclusion and diversity, do not meet evolving rules and regulations or stakeholder expectations and standards (or if we are viewed negatively based on positions we do or do not take or work we do or do not perform or cannot publicly disclose for certain clients and industries), then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain leading experts, employees and other professionals and our ability to attract new business and clients could be negatively impacted, as could our attractiveness as an investment, service provider, employer, or business partner. Similarly, any failure or perceived failure in our efforts to execute our ESG strategy or our diversity and inclusion strategy and achieve our current or future related goals, targets, and objectives, or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines expected by stakeholders or at all, could also result in similar negative impacts. Organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed rating processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, and unfavorable ratings of our ESG efforts may lead to negative investor sentiment, diversion of investment to other companies, and difficulty in hiring skilled employees. In addition, complying or failing to comply with existing or future federal, state, local, and foreign legislation and regulations applicable to our ESG efforts, which may conflict with one another, could cause us to incur additional compliance and operational costs or actions and suffer reputational harm, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Credit Markets 
 We rely in part on liquidity from our credit facilities to fund our business. Restrictions in our credit facilities and other indebtedness could adversely affect our business. 
 We are currently a borrower under several credit facilities and our subsidiary, Jacobs Engineering Inc., has issued notes pursuant to an indenture with respect to which Jacobs has provided a guarantee. These facilities and indenture contain customary covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to incur certain liens and indebtedness. We are also subject to certain financial covenants in our credit facilities, including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. A breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under one or more of our credit facilities or indentures and limit our ability to do further borrowing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may be prohibited from undertaking actions that are necessary or desirable to maintain or expand our business. Additionally, if it becomes necessary to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, or if we are unable to refinance at all, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates. 
 Our business may be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit. 
 We depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. Instability in the credit markets in the U.S. or abroad, and continued inflation and rising interest rates could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. This situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our 
 Page 42 

existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 
 In addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. Disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients. In addition, clients may be unable to fund new projects, may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them. These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in North America, Europe, South America, Australia and Asia. Some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. In addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. Although none of our lenders or the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that such events may occur in the future. If any such events were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access cash, which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts. 
 In line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers. These instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. If a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit, we cannot pursue that project. Historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the Company's credit-worthiness. Because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding, or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. There can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. In addition, future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase and our net income and cash flows to correspondingly decrease. 
 Borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. In the past year, inflation and other factors have resulted in an increase in interest rates generally, which has impacted our borrowing costs. Even though interest rates have moderated in recent months, if interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness referred to above would increase even if the principal amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. We are also currently party to, and in the future, we may enter into additional, interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments, in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. 
 In addition, our credit facilities reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as the primary benchmark rate for our variable rate indebtedness. SOFR is a relatively new reference rate and with a limited history, and changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates. As a result, the amount of interest we may pay on our variable rate indebtedness is difficult to predict. 
 We have also included sustainability-linked key performance indicators ("KPIs") in our credit facilities and certain of our senior notes, with KPI targets that include improving gender diversity and, in the case of the senior notes, reducing 
 Page 43 

GHG emissions. Failure to achieve such targets could result in an interest rate step up on the debt, which would cause an increase in our debt payment obligations and could negatively impact our reputation. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Corporate Structure 
 Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. 
 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or fall below the expectations of securities analysts, which could have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock. Fluctuations are caused by a number of factors, including: 
 Legal proceedings, disputes and/or government investigations; 
 Fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers; 
 The number and significance of projects executed during a quarter; 
 Unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits; 
 The timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments; 
 Delays incurred in connection with a project; 
 Changes in prices of commodities or other supplies; 
 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates; 
 Weather conditions that delay work at project sites; 
 The timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives; 
 The decision by the Board of Directors to begin or cease paying a dividend, and the expectation that if the Company pays dividends, it will declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future; 
 Natural disasters or other crises; 
 Staff levels and utilization rates; 
 Changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and 
 General economic and political conditions. 
 There can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock. 
 Our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid, and intend to continue paying, regular quarterly dividends. The declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price. 
 In the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership, and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture, the value of stock is subject to fluctuation. 
 One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. If we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders individual ownership percentages in the Company. 
 In addition, if we receive stock or other equity securities in connection with a sale or divestiture of a business, the value of such stock will fluctuate and/or be subject to trading restrictions. Stock price changes may result from, among other things, changes in the business, operations or prospects of the issuer prior to or following the transaction, litigation or regulatory considerations, general business, market, industry or economic conditions, the ability to sell all or a portion of the stock based on current market conditions, and other factors both within and beyond our control. In addition, if the stock received is valued in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the value of such stock will also fluctuate based on foreign currency rates. 
 Page 44 

Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control. 
 We are a Delaware corporation. Certain anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. In addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. For example: 
 Only our Board of Directors can fill vacancies on the board; 
 There are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and 
 Our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares. 
 These types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. Accordingly, shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares. 
 We are a holding company. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries. We depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us to fund our operations. 
 We are a holding company. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries, which are separate and distinct legal entities. Therefore, we are reliant on the operations of our subsidiaries to fund (whether by dividend, distribution or loan) holding company operations, including our ability to pay dividends and service any indebtedness of the holding company. In addition, we cannot assure you that the agreements governing the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments of dividends or other obligations of the holding company. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions or loans to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law and monetary transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Furthermore, payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings.

 Item 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 We maintain a cybersecurity program, designed to proactively identify, assess, manage, mitigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats. Our Cybersecurity Organization develops, implements, and maintains this program, which is documented in our global cybersecurity policy. The underlying controls of the cybersecurity program are based on recognized best practices and standards for cybersecurity and information technology and is aligned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Cybersecurity Framework CSF and the International Organization Standardization ISO 27001 Information Security Management System Requirements. Cybersecurity is an important and integrated part of our enterprise risk management program that identifies, monitors and mitigates business, operational and legal risks. Our cybersecurity risk management process is integrated into our overall risk management process, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the risk management process to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational and financial risk areas. 
 We regularly assess the threat landscape and take a holistic view of cybersecurity risks, with a layered cybersecurity strategy based on prevention, detection and mitigation. Our cybersecurity program maintains assessment protocols for proactively evaluating potential cybersecurity impacts and risks, supported by incident response procedures. We employ systematic processes to manage cybersecurity risks, including through cybersecurity audits, interconnectivity with business networks, system access controls and monitoring, and data back-up and recovery. Our cloud environments undergo continuous assessment, with firewall and backup systems designed to support operational resilience. We employ a Zero Trust Security framework that requires identity verification for network access, complemented by regular system assessments and monitoring. Our security controls include identity management programs, data loss prevention protocols, and threat detection capabilities. Our controls undergo regular review and updates based on threat intelligence, ensuring adaptability to merging threats. Similarly, our incident response program is regularly tested and updated to address emerging threat landscapes. To ensure organization-wide security awareness, cybersecurity training is mandatory and issued to all employees annually. Cybersecurity awareness is also included across other training programs, including our annual Code of Conduct and privacy training programs. 
 Third-party risk management is a critical component of our security strategy. We maintain oversight of service providers through a proactive monitoring approach, leveraging a cybersecurity questionnaire and security and privacy 
 Page 45 

addenda to our contracts where applicable. We evaluate third party providers for maintenance of effective security management programs, compliance with information handling and asset management protocols, and require prompt notification of known or suspected cyber incidents. 
 To validate our security posture, we engage independent external parties to conduct regular penetration testing and security audits, and to provide cybersecurity consulting services. We maintain ISO 27001 certification for our global enterprise. Additionally, our IT General Controls (ITGC) undergo annual testing through Sarbanes-Oxley audits, which examine security controls relating to system changes, access management, system configurations, and data backup processes. 
 Our Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of cybersecurity and information security risk, which it manages as part of our enterprise risk management program. Specifically, the Board is assisted by the Audit Committee and the ESG and Risk Committee, which oversees our cybersecurity risk exposures and the steps taken by management to monitor and mitigate cybersecurity risks, and reports to the Board. Throughout the year, our senior executives, including our Chief Information Security Officer ("CISO"), provide regular briefings to the full Board, the Audit Committee and the ESG and Risk Committee. These presentations cover technology trends, regulatory developments, disclosure requirements, legal issues, policies and practices, threat environment assessments, and ongoing security measures to prevent, detect, and respond to critical threats. The Board, the Audit Committee and the ESG and Risk Committee regularly discuss cybersecurity and information security risks with our senior executives. As part of our cybersecurity governance, we also utilize a Cybersecurity Steering Committee comprised of executive management, operational leaders, and cross-functional teams. Generally, this committee meets quarterly, or more frequently as appropriate, to review, assess and direct decisions related to cybersecurity and information systems matters. 
 Our cybersecurity program is led by our CISO, who reports to our Chief Information Officer (CIO). Our CISO is informed about and monitors prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through regular communication and reporting from professionals in the information security team, many of whom have decades of experience and hold certifications such as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional or Certified Information Security Manager, and through the use of technological tools and software and engagement with external consultants. Our CISO has extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk and holds the following certifications: Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), am FINRA Licensed (with a Series 99), and an Oracle Cloud Certified Professional (OCP). Our CISO and CIO regularly report directly to the Board, the Audit Committee and the ESG and Risk Committee on our cybersecurity program and efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate incidents. In addition, in the event of an incident, we intend to follow our incident response procedures that include notification processes to inform senior management and the Board of Directors and provide ongoing updates regarding any such incident until it has been remediated as appropriate. 
 Our operations are subject to cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access, system failures, and breaches that could originate from both internal networks and through third-party suppliers and service providers. While we have not experienced a material impact on our business strategy, results of operations and/or financial condition resulting from cybersecurity threats or previous cybersecurity incidents, such events have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition, including by damaging or interrupting access to our information systems or networks, compromising confidential or otherwise protected information, destroying or corrupting data, or otherwise disrupting our operations. We continuously monitor our networks for unauthorized access attempts and maintain defensive measures; however, the dynamic nature of cyber threats means we cannot guarantee prevention of all potential future incidents that could materially impact our business operations, financial condition, or strategic objectives. Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we also rely on providers of third-party products, services, and networks, with whom we may share data and services, and who may be unable to effectively defend their digital technologies and services against attack.

 Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Page 49 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 In order to better understand the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, a reader of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements. 
 The consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing long-term professional services, engineering and construction-type contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. Although our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2- Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Revenue Accounting for Contracts 
 The Company recognizes engineering, procurement, and construction contract revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Contracts that include engineering, procurement and construction services are generally accounted for as a single deliverable (a single performance obligation). In some instances, the Company s services associated with a construction activity are limited only to specific tasks such as customer support, consulting or supervisory services. In these instances, the services are typically identified as separate performance obligations. 
 The Company recognizes revenue using the percentage-of-completion method, based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs. Estimated contract costs include the Company s latest estimates using judgments with respect to labor hours and costs, materials, and subcontractor costs. The percentage-of-completion method (an input method) is the most representative depiction of the Company s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer. Subcontractor materials, labor and equipment and, in certain cases, customer-furnished materials and labor and equipment are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent (e.g., the company integrates the materials, labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer or is otherwise primarily responsible for fulfillment and acceptability of the materials, labor and/or equipment). Under the typical payment terms of our engineering, procurement and construction contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms at periodic intervals (e.g., biweekly or monthly) and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing, depending on the contract. 
 For service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time using the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method. In some instances where the Company is standing ready to provide services, the Company recognizes revenue ratably over the service period. Under the typical payment terms of our service contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing, depending on the contract. 
 Direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts, including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in providing the services required by the related projects. The level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors, including the amount of pass-through costs we incur during a period. On those projects where we are acting as principal for subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs (and we refer to such costs as pass-through costs ). 
 Accounting for Pension Plans 
 The accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans assets and liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. The actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded status of the respective plans are provided in Note 13- Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Page 50 

The expected rates of return on plan assets ranged from 5.3 to 7.6 for fiscal 2024 and range from 4.6 to 7.8 for fiscal 2025. We believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2025 reflects the long-term returns expected on the plans assets, considering recent market conditions, projected rates of inflation, the diversification of the plans assets, and the expected real rates of market returns. The discount rates used to compute plan liabilities ranged from 3.8 to 6.9 in fiscal 2024 and range from 3.4 to 7.0 in fiscal 2025. These assumptions represent the Company s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled. 
 Changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense. For example, if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation PBO at September 27, 2024 was lower or higher by 1.0 , the PBO would have been higher or lower, respectively, at that date by approximately 158.7 million for non-U.S. plans, and by approximately 21.0 million for U.S. plans. If the expected return on plan assets was lower or higher by 1.0 , the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2024 would be higher or lower, respectively, by approximately 13.1 million for non-U.S. plans, and by approximately 2.9 million for U.S. plans. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance (i.e., actuarial gains and losses) that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensi ve income (loss) and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the reasonableness of the actuarial assumptions used. 
 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
 In connection with the PA Consulting investment in March 2021, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interests, representing the interest holders' initial 35 equity interest in the form of preferred and common shares of PA Consulting. The preferred shares are entitled to a cumulative annual compounding 12 dividend based on the outstanding preferred share subscription price. These noncontrolling interest holders have certain option rights to put the preferred and common share interests back to the Company at a value based on the fair value of PA Consulting (the redemption values). The primary inputs and assumptions impacting the fair value of PA Consulting include projections of revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and discount rates applied thereto. Additionally, the Company has an option to call the interests for certain individual shareholders in certain circumstances. Because the interests are redeemable at the option of the holders and not solely within the control of the Company, the Company has classified the interests in redeemable noncontrolling interests in the mezzanine section of its Consolidated Balance Sheet at their redemption values. The optional redemption features may become exercisable no earlier than five years from the March 2, 2021 closing date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events. 
 The Company has deemed these interests probable of becoming redeemable in the future and requiring their measurement at the greater of (i) the redemption amount that would be paid if settlement occurred at the balance sheet date, or (ii) the historical value resulting from the original acquisition date fair value plus the impact of any earnings or loss attribution amounts, including dividends. The fair value of the PA Consulting redeemable noncontrolling interest is determined using a combination of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, fair value is determined by using the projected discounted cash flows of PA Consulting. Under the market approach, the fair value is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to PA Consulting, with the fair value estimated based on those companies' valuation multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. 
 Litigation, Investigations, and Insurance 
 In the normal course of business, we make contractual commitments, and on occasion we are a party in litigation or arbitration proceedings. The litigation in which we are involved primarily includes personal injury claims, professional liability claims, and breach of contract claims. We are also routinely subject to investigations and audits. 
 We maintain insurance coverage for most insurable aspects of our business and operations. Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits depending upon the type of insurance and include certain conditions and exclusions which insurance companies may raise in response to any claim that the Company brings. We have also elected to retain a portion of certain losses, claims and liabilities that occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs and utilize a number of internal financing mechanisms for these self-insurance arrangements including the operation of certain captive insurance entities. As a result, we may be subject to a future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured. We intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of the contracts which the Company enters with its clients. Our insurers are also subject to business risk and, as a result, one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise. 
 Page 51 

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include amounts representing our probable estimated liability relating to such claims, litigation, audits, and investigations. Our estimates of probable liabilities require us to make assumptions related to potential losses regarding our determination of amounts considered probable and estimable. 
 The Company believes, after consultation with counsel, that such litigation, U.S. government contract-related audits, investigations and claims, and income tax audits and investigations should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, beyond amounts currently accrued. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. We recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date. 
 The goodwill carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is tested annually for possible impairment, and on an interim basis if indicators of possible impairment exist. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure. In performing the annual impairment test, we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the beginning of the fourth quarter of its fiscal year. 
 We evaluate impairment of goodwill either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or by performing a quantitative assessment. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and circumstances affecting the reporting unit. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and after considering the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will perform a quantitative fair value test. 
 U.S. GAAP does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units. Any valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. 
 We use income and market approaches to test our goodwill for possible impairment which requires us to make estimates and judgments. Under the income approach, fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units. The Company s discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital WACC for a peer group of companies representative of the Company s respective reporting units. Under the market approach, the fair values of our reporting units are determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units; the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies. In assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired, we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated. 
 It is possible that changes in facts and circumstances, judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value, including with respect to market conditions and the economy, could change, resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future. The fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties. 
 For the 2024 fiscal year, we performed a quantitative impairment test of the DVS reporting unit at the beginning of the fourth quarter and determined that the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value. For the remaining reporting units, we determined that the fair values significantly exceeded their carrying values and an analysis beyond the qualitative level was not considered necessary. 
 Intangible assets with finite lives that arise from business acquisitions are amortized based on the period over which the contractual or economic benefit of the intangible assets are expected to be realized or on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the underlying assets. These primarily consist of customer relationships, contracts and backlog, developed technology and trade names. We assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to overall operations. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss.

2024 Overview 
 Net earnings attributable to the Company from continuing operations for fiscal 2024 were 612.8 million (or 4.79 per diluted share), an increase of 233.7 million, or 61.6 , from 379.1 million (or 3.05 per diluted share) for the prior year. The current year results reflected higher year-over-year operating profit of 16.0 million, which benefited from favorable year-over-year underlying operating results, primarily in the Infrastructure Advanced Facilities ("I AF") segment, as discussed below in the Segment Financial Information section. Further, current year results were favorably impacted by 186.9 million in pre-tax mark-to-market gains associated with our invest ment in Amentum stock recorded in connection with the Separation Transaction (see Note 14- Discontinued Operations ). The favorable underlying operating performance was achieved despite higher year over year pre-tax Restructuring and other charges and transaction costs due primarily to expenses incurred relating to the Separation Transaction amounting to 144.2 million (primarily professional services and employee separation costs), compared to fiscal 2023 amounts of 142.5 million mainly associated with the Company's Restructuring and other charges and transaction costs relating to expenses incurred in conjunction with the real estate transformation rescaling initiatives and the PA Consulting restructuring program charges (primarily employee separation costs) and expenses incurred relating to the Separation Transaction (primarily professional services). See Note 17- Restructuring and Other Charges. 
 Net interest expense was favorable by 8.5 million in the current year compared to the prior year due primarily to the Company's higher levels of cash and lower overall levels of outstanding debt compared to fiscal 2023. 
 Miscellaneous net income was favorable by 231.9 million for the current year compared to the corresponding fiscal 2023 amount, due mainly to 186.9 million in pre-tax mark-to-market gains associated with the Company's invest ment in Amentum stock, as well as a 35.2 million realized gain on interest rate swaps settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which is further discussed in Note 18- Commitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instruments. 
 Income taxes were higher in the current year by 30.2 million due primarily to 55.8 million tax expense from higher year-over-year pre-tax book income. The overall higher income tax expense was offset by a 61.6 million discrete income tax benefit related to the election to treat an Australian subsidiary as a corporation versus a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, which resulted in the derecognition of a deferred tax liability in fiscal year 2024. Also, a net tax benefit of 39.4 million was recorded in fiscal year 2023 relating to the effective settlement of uncertain tax positions. 
 Finally, year-over-year net earnings impacts associated with redeemable noncontrolling interests were lower by (6.6) million and were attributable mainly to lower after-tax earnings results in our PA Consulting investment compared to the prior year. 
 Net earnings attributable to Jacobs from discontinued operations for fiscal 2024 were 193.3 million (or 1.54 per diluted share), a decrease of 93.4 million, or 32.6 , from 286.7 million (or 2.25 per diluted share) compared to the prior year due mainly to higher charges associated with the Separation Transaction in the current year. 
 Backlog at September 27, 2024 was 21.8 billion, up 4.0 billion, from 17.8 billion for the prior year primarily driven by new business awards in our Americas business. New prospects and new sales remain strong, and the Company continues to have a positive outlook for many of the industry groups and sectors in which our clients operate. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Fiscal 2024 Compared to Fiscal 2023 
 Revenues for the year ended September 27, 2024 were 11.50 billion, an increase of 0.65 billion, or 6.0 , from 10.85 billion for the prior year. The increase in revenues was due mainly to improved performance of our I AF business, as well as higher revenues year over year in our PA Consulting business. The I AF business benefited primarily from stronger performance in its Advanced Facilities and international business operations. Our revenues for fiscal 2024 were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation of 77.0 million in our international businesses, as compared to an unfavorable impact of 175.3 million for the last fiscal year. 
 Page 54 

Gross profit for the year ended September 27, 2024 was 2.83 billion, up 121.9 million, or 4.5 , from 2.71 billion for the prior year. The Company's increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to higher revenues as mentioned above, with slight margin impacts from year over year mix and personnel cost impacts. Our gross profit margins showed consistent trends year over year at 24.6 and 25.0 for the years ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. Overall project mix impacts in our portfolios, personnel costs and utilization trends primarily in the PA Consulting business had mostly offsetting impacts on our overall margin trends year over year. 
 See Segment Financial Information discussion for further information on the Company s results of operations at the operating segment level. 
 Selling, general administrative expenses for the year ended September 27, 2024 were 2.14 billion, an increase of 105.9 million, or 5.2 , from 2.03 billion for the prior year. The current year's results were impacted by Restructuring and other charges of 163.4 million in separation activities (mainly professional services and employee separation costs) relating to the Separation Transaction in comparison to prior period costs of 61.1 million. Further our SG A expenses were impacted by slight increases in other department spend and personnel costs. Lastly, SG A expenses were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of 2.1 million for the year ended September 27, 2024 as compared to favorable impacts of 58.9 million for fiscal 2023. 
 Net interest expense for the year ended September 27, 2024 was 134.6 million, a decrease of 8.5 million from 143.1 million for the prior year. The decrease in net interest expense for the fiscal year 2024 was due primarily to the Company's higher levels of cash and lower overall levels of outstanding debt compared to the last fiscal year. 
 Miscellaneous income, net for the year ended September 27, 2024 was income of 219.5 million, favorable by 231.9 million as compared to (12.4) million for the prior year. The increase in income from fiscal 2023 was due primarily to 186.9 million in mark-to-market gains associated with our investment in Amentum stock in connection with the Separation Transaction and a 35.2 million realized gain on interest rate swaps settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Net earnings attributable to Jacobs from discontinued operations for fiscal 2024 were 193.3 million (or 1.54 per diluted share), a decrease of 93.4 million, or 32.6 , from 286.7 million (or 2.25 per diluted share) for the last year. Included in the current year results from discontinued operations is 98.3 million in costs related to the Separation Transaction and approximately 18 million in pre-tax non-cash charges associated with one-time inventory write downs. 
 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests including redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended September 27, 2024 of 33.0 million and 40.5 million for the corresponding period last year. The year over year changes were primarily due to lower net earnings results in our PA Consulting investment compared to the prior year periods. 
 
 Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022 
 Revenues for the year ended September 29, 2023 were 10.85 billion, an increase of 1,068.3 million, or 10.9 , from 9.78 billion from fiscal 2022. The increase in revenues was due mainly to improved performance of our I AF business, as well as higher revenues year over year in our PA Consulting business. The I AF business benefited primarily from stronger performance in its Advanced Facilities and international business operations. Additionally, the increase in revenues for fiscal 2023 were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 175.3 million in our international businesses, as compared to an unfavorable impact of 277.3 million for the corresponding period last fiscal year. 
 Gross profit for the year ended September 29, 2023 was 2.71 billion, up 130.9 million, or 5.1 , from 2.58 billion for fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 gross profit was favorable due to higher revenue as mentioned above and impacts from cost reductions associated mainly with first quarter 2023 changes in employee benefit programs, which were partly offset by higher spend in company technology platforms and other personnel and corporate cost increases. Our gross profit margins were approximately 25.0 for the years ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Project mix impacts in our portfolios, higher personnel costs and lower utilization trends primarily in the PA Consulting business impacted our fiscal 2023 margins, partly offset by new program startups won in fiscal 2023.

Selling, general administrative expenses for the year ended September 29, 2023 were 2.03 billion, a decrease of 5.7 million, or 0.3 , from 2.04 billion for fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 results were impacted by Restructuring and other charges of 61.1 million in separation activities (mainly professional services and employee separation costs) relating to the Separation Transaction and by higher incentives of 46.2 million. Fiscal 2022 was impacted by the final pre-tax 91.3 million settlement of the Legacy CH2M Matter, net of previously recorded reserves, mentioned above and approximately 27 million in third party recoveries was recorded as receivables reducing SG A. Fiscal 2023 results were also impacted by decreases in real estate related costs, as well as other department spend decreases due in part to the Company's transformation initiatives. Lastly, SG A expenses benefited from favorable foreign exchange impacts of 58.9 million for the year ended September 29, 2023 as compared to favorable impacts of 90.7 million for fiscal 2022. 
 Net interest expense for the year ended September 29, 2023 was 143.1 million, an increase of 47.2 million from 95.9 million for fiscal 2022.The increase in net interest expense year over year is primarily due to higher interest rates in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year period. The increase was offset in part by 6.3 million net interest benefit during fiscal 2023 related to the release of interest accruals associated with the effective settlement of uncertain tax positions. 
 Miscellaneous income (expense), net for the year ended September 29, 2023 was expense of 12.4 million, a decrease of 45.9 million as compared to 33.5 million in income for fiscal 2022. The increase in expense from fiscal 2022 was due primarily to an increase in pension costs associated with higher interest rate impacts in fiscal 2023 along with comparatively unfavorable foreign exchange gains and losses in fiscal 2023. Additionally, fiscal 2022 benefited primarily from a 5.1 million gain related to a lease termination. 
 Net earnings attributable to Jacobs from discontinued operations for fiscal 2023 were 286.7 million (or 2.25 per diluted share), a decrease of 3.2 million, or 1.1 , from 289.9 million (or 2.24 per diluted share) for the corresponding prior year period. 
 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests including redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended September 29, 2023 of 40.5 million and 57.0 million for the corresponding period last year. The year over year changes were primarily due to lower net earnings results in our PA Consulting investment compared to the prior year periods. 
 On February 4, 2022, the Company acquired StreetLight Data, Inc. ("StreetLight") and on November 19, 2021, a subsidiary of Jacobs acquired BlackLynx ("BlackLynx"). For further discussion, see Note 16- Other Business Combinations.

 Restructuring and Other Charges 
 During fiscal 2023, the Company implemented restructuring initiatives relating to the Separation Transaction. The Company incurred approximately 42.0 million and 17.5 million in the years ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively, in pre-tax cash charges in connection with these initiatives. These actions, which are expected to be substantially completed before the end of fiscal 2025, are expected to result in estimated gross annualized pre-tax cash savings of approximately 120 million to 147 million. We will likely incur additional charges under this program through fiscal 2025, which are expected to result in additional savings in future periods. 
 
 During third quarter fiscal 2023, the Company approved a plan to improve business processes and cost structures of our PA Consulting investment by reorganizing senior management and reducing headcount. In connection with these initiatives, which are expected to be substantially completed in early fiscal 2025, the Company incurred approximately 6.4 million and 14.3 million in the years ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively, in pre-tax cash charges. These activities are expected to result in estimated gross annualized pre-tax cash savings of approximately 50 million to 65 million. 
 
 During fiscal 2023, the Company implemented restructuring and cost reduction initiatives relating to the formation of the reporting and operating segment, Divergent Solutions, which were substantially completed in fiscal 2023. 
 Page 57 

The Company incurred approximately 6.0 million in pre-tax cash charges in connection with these initiatives during the year ended September 29, 2023. These actions are expected to result in estimated gross annualized pre-tax cash savings of approximately 15.6 million to 19.1 million. 
 
 During fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2023, the Company implemented further real estate rescaling efforts that were associated with its fiscal 2020 transformation program relating to real estate. These activities were substantially completed in fiscal 2023. In connection with these efforts, the Company has incurred 45.7 million and 69.7 million in the years ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, in pre-tax mainly non-cash charges. These actions resulted in non-cash savings related mainly to the future amortization of lease right-of-use assets over the remaining lease terms. Additionally, the objective of these initiatives was to create a modern, flexible work platform tailored to employees needs due to globalization and digital advances and to create total emissions savings that will be realized as we continue to optimize our real estate footprint.

Additionally, fiscal 2023 included approximately 15.0 million in net favorable impacts from cost reductions compared to the prior year period, which was associated mainly with net favorable impacts during first quarter from changes in employee benefit programs of 41.0 million offset by approximately 26.0 million in higher spend in company technology platforms and other personnel and corporate cost increases. (2) The years ended September 27, 2024, and September 29, 2023 include 163.4 million and 61.1 million respectively, in restructuring and other charges (mainly professional services and employee separation costs) primarily related to the Separation Transaction and 6.4 million and 14.3 million respectively, in restructuring and other charges relating to the Company's investment in PA Consulting (primarily employee separation costs).

The year ended September 30, 2022 included a gain of 8.7 million related to lease terminations. The increase in net interest expense from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 is due primarily to higher interest rates. 
 In evaluating the Company s performance by operating segment, the chief operating decision maker (" CODM") reviews various metrics and statistical data for Infrastructure Advanced Facilities and PA Consulting but focuses primarily on revenues and operating profit. In addition, the Company attributes each segment's specific incentive compensation plan costs to the segments. The methods for recognizing revenue, incentive fees, project losses and change orders are consistent among the segments.

Fiscal 2024 vs. 2023 
 Revenues for the Infrastructure Advanced Facilities ("I AF") segment for the year ended September 27, 2024 were 10.32 billion, up 0.63 billion, or 6.5 , from 9.69 billion for the prior year. The increase in revenue was broad based across most I AF businesses, particularly due to stronger performance in its Advanced Facilities and Europe business operations as compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 37.5 million on our international business for the year ended September 27, 2024, compared to 124.2 million in unfavorable impacts in the prior year. 
 Operating profit for the segment for the year ended September 27, 2024 was 632.3 million, an increase of 46.9 million, or 8.0 , from 585.4 million for the comparative period in fiscal 2023. The year-over-year increase in operating profit was driven primarily by the revenue growth mentioned above with an unfavorable comparison impact of a one-time net favorable 41 million relating mainly to changes in employee benefits programs during first quarter 2023, partly offset by year over year favorable department spending. Impacts on operating profit from favorable foreign currency translation were approximately 11.5 million for the year ended September 27, 2024, compared to 4.3 million in unfavorable impacts in the prior year. 
 
 Fiscal 2023 vs. 2022 
 Revenues for the Infrastructure Advanced Facilities segment for the year ended September 29, 2023 were 9.69 billion, up 1,029.5 million, or 11.9 , from 8.66 billion for fiscal 2022. The increase in revenues from fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher fee-based revenue from our Advanced Facilities and international businesses. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 124.2 million on our international business for the year ended September 29, 2023, compared to 195.2 million in unfavorable impacts in fiscal 2022. 
 Operating profit for the segment for the year ended September 29, 2023 was 585.4 million, an increase of 85.3 million, or 17.0 , from 500.1 million for fiscal 2022. The year-over-year increase was driven by the revenue growth mentioned above with approximately 15.0 million in net favorable impacts from cost reductions associated mainly with changes in employee benefit programs in fiscal 2023 offset in part by continued higher investments in company technology platforms and personnel related costs. In addition, fiscal 2022 operating profit was impacted by 19.5 million in net charges related to a legal settlement. Impacts on operating profit from unfavorable foreign currency translation were approximately 4.3 million for the year ended September 29, 2023, compared to 5.7 million in favorable impacts in fiscal 2022.

 Revenues for the PA Consulting segment for the year ended September 27, 2024 were 1.18 billion, up 19.5 million, or 1.7 , from 1.16 billion for the prior year. The increase in revenue was due primarily to growth in PA Consulting's public services businesses.

 Revenues for the PA Consulting segment for the year ended September 29, 2023 were 1.16 billion, up 38.8 million, or 3.5 , from 1.1 billion for fiscal 2022. The increase in revenue was due primarily to growth in PA Consulting's defence security, public services, and energy utilities businesses.

Backlog Information 
 Backlog represents revenue we expect to realize for work to be completed by our consolidated subsidiaries and our proportionate share of work to be performed by unconsolidated joint ventures. Because of variations in the nature, size, expected duration, funding commitments, and the scope of services required by our contracts, the amount and timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues includes significant estimates and can vary greatly between individual contracts. 
 Consistent with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client, including our U.S. government work. While management uses all information available to determine backlog, at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. Backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues. 
 Because certain contracts (e.g., contracts relating to large Engineering, Procurement Construction ("EPC") projects as well as national government programs) can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award, and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over several fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years), we have presented our backlog on a year-over-year basis, rather than on a sequential, quarter-over-quarter basis. 
 Please refer to Item 1A- Risk Factors , above, for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts. 
 The following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 (in millions): September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Infrastructure Advanced Facilities 21,472 17,526 17,187 PA Consulting 378 311 269 Total 21,850 17,837 17,456 
 The increase in backlog in Infrastructure Advanced Facilities in the year ended September 27, 2024 was primarily driven by new business awards in our Americas business. 
 The PA Consulting backlog benefited mainly from favorable foreign exchange impacts compared to the prior year. 
 
 Backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the U.S. federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 2.4 billion (or 11.1 of total backlog), 2.6 billion (or 14.7 of total backlog) and 2.3 billion (or 13.2 of total backlog) at September 27, 2024, September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Most of our federal government contracts require that services be provided beyond one year. In general, these contracts must be funded annually (i.e., the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the U.S. Congress to the procuring agency, and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts). 
 We estimate that approximately 5.71 billion, or 26.2 , of total backlog at September 27, 2024 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year. 
 Consolidated backlog differs from the Company s remaining performance obligations as defined by ASC 606 primarily because of contract change orders or new wins not yet processed and our national government contracts where our policy is to generally include in backlog the contract award, whether funded or unfunded excluding certain option periods while our remaining performance obligations represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Additionally, the Company does not include our proportionate share of backlog related to unconsolidated joint ventures in our remaining performance obligations. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At September 27, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 1.14 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 2.11 billion of available borrowing capacity under our 2.25 billion revolving credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). We finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations. 
 Page 61 

Cash and cash equivalents at September 27, 2024 represented an increase of 373.9 million from 770.9 million at September 29, 2023, the reasons for which are described below. The following table presents selected cash flow information for the respective periods shown: 
 (In thousands) September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,054,673 974,763 Cash Flows from Investing Activities: 
 Additions to property and equipment (121,114) (137,486) Disposals of property and equipment and other assets 6,187 1,544 Capital contributions to equity investees, net of return of capital distributions 1,737 7,964 Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired (14,000) (17,685) Net cash used for investing activities (127,190) (145,663) Cash Flows from Financing Activities: 
 Proceeds from long-term borrowings 4,606,697 3,860,468 Repayments of long-term borrowings (3,370,355) (4,486,679) Proceeds from short-term borrowings 5,345 13,011 Repayments of short-term borrowings (866,761) (3,353) Debt issuance costs (34,331) (17,177) Proceeds from issuances of common stock 47,503 47,782 Common stock repurchases (402,668) (265,714) Taxes paid on vested restricted stock (41,720) (24,249) Cash dividends to shareholders (142,779) (128,420) Net dividends associated with noncontrolling interests (21,678) (23,156) Repurchase of redeemable noncontrolling interests (55,344) (92,939) Proceeds from issuances of redeemable noncontrolling interests 19,761 34,016 Cash impact from distribution of SpinCo Business (495,307) Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities (751,637) (1,086,410) Effect of Exchange Rate Changes 41,640 32,548 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 217,486 (224,762) Cash and Cash Equivalents, including Restricted Cash, at the Beginning of the Period 929,445 1,154,207 Cash and Cash Equivalents, including Restricted Cash, at the End of the Period 1,146,931 929,445 Less Cash and Cash Equivalents included in Assets held for spin (155,728) Cash and Cash Equivalents, including Restricted Cash of Continuing Operations at the End of the Period 1,146,931 773,717 
 Our net cash flow provided by operations of 1.05 billion during fiscal 2024 was favorable by 79.9 million in comparison to the cash flow provided by operations of 974.8 million for the corresponding prior year. The year-over-year increase in cash from operations is due mainly to higher cash generated from net earnings (as adjusted for non-cash income statement charges that reflect favorable net impacts mainly in accrued liabilities, prepaid expenses and other deferred liabilities) and favorable accounts receivable collections, offset in part by lower performance in other net working capital performance primarily due to higher year over year cash income tax payments and payments related to the Separation Transaction. 
 Our net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2024 was 127.2 million, compared to cash used for investing of 145.7 million in the prior year, with this change due primarily to decreases in additions to property and equipment in the current year. 
 Page 62 

Our net cash used for financing activities for the fiscal year ended 2024 of 751.6 million resulted mainly from 495.3 million direct decrease in reported cash on hand in our SpinCo business deconsolidation, 402.7 million of cash used for share repurchases, and 142.8 million in dividends to shareholders. These uses of cash were offset by 374.9 million in net proceeds from borrowings. Cash used for financing activities in the prior year was 1.09 billion, due primarily to net repayments of borrowings of 616.6 million, cash used for share repurchases of 265.7 million, 128.4 million in dividends paid to shareholders and 58.9 million in net PA Consulting related redeemable noncontrolling interests repurchase and issuance activity. 
 At September 27, 2024, the Company had approximately 164.8 million in cash and cash equivalents held in the U.S. and 980.0 million held outside of the U.S. (primarily in the U.K., India, Canada, the Eurozone, Australia and the Middle East region), which is used primarily for funding operations in those regions. Other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the U.S. (see Note 7- Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), there are no material impediments to repatriating these funds to the U.S. 
 The Company had 306.2 million in letters of credit outstanding at September 27, 2024. Of this amount, 0.5 million was issued under the Revolving Credit Facility and 305.7 million was issued under separate, committed and uncommitted letter-of-credit facilities. 
 In connection with the Separation Transaction, during the fourth quarter, Jacobs received a cash payment of approximately 911 million from SpinCo which was subsequently used for the repayment of debt, which was inclusive of the outstanding short term 2020 Term Loan Facility totaling 834.9 million. Jacobs is expected to realize additional value through the disposition of its retained equity stake in the combined company within 12 months. Please refer to Note 14 - Discontinued Operations for more details. 
 Additionally, the Company reclassified 870.4 million of debt from long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt in the fourth quarter, associated with the 2021 Term Loan Facility - GBP Portion, which is due on September 1, 2025. 
 On February 6, 2023, the Company refinanced its Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities, and on February 16, 2023, the Company issued 500.0 million in bonds. On August 18, the Company issued 600.0 million in bonds. See Note 9 - Borrowings for further discussion relating to the terms of the 5.90 Bonds, th e 6.35 Bonds, the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities following the issuances and refinancing. 
 On April 12, 2022, the Company paid cash of AUD640 million, or approximately 475 million using mid-April 2022 exchange rates, which represented the final settlement of Legacy CH2M Matter. For more information, refer to Note 19- Contractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations and Insurance . 
 On February 4, 2022, the Company acquired StreetLight Data, Inc. ("StreetLight"). StreetLight is a pioneer of mobility analytics who uses its data and machine learning resources to shed light on mobility and enable users to solve complex transportation problems. The Company paid total base consideration of approximately 190.7 million in cash and issued 0.9 million in equity and 5.2 million in in-the-money stock options to the former owners of StreetLight. The Company also paid off StreetLight's debt of approximately 1.0 million simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition. 
 On November 19, 2021, Jacobs acquired BlackLynx, a provider of high-performance software, to complement Jacobs' portfolio of digital solutions. The Company paid total base consideration of approximately 235.4 million in cash to the former owners of BlackLynx. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company also paid off BlackLynx's debt of approximately 5.3 million simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition. 
 We believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our projected cash requirements for our operations, investing activities including acquisitions, if any, and financing activities such as debt servicing, share buybacks and dividends, for the next twelve months. This is based on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our borrowing capacity and our continuing cash from operations. 
 We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at September 27, 2024.

 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes , (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, provides qualitative and quantitative updates to the Company's effective income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures, among others, in order to enhance the transparency of income tax disclosures, including consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disaggregation by jurisdiction of income taxes paid. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is also permitted. ASU 
 Page 64 

2023-09 will be effective for the Company's annual fiscal 2026 period . The Company has identified and is implementing changes to processes and internal controls to meet the standard s updated reporting and disclosure requirements. 
 ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting, (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items to reconcile to segment profit or loss, and the title and position of the entity s CODM. The amendments in this update also expand the interim segment disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments in this update are required to be applied on a retrospective basis. ASU 2023-07 will be effective for the Company's annual fiscal 2025 period. The Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
 ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements : Amendments - Codification Amendments in Response to the Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the standard to introduce changes to US GAAP that originate in either SEC Regulation S-X or S-K, which are rules about the form and content of financial reports filed with the SEC. The provisions of the standard are contingent upon instances where the SEC removes the related disclosure provisions from Regulation S-X and S-K. The Company does not expect that the application of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
 
 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other similar purposes that would expose the Company to market risk. In the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Please see the Note 9- Borrowings in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on Page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities. 
 Our Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facilities and certain other debt obligations are subject to variable rate interest which could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates. As of September 27, 2024, we had an aggregate of 1.13 billion in outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities. Interest on amounts borrowed under these agreements is subject to adjustment based on the C ompany s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facilities). Depending on the Company s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Faci lities bear interest at a SOFR rate plus a margin of between 0.975 and 1.725 or a base rate plus a margin of between 0 and 0.625 including applicable margins while borrowings denominated in British pounds under these respective facilities bear interest at an adjusted SONIA rate plus a margin of between 0.908 and 1.6580 . Additionally, our Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facilities and 5.90 Bonds due 2033 have interest rates subject to potential increases relating to certain ESG metrics as stipulated in the related agreements and as discussed in Note 9 - Borrowings . During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, in connection with the Separation Transaction, the Company repaid the outstanding USD and GBP portion of the 2020 Term Loan Facility. 
 However, as discus sed in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instrument s, we have swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of 200.0 million in place to convert the variable rate interest-based liabilities associated with a corresponding amount of our debt into fixed interest rate liabilities, leaving 0.93 billion in principal amount subject to variable interest rate risk. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, in connection with the Separation Transaction, the Company terminated two interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of 554.7 million. Additionally, during fiscal 2022, we entered into two treasury lock arrangements with an aggregate notional value of 500.0 million, which were settled in second quarter fiscal 2023. See Note 18 - Commitments and Conting encies and Derivative Financial Instrument s. 
 For the year ended September 27, 2024, our weighted average floating rate borrowings that are subject to floating rate exposure were approximately 1.4 billion. If floating interest rates had increased by 1.00 , our interest expense for the year ended September 27, 2024 would have increased by approximately 14.1 million. 
 Page 65 

Foreign Currency Risk 
 In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. We follow the provisions of ASC No. 815, Derivatives and Hedging in accounting for our derivative contracts. The Company has 827.3 million in notional value of exchange rate sensitive instruments at September 27, 2024. See Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instruments for discussion.

 I tem 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are those controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of September 27, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date ). Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the Evaluation Date were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining for the Company adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date based on the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date was effective. 
 The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, which audited the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2024, as stated in their report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Page 66 

Changes in Internal Control 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 The Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed or operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met. The design of the Company s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints, and that the benefits of such control systems must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions. 
 
 Item 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

 From advisory and consulting, feasibility, planning, design, program and lifecycle management, Jacobs provides end-to-end services in advanced manufacturing, cities places, energy, environmental, life sciences, transportation and water. Jacobs provides its services through offices and subsidiaries located primarily in North America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Australia, New Zealand and Asia. Jacobs provides its services under cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts, with fixed-price contracts comprised mainly of professional services arrangements and in some limited cases, construction. 
 Fixed-price 
 Basis of Presentation, Definition of Fiscal Year, and Other Matters 
 The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") and include the accounts of Jacobs Solutions Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates which it controls. On August 29, 2022, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEGI), the predecessor to Jacobs Solutions Inc., implemented a holding company structure, which resulted in Jacobs Solutions Inc. becoming the parent company of, and successor issuer to, JEGI (the "Holding Company Reorganization"). Prior to the implementation date, the Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JEGI and its subsidiaries and affiliates which it controlled. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 The Company s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30 (determined on the basis of the number of workdays) and, accordingly, an additional week of activity is added every five-to-six years. Fiscal 2020 included an extra week of activity. 
 On September 27, 2024, Jacobs Solutions Inc. ("Jacobs") completed the previously announced Reverse Morris Trust transaction pursuant to which (i) Jacobs first transferred its Critical Mission Solutions business CMS and portions of its Divergent Solutions DVS business (referred to herein as the Cyber Intelligence business C I and together with CMS referred to as the SpinCo Business ), to Amazon Holdco Inc., a Delaware corporation, that was subsequently renamed Amentum Holdings, Inc. SpinCo (the Separation ), (ii) Jacobs then effectuated a spin-off of SpinCo by distributing shares of SpinCo common stock, par value per share (the SpinCo Common Stock by way of a pro rata distribution to its shareholders such that each holder of shares of Jacobs common stock, par value per share, (the Jacobs Common Stock was entitled to receive share of SpinCo Common Stock for each share of Jacobs common stock held as of the record date, September 23, 2024 (the Distribution ), and (iii) finally, Amentum Parent Holdings LLC merged with and into SpinCo, with SpinCo surviving the merger (the Merger and together with the Separation and the Distribution, the Separation Transaction ). 
 As a result of the Separation, substantially all SpinCo Business-related assets and liabilities have been separated and distributed (the "Disposal Group"). The Company determined that the Disposal Group should be reported as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations because their disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. As such, the financial results of the SpinCo Business are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings as well as relevant disclosures as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, current and non-current assets and liabilities of the Disposal Group are reflected as held for spin in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 29, 2023 and no amounts remain held for spin as of September 27, 2024. See Note 14- Discontinued Operations for more information.

 to . T he Company s lease obligations are primarily for the use of office space and are primarily operating leases. Certain of the Company s leases contain renewal, extension, or termination options. The Company assesses each option on an individual basis and will only include options reasonably certain of exercise in the lease term. The Company generally considers the base term to be the term provided in the contract. None of the Company s lease agreements contain material options to purchase the leased property, material residual value guarantees, or material restrictions or covenants. 
 Long-term project asset and vehicle leases (leases with terms greater than twelve months), along with all real estate and IT asset leases, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid. Because the Company primarily acts as a lessee and the rates implicit in its leases are not readily determinable, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate on the lease commencement date to calculate the present value of future lease payments. Certain leases include payments that are based solely on an index or rate. These variable lease payments are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability and are initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date. Other variable lease payments, such as payments based on use and for property taxes, insurance, or common area maintenance that are based on actual assessments are excluded from the ROU asset and lease liability and are expensed as incurred. In addition to the present value of the future lease payments, the calculation of the ROU asset also includes any deferred rent, lease prepayments and initial direct costs of obtaining the lease, such as commissions. 
 Certain lease contracts contain non-lease components such as maintenance and utilities. The Company has made an accounting policy election, as allowed under ASC 842-10-15-37 and discussed above, to capitalize both the lease component and non-lease components of its contracts as a single lease component for all of its right-of-use assets.

 equity interest in the form of preferred and common shares of PA Consulting. The preferred shares are entitled to a cumulative annual compounding dividend based on the outstanding preferred share subscription price. These noncontrolling interest holders have certain option rights to put the preferred and common share interests back to the Company at a value based on the fair value of PA Consulting (the redemption values). The primary inputs and assumptions impacting the fair value of PA Consulting include projections of revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and discount rates applied thereto. Additionally, the Company has an option to call the interests for certain individual shareholders in certain circumstances. Because the interests are redeemable at the option of the holders and not solely within the control of the Company, the Company classified the interests in redeemable noncontrolling interests within its Consolidated Balance Sheet at their redemption values. The optional redemption features may become exercisable no earlier than from the March 2, 2021 closing date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events. 
 The Company has deemed these interests probable of becoming redeemable in the future and requiring their measurement at the greater of (i) the redemption amount that would be paid if settlement occurred at the balance sheet date, or (ii) the historical value resulting from the original acquisition date fair value plus the impact of any earnings or loss attribution amounts, including dividends. The fair value of the PA Consulting redeemable noncontrolling interest is determined using a combination of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, fair value is determined by using the projected discounted cash flows of PA Consulting. Under the market approach, the fair value is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to PA Consulting; the fair value is estimated based on the valuation multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

 We do not record a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the earnings meet the indefinite reversal criteria. The decision as to the amount of unremitted earnings that we intend to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries considers items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, and expected cash requirements in the U.S. As of September 27, 2024, we had not recognized a deferred tax liability on approximately million of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

 In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development "OEC ") released the Pillar Two Model Rules (also referred to as the global minimum tax or Global Anti-Base Erosion "GloBE " rules), which were designed to ensure large multinational enterprises pay a minimum 15 percent level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction in which they operate. Several jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted these rules, which are effective for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending September 26, 2025. The Company is continually monitoring developments and evaluating the potential impacts. At this time, the Company does not anticipate a material impact to income tax expense as a result of implementation of these rules. 
 The Company accounts for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. It accounts for interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as interest and penalties reported above the line (i.e., not as part of income tax expense). The main driver of the current year increase relates to uncertain tax positions on R D credits, which is offset by the release of uncertain tax positions whose statute of limitation expired during FY24. At September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, if recognized, million and million, respectively, would affect the Company s consolidated effective income tax rate. The Company had million and million in accrued interest and penalties at September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The Company estimates that, within twelve months, we may realize a decrease in our uncertain tax positions of approximately million as a result of concluding various tax audits and closing tax years. 
 The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by tax jurisdictions around the world. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities worldwide, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, India, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As of September 27, 2024, the Company has certain US tax returns open to audit from 2009 through 2011 and 2019 through 2023. For the jurisdictions outside the US, primarily UK and Australia, various returns are open for audit for tax years 2014 through 2023. Although the Company believes the reserves established for the tax positions are reasonable, the outcome of tax audits could be materially different, both favorably and unfavorably.

 Right-of-Use and Other Long-Lived Asset Impairment 
 During fiscal 2023, as a result of the Company's transformation initiatives, including the changing nature of the Company's use of office space for its workforce, the Company evaluated its existing real estate lease portfolio. These initiatives resulted in the abandonment of certain leased office spaces and the establishment of a formal plan to sublease certain other leased spaces that will no longer be utilized by the Company. In connection with the Company s actions related to these initiatives, the Company evaluated certain of its lease right-of-use assets and related property, equipment and leasehold improvements for impairment under ASC 360.

Deferred Compensation Plans 
 Our non-qualified deferred compensation programs provide benefits payable to directors, officers, and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future dates, upon retirement, or death. The plans are unfunded; therefore, benefits are paid from the general assets of the Company. Participants' cash deferrals earn a return based on the participants' selection of investments in several hypothetical investment options. Participants are also able to defer stock based compensation in the plans, which must remain invested in Company stock and are distributed in shares of Jacobs common stock. Since no investment diversification is permitted, changes in the fair value of Jacobs' common stock are not recognized. For the deferred compensation held in company stock, the number of shares needed to settle the liability is included in the denominator in both the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.)

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Jacobs Solutions Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jacobs Solutions Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

F-63 

Revenue Recognition for Certain Fixed-Price Contracts 
 Description of the Matter As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes contract revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, using the percentage-of-completion method (an input method) based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs. Revenue recognition under this method is judgmental, as it requires the Company to prepare estimates of total contract revenue and total contract costs, including costs to complete in-process contracts. 
 
 Auditing the Company s estimates of total contract revenue and costs used to recognize revenue on certain fixed-price contracts which are larger in size involved significant auditor judgment, as it required the evaluation of subjective factors, such as assumptions related to estimated labor, material and subcontractor costs. These assumptions involved significant management judgment, which affects the measurement of revenue recognized by the Company. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested the Company s controls over the estimation process that affect revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts. For example, we tested controls over management s monitoring and review of project cost estimates, including the Company s procedures to validate the completeness and accuracy of the data used to determine the estimates. 
 
 To test the Company s contract estimates related to revenues recognized on fixed-price projects, our audit procedures included selecting a sample of projects and, among other procedures, we obtained and inspected related contract agreements, amendments, and change orders to test the existence of customer arrangements and understand the scope and pricing of the related projects; observed selected project team status meetings at the Company and interviewed project team personnel to obtain an understanding of the status of operational performance and progress on the related projects; evaluated the reasonableness of the Company s estimated costs to complete by obtaining and analyzing supporting documentation for a sample of cost estimate components; and compared contract profitability estimates in the current year to historical estimates and actual performance for the same projects. 
 
 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
 Description of the Matter As of September 27, 2024, the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interest relating to the Company s PA Consulting subsidiary was 820.2 million. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the redeemable noncontrolling interests are subject to remeasurement as of the balance sheet date based on the greater of the redemption value or the historical value resulting from the original acquisition date fair value plus the impact of any earnings or loss attribution amounts, including dividends. The redemption value is based on the fair value of PA Consulting, which is determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis based upon projected financial information and a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. 
 
 Auditing the Company s redeemable noncontrolling interest balance requires significant judgment, as the valuation of the redemption value includes subjective estimates and assumptions. In particular, the discounted cash flow analysis used in determining the redemption value is sensitive to significant assumptions such as projections of revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic conditions. 

F-64 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s determination of the redemption value, including controls over management s review of the significant assumptions described above. 
 
 To test the redemption value, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company's valuation methodologies, performing recalculations of the model, and testing the significant assumptions described above and the underlying data used by the Company. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry trends and historical performance. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the redemption value resulting from changes in the significant assumptions. We also involved our valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the valuation methodologies and certain assumptions used by the Company. 
 
 /s/ 
 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1987.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Jacobs Solutions Inc. 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Jacobs Solutions Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Jacobs Solutions Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 2. Section 5.3 Death Prior to Completion of Retirement Benefit is amended to read in its entirety as follows 
 
 5.3 Death Prior to Completion of Retirement Benefit . The following rules apply with respect to a Participant s death after commencing, but prior to complete payout of, the Participant s Retirement Benefit 
 
 (a) Effective with respect to the portion of any Participant s Account Balance attributable to compensation deferred beginning January 1, 2018, the Participant's unpaid Retirement Benefit payments (i.e., the Participant s then-remaining vested Account Balance, subject to the Deduction Limitation) shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum as soon as practicable after the Participant s death. 
 
 (b) Effective January 1, 2024, with respect to Participants with deferral elections in effect for 2024 or subsequent years, the Participant's entire remaining unpaid Retirement Benefit payments, whether attributable to compensation deferred before or after January 1, 2018, but excluding any amounts considered grandfathered under Code section 409A, shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum as soon as practicable after the Participant s death.

Exhibit 10.15 

 (c) To the extent neither subsections (a) nor (b) above apply, a Participant s remaining Retirement Benefit payments shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the Plan document then in effect. In particular, amounts that are grandfathered under Code section 409A may be paid in a lump sum to the extent permitted by the applicable Plan document governing such grandfathered amounts.

Exhibit 10.15 

 (c) To the extent neither subsections (a) nor (b) above apply, a Participant s Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the Plan document then in effect. Specifically, Participants were required to elect on an Election Form whether the Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit attributable to the election shall be received by the Participant s Beneficiary in a lump sum or pursuant to an Annual Installment Method of up to 15 years.

For purposes of such election changes, the right to a series of installment payments shall be treated as the right to a single payment. If a Participant did not make any election with respect to the payment of a Deferral Amount or Employer Contribution (or, in either case, a portion thereof), then such amount shall be paid in a lump sum. The lump sum payment shall be made, or installment payments shall commence, thirty (30) days after the date of the Participant's death. 
 
 (d) Notwithstanding the timing set forth in subsections (a) through (c) above, the Plan may make, or begin, payment following the Participant s death to the extent that such payment is treated as being paid on the date specified in paragraph (a) through (c) as applicable under applicable Treasury Regulations, which permit payment to be made by December 31 of the first calendar year following the calendar year during which the death occurs. 
 
 (e) Any payment made shall be subject to the Deduction Limitation.

 4.3 Material Information Information is considered material if a reasonable investor would consider that information important in making a decision to buy, hold, or sell securities. Any information that could be expected to affect the Company s or another company s stock price, whether it is positive or negative, should be considered material. There is no bright-line standard for assessing materiality rather, materiality is based on an assessment of all of the facts and circumstances and is often evaluated by enforcement authorities with the benefit of hindsight. While it is not possible to define all categories of material information, some examples of information that should carefully be considered to determine whether they are material include the following 
 Projections of future earnings or losses, or other earnings guidance. 
 Changes to previously announced earnings guidance, or the decision to suspend earnings guidance. 
 A pending or proposed merger, acquisition, divestiture or tender offer. 
 A pending or proposed acquisition or disposition of a significant asset.

 The imposition of a ban on trading in Company Securities or the securities of another company. 
 4.4 Public Information Information that has not been disclosed to the public is generally considered to be non-public information. To establish that the information has been disclosed to the public, it may be necessary to demonstrate that the information has been widely disseminated. Information generally would be considered widely disseminated if it has been disclosed through the Dow Jones broad tape newswire services a broadcast on widely available radio, television, or webcast programs publication in a widely available newspaper, magazine, or news website or public disclosure documents filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that are available on the SEC s website. 
 Note Once information is widely disseminated, it is still necessary to afford the investing public with sufficient time to absorb the information. As a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed by the marketplace until two trading days after the information is released. If, for example, the Company were to make an announcement on a Tuesday before the securities markets open in the U.S., you should not trade in Company Securities until Thursday. Depending on the particular circumstances, the Company may determine that a longer or shorter period should apply to the release of specific material non-public information . 
 4.5 Relative A Relative means a spouse, domestic partner, child, child away at college, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents, grandparents, siblings, in-laws, and anyone else who lives in household of a person to whom this Policy applies. Relative also includes persons who do not live in the household of a person to whom this Policy applies but whose transactions in Company Securities are directed by or are subject to influence or control by a person to whom this Policy applies, such as parents or children.

 Engage in transactions in Company Securities, except as otherwise specified in this Policy under Transactions Under Company Plans (Section 8.1.5), Transactions Not Involving a Purchase or Sale (Section 8.1.6), and Rule 10b5-1 Plans (Section 6.6). 
 Recommend the purchase, holding or sale of any Company Securities. 
 Disclose material non-public information to persons within the Company whose jobs do not require them to have that information, or outside of the Company to other persons, including, but not limited to, family, friends, business associates, investors, and expert consulting firms, unless any such disclosure has been approved by the General Counsel. 
 Assist anyone engaged in the activities described in this section. 
 6.1.1 In addition, no Jacobs Personnel (or any other person designated by this Policy or by the General Counsel as subject to this Policy) who, in the course of working for the Company, learns of material non-public information about another public company, including a customer or supplier of the Company, whether located inside or outside the United States, will (a) trade in the securities of such company, (b) tip or disclose such material nonpublic information concerning that company to anyone, or (c) give trading advice of any kind to anyone concerning the other company. 
 6.2 Short Sales Short sales of Company Securities (the sale of a security that the seller does not own) or other economically equivalent transactions may evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value and therefore have the potential to signal to the market that the seller lacks confidence in the Company s prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce a seller s incentive to seek to improve the Company s performance. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Exchange Act, as amended, prohibits officers and directors from engaging in short sales (short sales arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by Section 6.5.4(d), Hedging Transactions). For these reasons, it is also a violation of Company policy for Jacobs Personnel to short sell any Company Securities. 
 6.3 Individual Responsibility. Persons subject to this Policy have ethical and legal obligations to maintain the confidentiality of information about the Company and to not engage in transactions in Company Securities while in possession of material non-public information. Each individual is responsible for making sure that he or she complies with this Policy and 
 Copyright 2024 Jacobs 

Insider Trading Page 5 of 13 
 JJ-LG-PL-9020-JJ Rev. 3 Effective Date 14-NOV-2024 

 that any Relative or entity under such individual s control whose transactions are subject to this Policy also comply with this Policy. In all cases, the responsibility for determining whether an individual is in possession of material non-public information rests with that individual, and any action on the part of the Company, the General Counsel, or any of its other employees or directors pursuant to this Policy (or otherwise) does not in any way constitute legal advice or insulate an individual from liability under applicable securities laws. Failure to fulfill ethical and legal obligations could result in severe legal penalties and disciplinary action by the Company for any conduct prohibited by this Policy or applicable securities laws, as described in more detail in Section 6.9, Consequences of Violations. Further, although not all Jacobs Personnel are prohibited from engaging in the types of transactions and arrangements described in Sections 6.5.2 and 6.5.4, these transactions and arrangements may lead to inadvertent violations of insider trading laws. Therefore, all Jacobs Personnel are strongly discouraged from entering into speculative transactions and other arrangements of the nature described in Sections 6.5.2 and 6.5.4. 
 6.4 Administration of the Policy. The Policy shall be administered by the General Counsel in such person s absence, the Vice President of Corporate Securities or another employee designated by the General Counsel shall be responsible for administration of this Policy. All determinations and interpretations by the General Counsel or his or her designee shall be final and not subject to further review. The General Counsel shall consult with the Chief Financial Officer with respect to any trading or pre-clearance of any Insider. 
 6.5 Additional Requirements and Prohibitions for Insiders. There is a heightened legal risk and or the appearance of improper or inappropriate conduct if Insiders subject to this Policy engage in certain types of transactions. It therefore is the Company s policy that Insiders must follow the requirements described in Sections 6.5.2 and 6.5.3. In addition, Restricted Persons must also follow the requirements described in Section 6.5.1 and must not engage in any of the transactions described in Section 6.5.4. 
 6.5.1 Pre-clearance for Restricted Persons 
 a. Restricted Persons, as well as the Relatives and Controlled Entities of such persons, will not engage in any transaction in Company Securities without first obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer. A request for pre-clearance should confirm that the trading person is not in possession of material non-public information and be submitted to the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer at least 2 business days in advance of the proposed transaction. Neither the General Counsel nor Chief Financial Officer is under any obligation to approve a transaction submitted for pre-clearance and may determine not to permit the transaction. If a person seeks pre-clearance and permission to engage in the transaction is denied, then he or she should refrain from initiating any transaction in Company Securities and should not inform any other person of the restriction. With respect to any request for pre-clearance of transactions in Company Securities by the General Counsel or 
 Copyright 2024 Jacobs 

Insider Trading Page 6 of 13 
 JJ-LG-PL-9020-JJ Rev. 3 Effective Date 14-NOV-2024 

 the Chief Financial Officer, or if either is unavailable to respond to a pre-clearance request within 2 business days, the Chief Executive Officer will substitute for the Chief Financial Officer and the Vice President of Corporate Securities will substitute for the General Counsel. 
 b. When a request for pre-clearance is made, the requestor should carefully consider whether he or she may be aware of any material non-public information about the Company or any company with which the Company does business and should describe fully those circumstances to the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer. 
 c. Under no circumstance may a person trade while aware of material non-public information about the Company, even if pre-clearance is granted. Thus, if you become aware of material non-public information after receiving pre-clearance, but before the trade has been executed, you must not effect the pre-cleared transaction. The Company s approval of any particular transaction under this pre-clearance procedure does not insulate any Restricted Person from liability under federal or state laws. Under the law, the ultimate responsibility for determining whether an individual is aware of material non-public information about the Company rests with that individual in all cases. 
 d. If the requestor is an executive Officer for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the requestor must indicate whether he or she has affected any non-exempt opposite way transactions within the past 6 months. Such persons should be prepared to report the proposed transaction on an appropriate SEC Form 4 (Statement of Changes of Beneficial Ownership of Securities) or Form 5 (Annual Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities. The requestor should also be prepared to comply with SEC Rule 144 and file SEC Form 144 (Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities Pursuant to Rule 144 Under the Securities Act of 1933), if necessary, at the time of any sale. 
 6.5.2 Standing and limit orders (except standing and limit orders under approved Rule 10b5-1 Plans, as described in Section 6.6) create heightened risks for insider trading violations similar to the use of margin accounts. There is no control over the timing of purchases or sales that result from standing instructions to a broker, and as a result the broker could execute a transaction when an Insider is in possession of material non-public information. The Company therefore discourages Insiders from placing standing or limit orders on Company Securities. If an Insider determines that he or she must use a standing order or limit order, the order should be limited to short duration and should otherwise comply with the restrictions and procedures noted in this section.

 6.5.3 Blackout Periods for Insiders 
 a. Quarterly Trading Restrictions Insiders, as well as their Relatives and Controlled Entities, will not conduct any transactions involving the Company s Securities (other than as specified by this Policy) during a Blackout Period beginning at the close of the trading day in the U.S. on the day that is 21 days prior to the last day of each fiscal quarter and ending two full trading days following the date of the public release of the Company s earnings results for that quarter (for example, for a fiscal period ending on December 31, the Blackout Period will start at the close of the trading day in the U.S. on December 10 and, if earnings are announced before trading commences on the following February 8, it will end after the market closes in the U.S. on February 9). In other words, these persons may only conduct transactions in Company Securities during the open trading period beginning on the second business day following the public release of the Company s quarterly earnings (exclusive of the day of the announcement) and ending on the day 22 nd day prior to the end of the current fiscal quarter. 
 Under certain very limited circumstances, a person subject to this restriction may be permitted to trade during a Blackout Period, but only if the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer conclude that the person does not in fact possess material non-public information. Insiders wishing to trade during a Blackout Period, including Insiders desiring to enroll in the ESPP, make any changes in their elections under the ESPP or sell any Company stock acquired under the ESPP during a Blackout Period, must contact the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer for pre-clearance approval at least 3 business days in advance of any proposed transaction involving Company Securities. 
 b. Event Specific Trading Restriction Periods From time to time, an event may occur that is material to the Company and is known by only a few Jacobs Personnel. So long as the event remains material and non-public, the persons designated by the General Counsel may not trade Company Securities. In addition, the Company s financial results may be sufficiently material in a particular fiscal quarter that, in the judgment of the General Counsel, designated persons should refrain from trading in Company Securities even sooner than the typical Blackout Period described in Section 6.5.3(a). In any of the foregoing situations, the General Counsel may notify these persons that they should not trade in the Company s Securities without disclosing the reason for the restriction. The existence of an event-specific trading restriction period or extension of a Blackout Period will not be announced to the Company as a whole and should not be communicated to any other person. Even if the General Counsel has not designated you as a person who should not trade due to an event-specific 
 Copyright 2024 Jacobs 

Insider Trading Page 8 of 13 
 JJ-LG-PL-9020-JJ Rev. 3 Effective Date 14-NOV-2024 

 restriction, you should not trade if you are aware of material non-public information. 
 c. Exceptions The quarterly trading restrictions and event-driven trading restrictions do not apply to those transactions to which this Policy does not apply, as described below in Transactions Under Company Plans (Section 8.1.5) and Transactions Not Involving a Purchase or Sale (Section 8.1.6). Further, the requirement for pre-clearance, the quarterly trading restrictions and event-driven trading restrictions do not apply to transactions conducted pursuant to approved Rule 10b5-1 plans, described in Rule 10b5-1 Plans (Section 6.6). 
 It is important to remember that trading in Company Securities outside of a Blackout Period or event-specific trading restriction should not be considered a safe harbor individuals must still refrain from trading at any time they are in possession of material non-public information. 
 6.5.4 Additional Restrictions Applicable to Restricted Persons 
 a. Short-term Trading Short-term trading of Company Securities may be distracting to a person and may unduly focus the person on the Company s short-term stock market performance instead of the Company s long-term business objectives. For these reasons, any Restricted Person who purchases Company Securities in the open market may not sell any Company Securities of the same class during the 6 months following the purchase. Conversely, a Restricted Person who sells Company Securities in the open market may not purchase Company Securities of the same class during the 6 months following the sale. Purchases through the ESPP or the receipt of Company Securities upon the vesting of equity awards are not considered open market purchases for the purpose of this section. 
 b. Publicly Traded Options Given the relatively short term of publicly traded options, transactions in options may create the appearance that a Restricted Person is trading based on material non-public information and focus a Restricted Person s attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company s long-term objectives. Accordingly, transactions in put options, call options or other derivative securities, on an exchange or in any other organized market, by a Restricted Person are prohibited by this Policy (option positions arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by Section 6.5.4(c), Hedging Transactions). 
 c. Hedging Transactions Hedging or monetization transactions can be accomplished through a number of possible mechanisms, including through the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds. Such hedging transactions may permit a Restricted Person to continue to own Company Securities obtained 
 Copyright 2024 Jacobs 

Insider Trading Page 9 of 13 
 JJ-LG-PL-9020-JJ Rev. 3 Effective Date 14-NOV-2024 

 through employee benefit plans or otherwise, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the Restricted Person may no longer have the same objectives as the Company s other shareholders. Therefore, Restricted Persons are prohibited from engaging in any such transactions. 
 d. Margin Accounts and Pledged Securities Securities held in a margin account as collateral for a margin loan may be sold by the broker without the customer s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Because a margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of material non-public information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Company Securities, Restricted Persons are prohibited from holding Company Securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging Company Securities as collateral for a loan (pledges of Company Securities arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by Section 6.5.4(c), Hedging Transactions). 
 e. In limited circumstances, a waiver of the restrictions provided in this Section 6.5.4 may be granted by the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer but only if the requestor has confirmed in writing to the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer that he or she is not aware of any material non-public information about the Company or any company with which the Company does business. 
 6.6 Rule 10b5-1 Plans 
 6.6.1 Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, as it may be amended from time to time (Rule 10b5-1), provides a defense from insider trading liability under Rule 10b-5. To be eligible to rely on this defense, a person subject to this Policy must enter into a Rule 10b5-1 plan for transactions in Company Securities that meets certain conditions specified in Rule 10b5-1 (a Rule 10b5-1 Plan). If the plan meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1, Company Securities may be purchased or sold without regard to certain insider trading restrictions. In general, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be documented in writing and entered into at a time when the person entering into the plan is not aware of material non-public information. To comply with this Policy, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be approved by the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer prior to being entered into and comply with applicable federal and state laws, including Rule 10b5-1. Any person seeking to enter into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must certify in writing that, on the date of adoption of the plan, such person (a) is not in the possession of, or aware of, material non-public information, (b) has complied with all requirements of this Policy and Rule 10b5-1 and (c) is adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or schedule to evade the prohibitions of the Exchange Act. One of the factors that the General Counsel and Chief 
 Copyright 2024 Jacobs 

Insider Trading Page 10 of 13 
 JJ-LG-PL-9020-JJ Rev. 3 Effective Date 14-NOV-2024 

 Financial Officer may consider in determining whether to approve a Rule 10b5-1 Plan is compliance with the Company s applicable minimum stock ownership guidelines. Once the plan is adopted, the person must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded, or the date of the trade. The plan must specify the amount, pricing, and timing of transactions in advance. 
 6.6.2 Any Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be submitted for approval 5 business days prior to the entry into the Rule 10b5-1 Plan and must otherwise comply with all applicable SEC regulations and requirements governing such plans. No further pre-approval of transactions conducted pursuant to the Rule 10b5-1 Plan will be required. 
 6.6.3 Any modification or termination of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan previously approved by the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer will require approval by the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer. The General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer may require as a condition to such approval that the modification or termination occur during an open trading window and that the person re-certify that they are not aware of material non-public information. 
 6.6.4 The acceptance by the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan does not, however, mean that it automatically meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 or that persons adopting such plan will be insulated from insider trading liability it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure compliance with insider trading laws and regulations, including Rule 10b5-1. 
 6.7 Post-Termination Transactions. This Policy continues to apply to transactions in Company Securities by the persons specified in Section 2.2 even after termination of service to the Company by a Jacobs Personnel. If an individual is in possession of material non-public information when his or her service terminates, the persons specified in Section 2.2 will not trade in Company Securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. The pre-clearance requirements specified in Section 6.5, Additional Requirements and Prohibitions for Insiders, will cease to apply to transactions in Company Securities upon the expiration of any Blackout Period or other Company-imposed trading restrictions that are in effect at the time of the termination of service. 
 6.8 Transactions by the Company. The Company is also prohibited from trading in securities of the Company or other companies with which the Company does business in violation of applicable federal or state insider trading laws. 
 6.9 Consequences of Violations. 
 6.9.1 The purchase or sale of securities while aware of material non-public information, or the disclosure of material non-public information to others who then trade in the Company s Securities, is prohibited by federal and state laws. Insider trading violations are pursued vigorously by the SEC, U.S. criminal authorities, and state enforcement authorities as well as under the laws of foreign jurisdictions. Punishment for insider trading violations is severe and could include significant 
 Copyright 2024 Jacobs 

Insider Trading Page 11 of 13 
 JJ-LG-PL-9020-JJ Rev. 3 Effective Date 14-NOV-2024 

 fines and imprisonment. While the regulatory authorities concentrate their efforts on the individuals who trade, or who tip inside information to others who trade, the federal securities laws also impose potential liability on companies and other controlling persons if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading by company personnel. 
 6.9.2 In addition, an individual s failure to comply with this Policy may subject the individual to Company-imposed sanctions and disciplinary action, including dismissal for cause, whether or not the employee s failure to comply results in a violation of law. A violation of law or even an SEC investigation that does not result in prosecution can tarnish a person s reputation and irreparably damage a career. 
 6.10 Questions or Reporting Suspected Violations Jacobs has an open-door policy for all employees and encourages open communication, feedback, and discussion. Employees are expected to proactively seek interpretations or advice on the best course of action. If you have questions regarding this Policy or securities laws generally, please contact the General Counsel or the Vice President of Corporate Securities. Suspected violations must be reported, and employees have many ways to do so. Jacobs Personnel may contact their supervisors, Human Resources, the Legal Department or the Ethics and Compliance Department directly or at compliance jacobs.com or through the Jacobs Integrity Hotline at integrity.jacobs.com or at telephone number +1(844) 543-8351 or askaquestion jacobs.com . 
 Reports of misconduct will be investigated and employee cooperation in investigations is required. Failure to report a violation of this Policy will be treated as a violation. Retaliation against anyone who reports a potential violation of this Policy in good faith is prohibited and will not be tolerated. No one will be reprimanded, or otherwise punished, for raising questions in good faith related to any transaction or potential concern. Nothing in this policy limits your right to report matters to a government entity, including the SEC. Throughout any internal investigations, Jacobs will maintain confidentiality, to the extent possible, based on its legal and ethical responsibilities.

 8.0 FIGURES, TABLES, AND OTHER ATTACHMENTS 
 8.1 Transactions Subject to this Policy 
 8.1.1 Company Securities. This Policy applies to transactions in the securities of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to in this Policy as Company Securities), whether beneficially held directly or through a 401(k) account, brokerage account or through another third party, including (but not limited to) common stock, options to purchase common stock, or any other type of securities that the Company or any of its subsidiaries may issue, such as preferred stock, convertible debentures, bonds and warrants, as well as derivative securities that are not issued by the Company, such as exchange traded put or call options or swaps relating to the Company Securities. 
 8.1.2 Other companies where the Company s personnel have material non-public information. This Policy also applies to transactions in the securities of a company by a person who, in the course of working for the Company, learns of material non-public information about that company. 
 8.1.3 Transactions by Relatives and Others. This Policy applies to transactions by a Relative of any person who is subject to this Policy as if the transaction was undertaken by that person on their own account. Persons subject to this Policy should make their Relatives aware of the application of this Policy and for the need for Relatives to advise should they intend to undertake a transaction. This Policy does not, however, apply to personal securities transactions of Relatives where the purchase or sale decision is made by a third party not controlled by, influenced by, or related to you or your Relatives. 
 8.1.4 Transactions by Entities that You Influence or Control. This Policy applies to transactions by any entities influenced or controlled by a person who is subject to this Policy, including any corporations, partnerships, or trusts (collectively referred to as Controlled Entities). 
 8.1.5 Transactions under Company Plans 
 a. Employee Stock Options This Policy does not apply to the exercise of an employee stock option acquired pursuant to the Company s equity incentive plans, or to the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which a person has elected to have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements. This Policy does apply, however, to any sale of stock as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an employee stock option, or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option. This Policy also applies to the subsequent sale of stock received in connection with the exercise of a stock option. 
 b. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units This Policy does not apply to the vesting of restricted stock awards or restricted stock units, or 
 Copyright 2024 Jacobs 

Insider Trading Page 13 of 13 
 JJ-LG-PL-9020-JJ Rev. 3 Effective Date 14-NOV-2024 

 the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of any restricted stock. The Policy does apply, however, to any market sale of restricted stock or the shares of stock received in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units. 
 c. Employee Stock Purchase Plan This Policy does not apply to purchases of Company Securities in the employee stock purchase plan resulting from your periodic contribution of money to the plan pursuant to the election you made at the time of your enrollment in the plan.

 8.1.6 Transactions not Involving a Purchase or Sale. Bona fide gifts are not transactions subject to this Policy unless the person making the gift has reason to believe that the recipient intends to sell the Company Securities while the officer, employee, or director is aware of material non-public information, or the person making the gift is subject to the trading restrictions specified in Section 6.5, Additional Requirements and Prohibitions for Insiders, and the sales by the recipient of the Company Securities occur during a blackout period. 
 8.2 Insiders 
 This section and Annex A may be revised without triggering a review of all sections of the Insider Trading Policy at the authority of the following General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer.
