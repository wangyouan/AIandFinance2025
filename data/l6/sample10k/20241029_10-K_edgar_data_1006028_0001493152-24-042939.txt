Summary
of Material Risks Associated with Our Business 

Our
business is subject to a number of risks that if realized could materially affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial
condition. These risks are discussed more fully in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report. These risks include
the following: 

Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. 

We have a history of losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. 

Raising
 additional funds by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders,
 restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. 

We need to continue to increase customer awareness and adoption of our food safety product offerings, PURE 
Hard Surface, a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant designed for restaurant chains, food processors, and transportation companies,
and PURE Control, a direct food contact processing aid. 

We
 may not be able to correctly estimate our future revenues and operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls, and require
 us to secure additional financing sooner than planned. 

Our
 quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. 

If
 we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and the United
 States Department of Agriculture, or the USDA, or if such efforts are delayed, our ability to commercialize PURE Control as a direct
 food contact processing aid will be harmed and our business and operating results will suffer. 

A
 loss of one or more of our key customers could adversely affect our business. 

We
 are dependent on our core silver dihydrogen citrate, or SDC, technology and if our efforts to achieve or maintain market acceptance
 of our core SDC technology are not successful, we are unlikely to continue to maintain profitability. 

We
 are subject to intense competition in the food safety market. 

We
 have limited sales, marketing and product distribution experience. 

We
 are dependent on a third-party, over whom we have limited control, to manufacture our SDC-based products. 

We
 rely on third parties to develop SDC-based products, and they may not do so successfully or diligently. 

We
 are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes, and our
 or our partners, including our third-party manufacturers failure to comply with applicable quality standards could affect
 our ability to commercialize SDC products. 

The
 industries in which we operate are heavily regulated. 

If
 we are unable to obtain, maintain or defend the patent and other intellectual property rights relating to our technology, we or our
 collaborators and distributors may not be able to develop and market proprietary products based on our technology, which would have
 a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

PART
I 

Item
1. Business 

Overview 

We
are dedicated to developing and commercializing proprietary antimicrobial products that address health and environmental challenges related
to pathogen and hygienic control. Our technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver, and our initial products contain
Silver Dihydrogen Citrate, or SDC. This broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent is available in liquid form and various concentrations,
distinguished by its superior efficacy, reduced toxicity, non-causticity, and the inability of bacteria to develop resistance. 

Our
SDC-based disinfecting and sanitizing products are registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, the United
States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and Health Canada. In addition to manufacturing and distributing these products, we also
supply SDC-based formulations as raw material ingredients for personal care products. 

We
see significant market opportunities for our safe and effective SDC-based solutions, particularly in the food industry. Our registered
offerings include PURE Hard Surface, a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant designed for restaurant chains, food processors,
and transportation companies, as well as PURE Control , a direct food contact processing aid. Our products are sold directly to end-use
customers, as well as third-party distributors who market and sell our products across various industries, maximizing our reach and impact. 

Technology
Platform 

Silver
as an Antimicrobial 

Our
patented molecule, SDC, represents one of the first significant advancements in antimicrobials in decades. SDC is an electrolytically
generated source of stabilized ionic silver, making it a versatile foundation for a variety of products across diverse markets. Colorless,
odorless, tasteless and non-caustic, the aqueous SDC formulates well with other compounds. We produce and market pre-formulated, ready-to-use
product, as well as varying strengths of SDC concentrate as an additive or raw material for inclusion in other products. 

Stability 

SDC
is a stabilized silver ion complex with a shelf life of several years. The unique bond between the silver ion in SDC allows the silver
ion to remain in solution while at the same time making it more bio-available for antimicrobial action. 

Mode
of Action 

SDC
kills microorganisms by two modes of action: 1) the silver ion deactivates structural and metabolic membrane proteins leading to
microbial death; and 2) the microbes view SDC as a food source, allowing the silver ion to enter the microbe. Once inside the
organism, the silver ion denatures the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, which halts the microbe s ability to replicate and leads
to its death. This dual action makes SDC highly and quickly effective against a broad spectrum of microbes. 

4 

Safety
and Toxicity Categories 

SDC
is non-toxic, non-caustic, colorless, odorless, tasteless and does not produce toxic fumes. While SDC is highly toxic to bacteria,
fungi and viruses it is non-toxic to humans and animals. Based on the EPA toxicity categorization of antimicrobial products at use
dilutions, that range from Category I (high toxicity) down to Category IV (no/low toxicity), SDC is rated in the lowest toxicity
category, Category IV, while traditional disinfectants fall into Categories I and II. 

The
following table shows the EPA toxicity categories and required signal words.

PURE 
Hard Surface is a Category IV product for which no signal words are required. 

Limitations
of Existing Food Safety Solutions 

The
United States, or U.S., food industry continues to rely on the use of toxic chemicals as processing aids or interventions during food
processing operations for which pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant and rendering current interventions less efficacious.
Most of these chemicals carry various warning labels for their toxic and/or caustic characteristics, which can negatively affect the
safety of processing plant personnel, plant operating equipment and the plant environment and its surroundings. 

Currently
used chemicals in food processing include peracetic acid, acidified sodium chlorite, ozone, and chlorine dioxide. Some of these chemicals
can be difficult to work with as a processing aid as they require heating to become effective or are difficult to mix and stabilize prior
to use. Some of these chemicals damage the food being processed, leading to reduced yields and their effectiveness is often limited to
specific pathogens or foods. Additionally, some of these chemicals can produce noxious fumes that over time have been linked to upper
respiratory illness and typically require in-plant decontamination of their effluence. 

Natural
and Environmentally Responsible 

SDC
is made of simple and all-natural ingredients: water, citric acid and minute amounts of ionic silver. SDC does not present a threat to
the environment. If introduced to wastewater systems, the low concentrations of ionic silver in SDC would react with naturally present
substances such as chlorides, sulfides and organic matter. These reactions would create insoluble silver complexes and render the silver
inert. In addition, SDC is manufactured through a zero waste process in which no byproducts or environmental effluent are
created. 

5 

Business
Strategy 

Our
goal is to establish a sustainable company by commercializing SDC-based products developed through our proprietary technology platform.
We aim to deliver leading antimicrobial solutions that tackle food safety risks across the entire food industry supply chain. Our products

we believe that we have developed our technology independently and have not infringed, and do not infringe, on the patents of others,
third parties may make claims that our technology does infringe on their patents or other intellectual property. In the event of infringement,
we may, under certain circumstances, be required to modify our infringing product or process or obtain a license. We may not be able
to do either of those things in a timely manner if at all, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition, we may not have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation
action or to defend ourselves against such actions brought by others. If any of the products we develop infringe upon the patent or proprietary
rights of others, we could, under certain circumstances, be enjoined or become liable for damages, which would have a material adverse
effect on our business. We also use confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to safeguard proprietary information but recognizes
the risk of breaches or inadequacies in these agreements. 

Additionally,
the Company holds registered trademarks for several brands, including PURE Bioscience , PURE , SILV RION ,
Powered by SDC Ag+ and PURE Control . Some previously held trademarks have been abandoned as they no longer align with the
Company s strategy. 

Research
and Development 

We
prioritize innovation as a key element of our business strategy and long-term success. We aim to leverage our technology platform to
create additional proprietary products and applications, including both end-use products and raw material formulations. Most research
and development activities are conducted in-house, complemented by independent testing from third-party laboratories. We also collaborate
with development partners who invest in specific product and process research using our SDC technology. 

Sales
and Marketing 

A
critical aspect of our business strategy is to leverage the industry experience of our internal sales force, the members of our
Board of Directors, or Board, and our management team in order to maximize the commercial potential of our technology platform in
the food industry. We are also working in tandem with numerous distribution partners to service existing customers and secure new
customers. 

Additionally,
we plan to form selective partnerships with industry leaders to enhance product commercialization both domestically and internationally,
leveraging partners resources for broader market reach. We believe our SDC-based products offer superior pathogen control compared
to traditional chemical solutions, which often have higher toxicity.

Sales
Concentration 

Net
product sales were 1,955,000 and 1,871,000 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 84,000
was attributable to increased sales across our end-user network servicing the food processing industry. Our top three customers accounted
for 678,000 of net product sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. For
the year ended July 31, 2024, one customer accounted for 20 of our net product sales. No other individual customer accounted for 10 
or more of our net product sales. There were no foreign sales during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. 

From
time to time, one or a small number of our customers may represent a significant percentage of our revenue. Our largest customer accounted
for 20 of our revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. Although we have agreements with many of our customers, these agreements
typically do not prohibit customers from purchasing products and services from competitors. A decision by any of our major customers
to significantly reduce the amount of product ordered or license fees paid, or their failure or inability to pay amounts owed to us in
a timely manner, or at all, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. 

Competition 

Since
SDC is a novel antimicrobial technology, our success hinges on gaining market share from established products. Even if SDC demonstrates
technological advantages, substantial investments are needed to displace traditional technologies offered by well-known industry leaders. 

Moreover,
SDC-based products, particularly those with higher silver ion concentrations, are generally more expensive to produce than existing chemicals,
which may deter customers from purchasing them, despite their superior efficacy. Customers may also find that the benefits of SDC products
(such as being non-toxic and non-caustic) are insufficient to justify the higher costs compared to lower-priced alternatives. 

Government
Regulation 

Our
business is subject to various government regulations relating to the protection of public health and the environment. Among these are
laws that regulate the manufacture, storage, distribution and labeling of our products, as well as the use, handling, storage and disposal
of certain materials in the manufacturing of our products. 

Requirements
Imposed by the EPA and Similar State Agencies 

We
manufacture and sell in the U.S. certain disinfecting products that kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi). The manufacture,
labeling, handling and use of these products are regulated by the EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act,
or FIFRA. We currently sell three products registered by the EPA under FIFRA, certain of which are approved for use on food contact surfaces
and others of which are approved for use on non-food contact hard surfaces. EPA product registration requires meeting certain efficacy,
toxicity and labeling requirements and paying ongoing registration fees. 

Although
states do not generally impose substantive requirements different from those of the U.S. EPA, each state in which our products are sold
requires registration and payment of a fee. California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs applicable
to these types of products that, in some cases, impose a fee on total product sales in the state. 

Based
on our experience and our knowledge of current trends, we expect the costs and delays in receiving necessary federal and state approvals
for these types of products may increase in the coming years. 

Requirements
Imposed by Ingredient Legislation 

Numerous
federal, state and local laws regulate the sale of products containing certain identified ingredients that may impact human health and
the environment. For instance, California has enacted Proposition 65, which requires the disclosure of specified listed ingredient chemicals
on the labels of products. Although none of the ingredients in our current products are reportable under Proposition 65, this and other
similar legislation may become more comprehensive in the future and/or new products we may develop could be subject to these regulations. 

10 

Requirements
Imposed by Other Environmental Laws 

A
number of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws govern the use, handling, storage and disposal of certain materials.
Our current manufacturing process for SDC-based products is a zero waste process, meaning that no byproducts are created,
and we do not use hazardous materials, as defined by applicable environmental laws, in the manufacturing of these products. As such,
some of these U.S. environmental laws are not generally applicable to us in their current form. However, these laws may in the future
identify, as hazardous materials certain materials that we use in our manufacturing processes, or we may opt to or be forced to change
our manufacturing procedures in a way that subjects our products or operations to these laws. 

Requirements
Imposed by the U.S. FDA and USDA 

Various
laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products we manufacture
and sell for controlling microbial growth in or on foods. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the
FDA. However, the USDA and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied directly to food as it pertains to
poultry and meats. 

Regulation
Outside the United States 

The
commercialization of SDC-based products in countries other than the U.S. may require that we, or companies with whom we partner for such
foreign commercialization, obtain necessary approvals from foreign regulatory authorities comparable to the EPA, FDA and USDA,
among others. Applicable approval processes and ongoing requirements vary from country to country and may involve more time and expense
than that required to obtain approvals in the U.S. In international markets, we currently sell our products under active registrations
held by us, or by our distributors. We intend to continue to process registrations ourselves or through distributors as required. 

We
currently hold a registration from Health Canada for our disinfectant product. We also have received a Letter of No Objection from Health Canada for our antimicrobial food processing aid on fruits and vegetables intended for processing. Additionally, an opinion
has been granted under the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products to sell SDC in the European Union for use in cosmetics, which includes
personal care products. 

Human
Capital 

As
of October 29, 2024, we have 11 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. We believe we have successfully attracted skilled and experienced
talent; however, the competition for qualified personnel is fierce, and we cannot guarantee our ability to retain or attract them in
the future. None of our employees are part of collective bargaining agreements, and we maintain positive relations with our team. We
are committed to fostering a culture that promotes the values, behaviors, and attributes essential for advancing our business and executing
our strategy.

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

You
should carefully consider the following information about risks and uncertainties that may affect us or our business, together with the
other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto.
If any of the following events, described as risks, actually occur, either alone or taken together, our business, financial condition,
results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market
price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our securities. An investment in our securities
is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should not invest in our securities if you cannot bear the economic risk of your
investment for an indefinite period of time and cannot afford to lose your entire investment. There may be additional risks that we do
not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position. 

11 

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

As
a result of our historical lack of financial liquidity, we do not currently have sufficient working capital to fund our planned operations
and may not be able to continue as a going concern. 

We
have a history of recurring losses, and as of July 31, 2024 we have incurred a cumulative net loss of 137.0 million. During the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2024, we recorded a net loss of 3.4 million on recorded net revenue of 1.96 million. In addition, during the year
ended July 31, 2024 we used 2.5 million in operating activities resulting in a cash balance of 349,000 as of July 31, 2024. As a result,
our existing cash resources are not sufficient to meet our anticipated needs over the next twelve months from the date hereof, and we
will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations and to implement our business plan, which capital may not be available
on acceptable terms or at all. 

Our
capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others: 

the
 market acceptance of, and demand for, our products; 

the
 timing and costs of executing our sales and marketing strategies; 

our
 ability to successfully complete the in-plant validation trials requested by potential customers and our ability to convert these
 trials into customer orders for our products; 

the
 costs and time required to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our products, including the required USDA approvals; 

the
 extent to which we invest in new testing and product development, including in-plant optimization trials; 

the
 extent to which our customers continue to place product orders as expected and expand their existing use of our products; 

the
 cost and time to satisfy unique customer requirements regarding validation trials or to support the value proposition and benefits
 of our products; 

the
 timing of vendor payments and the collection of receivables, among other factors affecting our working capital; 

our
 ability to control the timing and amount of our operating expenses, including the costs to attract and retain personnel with the
 skills required to implement our business plan; and 

the
 costs to file, prosecute and defend our intellectual property rights. 

The
above factors, along with our history and near term forecast of incurring net losses and negative operating cash flows, raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not obtain additional capital from external sources, we will not have
sufficient working capital to fund our planned operations or be able to continue as a going concern. We cannot assure you that additional
financing will be available when needed or that, if available, we can obtain financing on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders.
If we continue to raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would
likely continue to result. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash
payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. Further,
any contracts or license arrangements we enter into to raise funds may require us to relinquish our rights to our products or technology,
and we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any such contracts or license arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all.
Having insufficient funds may require us to delay or scale back our marketing, distribution and other commercialization activities or
cease our operations altogether. 

12 

We
have a history of losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. 

We
had a loss of 3.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, and a loss of 4.0 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023.
As of July 31, 2024, we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately 137.0 million. Although we believe we are making progress
on implementing our business plan focused on the food safety market, we expect to continue to have losses in future periods. None of
our existing agreements, including those with Packers Sanitation Services, Inc, Subway and Chipotle, contain provisions that provide
for fixed or minimum revenues. If the penetration into the marketplace of PURE Hard Surface, PURE Control and our other SDC-based products
is unsuccessful, our revenue growth is slower than anticipated or our operating expenses exceed expectations, we may not achieve profitability,
and we may never achieve profitability again. Slower than anticipated revenue growth could force us to reduce our sales and marketing
efforts, our product testing and optimization, and our product development and regulatory initiatives, and/or force us to reduce the
size and scope of our operations, to sell or license our technologies to third parties, or to cease operations altogether. Given our
recent introduction of our SDC-based products in the food safety market, we are unable to predict the extent of any future income or
our future losses and we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis. 

Raising
additional funds by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders,
restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. 

We
may need to increase our liquidity and capital resources in future periods. We have a history of raising funds through offerings of our
common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and we may in the future raise additional funds through public or private
equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements. For example, during fiscal year ended July
31, 2024, we completed a private placement convertible debt financing to accredited investors, in which we raised net proceeds of 1.8
million. To the extent that we continue to raise additional capital by issuing debt or equity securities, our stockholders ownership
will be diluted. Additionally, any debt financing we obtain may involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants
may include, among other things, limitations on borrowing, specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on
our ability to create liens on our assets, pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock or make investments. In addition, if we raise
funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us or
relinquish potentially valuable rights to our products or proprietary technologies. We may be required in future collaborations to relinquish
all or a portion of our sales and marketing rights with respect to our products or license intellectual property that enable licensees
to develop competing products in order to complete any such transaction. 

As
of October 29, 2024, we had 141,522,923 shares of common stock issued and outstanding or reserved for issuance under equity
compensation plans, vested and unvested options, unvested restricted stock units and convertible debt. Our current authorized
capital stock is limited to 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Any increase in our
authorized capital stock would require the approval of a majority of our shareholders as well as the approval of our Board of Directors, or Board. If we
were unable to increase our authorized capital stock for any reason, our ability to raise additional capital through the issuance of
equity or convertible debt would be severely compromised and we may be unable to obtain equity or convertible debt capital at
all. 

13 

We
need to continue to increase customer awareness and adoption of our food safety product offerings, PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control. 

Our
success will depend on our ability to continue to increase customer awareness and adoption of our food safety product offerings, PURE
Hard Surface and PURE Control. We have encountered and likely will continue to encounter risks and difficulties associated with introducing
or establishing new commercial products in this highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. These risks include the following, among
others: 

we
 may not be successful in demonstrating the effectiveness of PURE Control in actual in-plant use situations or satisfy the requirements
 of our potential customers; 

we
 may not be successful in converting in-plant trials into customer product orders; 

our
 SDC-based product offerings (especially at higher silver-ion concentrations) are typically more expensive to produce than existing
 treatment chemicals, and as a result, customers may not purchase our products for cost reasons, even if we are successful in demonstrating
 the superior efficacy or other benefits of our products; 

our
 customers may not continue to place product orders as expected or may not expand their use of our products; 

we
 may not be successful in demonstrating the value proposition of our products, including their non-corrosive and non-toxic characteristics
 and their neutral to positive processing yield impact; 

we
 may not succeed in materially penetrating the food safety markets with our SDC products and technology; 

we
 may not be successful in developing an effective sales and marketing infrastructure to commercialize our products; 

we
 may not generate sufficient revenues or raise sufficient funds to support our operations or the implementation of our business plan; 

we
 may not be successful in controlling our operating expenses; 

we
 may not be successful in obtaining any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis, or at all; 

we
 may not attract and retain key sales and marketing, technical and management personnel; 

we
 may not successfully comply with or maintain the regulatory approvals we obtain for our technology and products; 

we
 may not succeed in locating strategic partners and licensees of our technology; 

we
 may not effectively manage our anticipated growth, if any; and 

we
 may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property. 

Any
failure to successfully address these risks and uncertainties could seriously harm our business and prospects. 

14 

We
may not be able to correctly estimate our future revenues and operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls, and require us
to secure additional financing sooner than planned. 

We
may not correctly predict the amount or timing of future revenues and our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future
as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include: 

our
 expectations regarding revenues from sales of our products; 

the
 time and resources required to complete in-plant validation and optimization trials; 

the
 cost and time to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for additional products as part of our long-term business plan; 

the
 cost and time required to create effective sales and marketing capabilities and commercialization strategies; 

the
 expenses we incur to maintain and improve our platform technology; 

the
 cost and time to satisfy unique customer requirements regarding validation and optimization trials; 

the
 costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and 

the
 costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation
 costs and the results of such litigation. 

In
addition, our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning current and future revenues from sales of our
products and services, and from collaborations with third parties. However, we may not correctly predict the amount or timing of future
revenues. In addition, we may not be able to adjust our operations in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in our
revenues or we may increase our expenses as part of implementing our long-term business plan. As a result, a significant shortfall in
our planned revenues or a significant increase in our planned expenses could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our business
and financial condition. In such case, we may be required to issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into other commercial
arrangements, including relationships with corporate and other partners, sooner than anticipated to secure the additional financial resources
to support our development efforts and future operations. 

Our
quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. 

Because
of our limited operating history and the early commercial stage of our SDC-based products in the food safety market, we have limited
insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. Forecasting future revenues is difficult, especially because we have only
recent begun to generate meaningful revenues from the sale of our SDC-based products, our products are novel, and market acceptance of
our products is reliant on our customers confidence, based on scientific data and actual in-plant trials, that our product can
improve their food safety efforts. We often experience long sales cycles and our customers often require extensive evaluation and in-plant
trial periods before agreeing to use our products throughout their systems. In addition, fluctuations in the buying patterns of our current
or potential customers could significantly affect the level of our sales on a period to period basis. Additional factors that could cause
our financial results to fluctuate unexpectedly, including: the mix of product sales, the cost of product sales, our ability to meet
customer demand, delays in achieving our regulatory milestones, changes in our operating expenses, including non-cash expenses such as
the fair value of stock options granted to our employees, and manufacturing or supply issues. As a result, our quarterly operating results
may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. 

15 

A
loss of one or more of our key customers could adversely affect our business. 

From
time to time, one or a small number of our customers may represent a significant percentage of our revenue. For the year ended July 31,
2024, one individual customer accounted for 20 of our net product sales. Although we have agreements with many of our customers, these
agreements typically do not prohibit customers from purchasing products and services from competitors or contain minimum purchase obligations.
A decision by any of our major customers to significantly reduce the amount of product ordered or license fees paid, or their failure
or inability to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner, or at all, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. 

We
are dependent on our core SDC technology and if our efforts to achieve or maintain market acceptance of our core SDC technology are not
successful, we are unlikely to continue to maintain profitability. 

We
have and are currently focusing substantially all of our time and financial resources in the development and commercialization of our
core SDC technology to address food safety risks across the food industry supply chain. Although our SDC technology has applications
in multiple industries, we expect that sales of SDC and SDC-based products as a food safety solution will constitute a substantial portion,
or all, of our revenues in future periods. We are marketing our SDC-based products to restaurant chains, food manufacturers, food processors
and food transportation companies. Our SDC-based products have not yet been broadly accepted into the food safety market, and may never
be broadly accepted. Any material decrease or significant delay in the overall level of sales or expected sales of, or the prices for,
our SDC-based products, whether as a result of competition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, long sales cycles, change in customer
demands or requirements, or any other factor, would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. In addition, even if our products achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain product sales or other forms
of revenue over time if new products or technologies are introduced by competitors that are more favorably received than our products,
are more cost-effective or otherwise render our products less attractive or obsolete. 

We
are subject to intense competition in the food safety market. 

Our
SDC-based products compete in the highly competitive food safety market. Our SDC-based product offerings (especially at higher silver
ion concentration levels) are typically more expensive to produce than existing treatment chemicals, and as a result, customers may not
purchase our products for cost reasons, even if we are successful in demonstrating the superior efficacy of our products. In addition,
customers may determine that the other benefits offered by our products (e.g., non-toxic, non-caustic, and neutral to positive yield
impact) are not sufficient to overcome the lower cost products offered by our competitors. Further, most of our competitors have been
in business for a longer period of time than we have, and offer a greater number of products and services than we do and have greater
financial, technical, sales and other resources than we do. Many of our competitors already have well established brands and distribution
capabilities, and in some cases are able to leverage the sale of other products with more favorable terms for products competing with
our own. We also have significantly fewer sales personnel than virtually all of our competitors. Furthermore, recent trends in this industry
are for large food safety companies to consolidate into a smaller number of very large entities, which further concentrates financial,
technical and market strength and increases competitive pressure in the industry. If we directly compete with these very large entities
for the same markets and/or products, their financial strength could prevent or delay us from capturing a meaningful share of the food
safety market. It is also possible that developments by our competitors will make our technologies or products noncompetitive or obsolete.
Our ability to compete will depend upon our ability, and the ability of our distributors and other partners, to develop brand recognition,
develop the scientific and plant trial data to demonstrate the efficacy of our products, and to displace existing, established and future
products in our relevant target markets. We, or our distributors and partners, may not be successful in doing so, which would have a
materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

16 

We
have limited sales, marketing and product distribution experience. 

We
have limited experience in the sales, marketing and distribution of our products in the food safety market. We began to focus on the
food safety market in August 2013. After acquiring necessary regulatory approvals we began to commercialize our products in 2016. As
a result, our sales and marketing experience with these products are limited, and our current sales, distribution and marketing strategies
and programs may not be successful. Further, the sales cycle to secure a new customer is long and unpredictable. Potential customers
typically require that we complete extensive in-plant validation studies with our products. We may not be successful in demonstrating
the effectiveness of PURE Control in actual in-plant use situations or satisfy the requirements of our potential customers. Moreover,
we may not be successful in converting in-plant trials into customer product orders. We also have a relatively small sales and marketing
organization and a limited number of distributors. Therefore, we may not be able to establish the sales, marketing, and distribution
capabilities necessary to generate sales and build our business to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations and the implementation
of our business plan. 

We
are dependent on a third-party, over whom we have limited control, to manufacture our SDC-based products. 

On
June 9, 2019, we entered into a five-year strategic collaboration agreement with St. Louis-based Intercon Chemical Company, or ICC, where
we granted ICC the right to be the non-exclusive manufacturer for all our SDC-based products. We do not have any manufacturing facilities
and we currently rely on ICC to manufacture our SDC-based products and may in the future rely on one or more third-party manufacturers
to properly manufacture our products. We may not be able to quickly replace our manufacturing capacity if ICC is unable to manufacturer
our products as a result of a fire, natural disaster (including an earthquake), equipment failure or other difficulty, or if such ICC
facilities are deemed not in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, and the noncompliance could not be rapidly
rectified. ICC is our single manufacture for our concentrated SDC-based products and may not be replaced without significant effort and
delay in production. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond our current manufacturer s capabilities could harm our
ability to manufacturer such products until new manufacturers are identified and qualified, which would have a significant adverse effect
on our business and results. Any third-party manufacturer that we find may not match our quality standards or be able to meet customer
requirements. 

Additionally,
our inability or reduced capacity to have our products manufactured would prevent us from successfully evaluating or commercializing
our proposed products. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our products may adversely affect our profit margins
and our ability to develop and deliver proposed products on a timely and competitive basis. 

We
rely on third parties to develop SDC-based products, and they may not do so successfully or diligently. 

We
have granted ICC and other third parties to whom we license rights to our technology certain distribution and development rights to products
containing SDC for applications and markets outside the U.S. food safety market. Our reliance on ICC and other third parties for development
and distribution activities reduces our control over these activities. In such arrangements, we have relied, and expect in the future
to rely, on the third party to fund and direct product development activities and appropriate regulatory filings. Any of these third
parties may not be able to successfully develop such SDC-based products due to, among other factors, a lack of capital, a lack of appropriate
diligence, insufficient devotion to sales efforts, a change in the evaluation by the third party of the market potential for SDC-based
products, technical failures, and poorer than expected results from testing or trial use of any products that may be developed. If the
third parties on which we rely are not successful in such development activities, our business and operating results would be adversely
affected. 

17 

Pricing
and supply issues may have a material impact on our margins and our ability to supply our customers. 

All
of the supply ingredients used to manufacture our SDC-based products are available from multiple suppliers. However, commodity prices
for some ingredients can vary significantly and the margins that we are able to generate could decline if prices rise. For example, both
silver and citric acid prices have been volatile in recent periods. 

In
addition to such commodities, we also rely on producers of specialized packaging inputs such as bottles and labels for finished products.
Due to their specialized nature, the supply of such inputs can be periodically constrained and result in additional costs to obtain these
items, which may in turn inhibit our ability to supply products to our customers. 

We
are generally unable to increase our product prices to our customers, partners and distributors quickly in order to maintain our margins,
and significant price increases for key inputs could therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Price increases can
also result in lost sales, and any inability to supply our customers orders can lead to lost future sales to such customers. 

We
expect ICC to be the sole source supplier of our SDC concentrate and we may use other third parties to blend, package and provide fulfillment
activities for our finished products in future periods. We expect that our margins may be reduced by using ICC and other such third parties,
and our ability to maintain product quality may not be as extensive or effective as when we produce these products in our own facility(ies).
Any quality control issues could lead to product recalls and/or the loss of future sales, which would reduce our revenues and/or profits. 

If
we are not able to manage any growth we achieve effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed. 

In
order to implement our business plan and achieve and maintain market acceptance of our SDC-based products, we expect to expand our business
operations and hire additional sales and support personnel. We may not have sufficient resources to do so. If we hire additional personnel
and invest in additional infrastructure, we may not be effective in expanding our operations and our systems, procedures or controls
may not be adequate to support any such expansion. Failure to properly manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on our
business and our operating results. 

If
we suffer negative publicity concerning the safety or efficacy of our products, our sales may be harmed. 

If
concerns should arise about the safety or efficacy of any of our products that are marketed, regardless of whether or not such concerns
have a basis in generally accepted science or peer-reviewed scientific research, such concerns could adversely affect the market for
those products. Similarly, negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims, whether or not those claims
are supported by applicable law. 

We
may become subject to product liability claims. 

As
a business that manufactures and markets products for use by consumers and institutions, we may become liable for any damage caused by
our products, whether used in the manner intended or not, including potentially damage to our customers businesses. Regardless
of merit or potential outcome, product liability claims against us may result in, among other effects, the inability to commercialize
our products, impairment of our business reputation, and distraction of management s attention from our primary business. If we
cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims we could incur substantial liabilities. Although we maintain general
and product liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims and may not be adequate to indemnify for liabilities that
may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could harm our business
and operating results. 

We
depend on key personnel for our continued operations and future success, and a loss of certain key personnel could significantly hinder
our ability to move forward with our business plan. 

Our
success depends largely on the execution of our business strategy by our management team and the members of our Board. Our Board and
management will be evaluating how to best execute our near-term strategy to drive customer adoption in the food industry by addressing
food safety solutions across the supply chain in order to prevent or mitigate food contamination or the potential for food-borne illness
with specific customer focus in foodservice providers, food processors and food manufacturers. Our directors, executive officers and
key personnel could terminate their services with us at any time without notice and without penalty. Additionally, we do not maintain
key person life insurance policies on our directors, executive officers or other employees. The loss of one or more of our directors,
executive officers or key employees could seriously harm our ability to execute on our business strategy, which could harm our business,
results of operations, financial condition, and/or the market price of our common stock. We cannot assure you that in such an event we
would be able to recruit qualified personnel able to replace these individuals in a timely manner, or at all, on terms acceptable to
either us or to any qualified candidate. Even if we were able to replace any such individuals in a timely manner, if we are unable to
effectively integrate new executive officers or key employees, our operations and prospects could be harmed. 

18 

Because
competition for highly qualified sales and marketing and management personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the
employees we need to support our potential growth. 

To
successfully meet our objectives, we must attract and retain highly qualified sales and marketing and management personnel with specialized
skill sets focused on the industries in which we compete, or intend to compete. Competition for qualified business development and bioengineering
personnel can be intense. Our ability to meet our business development objectives will depend in part on our ability to recruit, train
and retain top quality people with advanced skills who understand our technology and business. In addition, it takes time for our new
personnel to become productive and to learn our business. If we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel, it will be difficult
for us to sell our products or to license our technology or to achieve or maintain regulatory approvals, and we may experience a shortfall
in revenue and not achieve our anticipated, or any, growth. 

We
may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our
management. 

From
time to time we may consider engaging in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing
or in-licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other
charges, may increase our near-and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or
business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational
and financial risks, including, among others, exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management s
time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies, difficulty and cost in combining the operations
and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel, and inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.
Accordingly, although we may not choose to undertake or may not be able to successfully complete any transactions of the nature described
above, any transactions that we do undertake or complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects. 

We
may invest or spend our cash in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a significant return. 

Our
management has considerable discretion in the use of our cash. Our cash may be used for purposes that do not increase our operating results
or market value. Until the cash is used, it may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value.
The failure of our management to invest or spend our cash effectively could result in unfavorable returns and uncertainty about our prospects,
each of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. 

We
may not be able to utilize all, or any, of our tax net operating loss carry-forwards and our future after-tax earnings, if any, could
be reduced. 

At
July 31, 2024, we had federal and state tax net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately 107.2 million and 65.9 million, respectively.
Utilization of these net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations
that may have occurred, including with respect to our recent private placements, or that could occur in the future, as required by Section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss
carry-forwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change,
as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period
resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public
groups. Since our formation, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions (both before and after
our initial public offering in 1996) which, combined with the purchasing stockholders subsequent disposition of those shares,
may have resulted in such an ownership change, or could result in an ownership change in the future based upon subsequent disposition.
While we believe that we have not experienced an ownership change, the pertinent tax rules related thereto are complex and subject to
varying interpretations, and thus the applicable taxing authorities may take an alternative position. 

Our
current federal tax loss carry-forwards began expiring in the year ended July 31, 2020 and, unless previously utilized, all but 9.1
million will completely expire in the year ending July 31, 2038. The 9.1 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Our state tax
loss carry-forwards begin to expire in the year ending July 31, 2029, and will completely expire in the year ending July 31,
2040.

Risks
Related to the Regulation of our Products 

If
we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals from the FDA and USDA, or if such efforts are delayed, our ability to commercialize
PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid will be harmed and our business and operating results will suffer. 

We
have received the required FDA approvals to market PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw poultry and fresh
produce and we have received a No Objection Letter from the USDA s Food Safety and Inspection Service granting
approval for SDC-based PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-on line
reprocessing, or OLR and post chill processing of fresh poultry. We have not, however, received the required
approval from the USDA to utilize PURE Control in OLR poultry processing. Further, even if we elect to seek regulatory approval,
there is no assurance we will be successful in obtaining the required approvals from the FDA and USDA to utilize PURE Control as a
direct food contact processing aid for raw meats, including beef and pork. If we are unable to obtain the required regulatory
approvals from the FDA and USDA, or if such efforts are delayed, our ability to commercialize PURE Control as a direct food contact
processing aid for poultry and as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meets will be restricted and our business and
operating results will suffer. 

The
industries in which we operate are heavily regulated. 

We
are focused on the marketing and continued development of our SDC antimicrobial technology for use in the food safety market. Our existing
products, PURE Control and PURE Hard Surface, and any additional products we develop based on our SDC technology in future periods, require
or will require approval by government agencies prior to marketing or sale in the U.S. or in foreign markets. Complying with applicable
government regulations and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals can be, and has historically been, time consuming and expensive,
due in part, we believe, to the novel nature of our technology. Regulatory review could involve delays or other actions adversely affecting
the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of our products. While we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any pending or future
regulatory review processes or the extent or impact of any future changes to legislation or regulations affecting review processes, we
expect such processes to remain time consuming and expensive as we, or our partners, apply for approval to make new or additional efficacy
claims for current products or to market new product formulations. Obtaining approvals for new SDC-based products in the U.S., or in
markets outside the U.S., could take several years, or may never be accomplished. 

SDC
is a platform technology rather than a single use applied technology. As such, products developed from the platform may fall under the
jurisdiction of multiple U.S. and international regulatory agencies. Our disinfectant and sanitizer products are regulated in the U.S.
by the EPA. In addition to the EPA, each of the 50 states in the U.S. has its own government agencies that regulate the sale or shipment
of our products into their state. We have obtained registration for these products from the EPA and all states into which such products
are currently marketed and sold. We are required to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and pay ongoing fees in
order to maintain such registrations. We may not be able to maintain these registrations in the future, which may eliminate our continued
ability to market and sell our products in some or all parts of the U.S. We also may not be able to obtain necessary registrations with
the EPA and applicable states for other SDC disinfectant and sanitizer products that we or our partners may develop, which would limit
our ability to sell any such products in the future. 

Some
potential applications of SDC, such as those aimed at healthcare, veterinary and certain food preparation markets, may require approval
of other government agencies prior to marketing or sale in the U.S. or in foreign markets, such as the FDA, or the USDA. Obtaining FDA and/or USDA approval is a complicated and expensive process
and such approvals may never be obtained for any SDC products. If FDA and/or USDA approvals are obtained, the approvals may limit the
uses for which SDC products may be marketed such that they may not be profitable to us, and the applicable products would be subject
to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and/or USDA that could lead to withdrawal or limitation of any product approvals. 

We
have managed and funded certain of our EPA-regulated product development internally, in conjunction with engaging regulatory consultants
and partnering with other third parties. We have partnered, or intend to partner, with third parties who are seeking, or intend to seek,
approvals to market SDC-based products in markets outside the U.S., and with other third parties who are developing FDA-regulated SDC-based
products who, upon such development, would seek FDA approvals of such products. Our ability to market and sell our products is dependent
on our and our partners ability to obtain and maintain required registrations and approvals of applicable regulatory agencies.
Failure by our partners or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines or the withdrawal of approval for us or our
partners and distributors to market our products in some or all jurisdictions or for certain indications, which could cause us to be
unable to successfully commercialize SDC or otherwise achieve revenues from sales of such products. 

20 

We
are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes, and our or
our partners, including our third-party manufacturers, failure to comply with applicable quality standards could affect our ability to
commercialize SDC products. 

The
EPA and other applicable U.S. and foreign government agencies regulate our and our partners systems and processes, including those
of ICC, for manufacturing SDC-based products. These regulations require that we and our partners observe good manufacturing practices 
in order to ensure product quality, safety and effectiveness. Failure by us or our partners to comply with current or future government
regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls or related field actions,
product shortages, and/or delays in product manufacturing, any or all of which could cause significant cost to us. Further, efficacy
or safety concerns and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products or those of our partners could lead to product recalls,
fines, withdrawal of approvals, and/or declining sales, any or all of which could result in our failure to successfully commercialize
SDC or otherwise achieve revenue growth. 

Litigation
or the actions of regulatory authorities may harm our business or otherwise distract our management. 

Substantial,
complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur major expenditures and would distract our management. For example, lawsuits against
us or our officers or directors by employees, former employees, stockholders, partners, customers, or others, or actions taken by regulatory
authorities, could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Such lawsuits and actions are not uncommon, and we may not
be able to resolve such disputes or actions on terms favorable to us, and there may not be sufficient capital resources available to
defend such actions effectively, or at all. 

Risks
Related to Our Intellectual Property 

If
we are unable to obtain, maintain or defend the patent and other intellectual property rights relating to our technology, we or our collaborators
and distributors may not be able to develop and market proprietary products based on our technology, which would have a material adverse
impact on our results of operations. 

We
rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright protections, as well
as contractual restrictions, to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business. 

Legal
protections of our intellectual property and proprietary rights afford only limited protection. For instance, we currently own twelve
U.S. patents related to our SDC technology. The lives of these patents, and any patents that we may obtain in the future, are not indefinite,
and the value to us of some or all of our patents may be limited by their terms. Further, although we have a number of U.S. and international
patent applications pending, some or all of those applications may not result in issued patents, and the intellectual property claims
therein would be unprotected. Additionally, obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on our compliance with various procedural,
document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced
or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. Furthermore, the patent positions of bioscience companies can be highly uncertain
and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions, and, therefore, we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be
able to ultimately enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our
patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might
not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe
our patents. 

In
addition, to the extent that we operate internationally, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the
same extent as the laws of the U.S. Many countries have a first-to-file trademark registration system, which may prevent
us from registering or using our trademarks in certain countries if third parties have previously filed applications to register or have
registered the same or similar trademarks. Additionally, changes in the patent and/or trademark laws or interpretations of such laws
in the U.S. or other countries could diminish the value of our intellectual property rights. Moreover, our competitors may develop competing
technologies that are not covered by the claims of, and therefore do not infringe upon, our issued patents, which could render our patents
less valuable to us. If our proprietary rights cannot be, or are not sufficiently, protected by patent and trademark registrations, it
could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize or license our technology and products. 

Our
own efforts to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may also be insufficient. Despite efforts to protect our
proprietary rights, including without limitation through confidentiality and other similar contractual restrictions, our means of protecting
such rights may not be adequate and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our proprietary technology, obtain and use information
that we regard as proprietary, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including
trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party
or if their secrecy is lost. It is possible that, despite our efforts, competitors or others will create and use products, adopt service
names similar to our service names or otherwise violate or misappropriate our proprietary rights. The infringement of such rights could
have a material negative impact on our business and on our results of operations. 

21 

Litigation
may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, which would be expensive and could consume time and
other resources. The result of any such litigation may be the court s ruling that our patents or other intellectual property rights
are invalid and/or should not be enforced. Additionally, even if the validity of such rights is upheld, the court could refuse to stop
a third party s infringing activity on the ground that such activities do not infringe our rights. The U.S. Supreme Court has recently
revised certain tests regarding granting patents and assessing the validity of patents to make it more difficult to obtain patents. As
a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised standards. Some of our patents may
be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in a reexamination proceeding, or during
litigation, under the revised criteria. 

We
may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights
and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use, our technology. 

If
we choose to go to court to attempt to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents, that individual or company
has the right to ask the court to rule that our patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits
are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In
addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other
party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse
to stop the other party on the ground that such other party s activities do not infringe our rights to these patents. 

Furthermore,
a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by the third party s patent rights and may file an injunction to stop
us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our products. These lawsuits are costly and could
affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide
that we are infringing the third party s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition,
there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party s patents. The biotechnology
industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover
various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation
is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either
do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this.
Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption
of validity enjoyed by issued patents. 

Because
some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, patent applications in the
United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and publications in the
scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for
technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. Our
competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent
application may have priority over our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering
such technologies. If another party has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to
participate in an interference proceeding declared by the United States Patent Trademark Office, to determine priority of invention in
the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful,
resulting in a loss of our United States patent position with respect to such inventions. 

Some
of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially
greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material
adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. 

22 

Third
parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products. 

Our
manufacture, use and sale of SDC-based products may subject us to lawsuits relating to the validity and infringement of patents or other
proprietary rights of third parties. Litigation may be costly and time-consuming, and could divert the attention of our management and
technical personnel. If we are found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property or
proprietary rights of others, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or
patented invention in our business and our obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement. If the rights holders are willing
to permit us to continue to use their intellectual property rights, it may be necessary for us to enter into license arrangements with
unfavorable terms and pay substantial amounts in royalty and other license fees. Either having to cease use or pay such fees could prevent
us, or our third-party manufacturer, from manufacturing and selling our products, which could make us much less competitive in our industry
and have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Confidentiality
agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and
may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete. 

We
may rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade
secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own.
We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators,
sponsored researchers and other advisors, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that
the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known
to the party by us during the course of the party s relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties
which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However,
these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party
illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable.
In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain
trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position. 

We
may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. 

As
is common in the biotechnology, food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other
biotechnology, food, chemical or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against
us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade
secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even
if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

Risks
Related to our Common Stock 

The
price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. 

Our
common stock is approved for quotation on the over-the -counter, or OTC Markets OTCQB marketplace, or OTCQB under the symbol
 PURE. The OTCQB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices and volume
information in over-the-counter equity securities and provides significantly less liquidity than a listing on the Nasdaq Stock
Markets or other national securities exchange. The OTCQB securities are traded by a community of market makers that enter quotes and
trade reports. This market is limited in comparison to the national stock exchanges and any prices quoted may not be a reliable
indication of the value of our common stock. Quotes for stocks included on the OTCQB are not listed in the financial sections of
newspapers as are those for the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE MKT. Therefore, prices for securities traded solely on the
OTCQB may be difficult to obtain. 

Trading
on the OTCQB as opposed to a national securities exchange has resulted and may continue to result in a reduction in some
or all of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and our company: 

the
 liquidity of our common stock; 

the
 market price of shares of our common stock; 

our
 ability to obtain financing to support our operations and the implementation of our business plan; 

the
 number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in shares of our common stock; 

the
 number of market markers in shares of our common stock; 

the
 availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of shares of our common stock; and 

the
 number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock. 

23 

The
price and trading volume of our common stock have historically been volatile. 

In
addition, the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to: 

actual
 or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations; 

announcements
 regarding the status of our regulatory efforts; 

the
 determination that our shares of common stock are penny stock which will require brokers trading in our shares of common
 stock to adhere to more stringent rules, likely resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market
 for our shares of common stock; 

the
 sale by us of our common or preferred stock or other securities, or the anticipation of sales of such securities; 

the
 trading volume of our common stock, particularly if such volume is light; 

the
 introduction of new products or services, or product or service enhancements by us or our competitors; 

developments
 with respect to our or our competitors intellectual property rights or regulatory approvals or denials; 

announcements
 of significant acquisitions or other agreements by us or our competitors; 

sales
 or anticipated sales of our common stock by our insiders (management and directors); 

conditions
 and trends in our industry; 

changes
 in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors; 

changes
 in the estimation of the future size and growth of our markets; and 

general
 economic conditions. 

In
addition, the stock market in general, the OTCQB, and the market for shares of novel technology companies in particular, have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that in some cases may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
In addition, this volatility could adversely affect an investor s ability to sell shares of our common stock, and/or the available
price for such shares, at any given time. 

Potential
sales or issuances of our common stock to raise capital, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause dilution to our current
stockholders and the price of our common stock to fall. 

We
have historically supported our operations through the issuance of equity and debt securities and may continue to do so in the future.
For example, during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, we completed a private placement convertible debt financing to accredited
investors, in which we raised net proceeds of 2.8 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the conversion price for
the convertible debt financing will be at least 0.115 per share and less than or equal to 0.23 per share. Although we may not be successful
in obtaining financing through equity or debt sales on terms that are favorable to us in the future, if at all, any such sales that do
occur could result in substantial dilution to the interests of existing holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial
number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities to any new investors, or the anticipation of such sales, could cause
the trading price of our common stock to fall. 

Our
common stock is deemed to be penny stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares due to suitability
requirements. 

Shares
of our common stock are subject to the so-called penny stock rules as that term is defined in Rule 3a51-1 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These requirements may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of
potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise
dispose of them. This could cause our stock price to decline. 

Broker-dealers
dealing in penny stocks are required to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stock. Moreover, broker-dealers
are required to determine whether an investment in a penny stock is a suitable investment for a prospective investor. Such requirements
may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could limit the market price and liquidity of our
common stock. 

24 

We
have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

The
continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable
future should not purchase our common stock. We have paid no cash dividends on any of our capital stock to date and we currently intend
to retain our available cash to fund the development and growth of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will
be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions
imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board deems relevant. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock
in the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, which may never occur. 

Anti-takeover
provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control and could also limit the market price
of our stock. 

Certain
provisions of our charter and bylaws, as amended, or Bylaws, may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and may prevent
or delay a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving us that is not approved by our Board, even if such events may be beneficial
to the interests of stockholders. For example, our Board, without stockholder approval, has the authority and power to authorize the
issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and such preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights that could adversely
affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock. Further, the one-for-eight reverse stock split of our outstanding common
stock that we effected on August 14, 2012 has increased the proportion of unissued and authorized common shares to issued and outstanding
common shares, which could allow our Board to issue large numbers of additional shares of our common stock that could significantly reduce
the voting power of our current stockholders. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting
stock. These and other provisions in our charter documents may make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to initiate
actions that are opposed by our then-current Board, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest or other
change of control transaction involving the Company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction could cause stockholders
to lose a substantial premium over the then-current market price of their shares. 

General
Risk Factors 

Compliance
with the reporting requirements of federal securities laws can be expensive. 

We
are a public reporting company in the United States, and accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act and other federal securities laws, including the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The costs of complying
with the reporting requirements of the federal securities laws, including preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other
information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders, can be substantial. 

If
we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent
fraud. As a result, the Company s stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which could harm our business and
the value of the Company s common shares. 

Effective
internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting. Our internal controls and financial
reporting are not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the exemption provided to issuers
that are not large accelerated filers or accelerated filers under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. We cannot be
certain that we will be successful in maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting and financial processes in
the future. We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. Furthermore, to the extent our business
grows, our internal controls may become more complex, and we would require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls
remain effective. If we or our independent auditors discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied,
could reduce the market value of the Company s common stock. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant
deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses
or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a
timely manner. 

25 

We
are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions.

the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Overview 

We
are dedicated to developing and commercializing proprietary antimicrobial products that address health and environmental challenges related
to pathogen and hygienic control. Our technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver, and our initial products contain
Silver Dihydrogen Citrate, or SDC. This broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent is available in liquid form and various concentrations,
distinguished by its superior efficacy, reduced toxicity, non-causticity, and the inability of bacteria to develop resistance. 

Our
SDC-based disinfecting and sanitizing products are registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, the United
States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and Health Canada. In addition to manufacturing and distributing these products, we also
supply SDC-based formulations as raw material ingredients for personal care products. 

We
see significant market opportunities for our safe and effective SDC-based solutions, particularly in the food industry. Our registered
offerings include PURE Hard Surface, a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant designed for restaurant chains, food processors,
and transportation companies, as well as PURE Control , a direct food contact processing aid. Our products are sold directly to end-use
customers, as well as third-party distributors who market and sell our products across various industries, maximizing our reach and impact. 

Financial
Overview 

This
financial overview provides a general description of our revenue and expenses. 

Net
Product Sales 

We
contract manufacture and sell SDC-based products for end use, and as a raw material for manufacturing use. We recognize revenue when
we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to our customers, in an amount that reflects
the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Any amounts received prior to satisfying revenue
recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition . 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold for product sales includes direct and indirect costs to manufacture products, including materials consumed, manufacturing
overhead, shipping costs, salaries, benefits, reserved inventory, and related expenses of operations. Depreciation related to manufacturing
is systematically allocated to inventory produced, and expensed through cost of goods sold at the time inventory is sold. 

28 

Selling,
General and Administrative 

Selling,
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in business development, sales,
finance, accounting, information technology, and executive functions. Other selling, general and administrative costs include product
marketing, advertising, and trade show costs, as well as public relations and investor relations, facility costs, and legal, accounting
and other professional fees. 

Research
and Development 

Our
research and development activities are focused on leveraging our technology platform to develop additional proprietary products and
applications. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs, product registration expenses, and
third-party testing. We expense research and development costs as incurred. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

We
record interest income, interest expense, as well as other non-operating transactions, as other income (expense) in our consolidated
statements of operations. 

Results
of Operations Comparison of the Years Ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 

Fluctuations
in Operating Results 

Our
results of operations have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future.
We anticipate that our results of operations will be affected for the foreseeable future by several factors that may contribute to these
periodic fluctuations, including fluctuations in the buying patterns of our current or potential customers for which we have no visibility,
the mix of product sales including a change in the percentage of higher or lower margin formulations and packaging configurations of
our products, the cost of product sales including component costs, our inability for any reason to be able to meet demand, the achievement
and timing of research and development and regulatory milestones, unforeseen changes in expenses, including non-cash expenses such as
the fair value of equity awards granted, the calculation of which includes several variable assumptions, and unforeseen manufacturing
or supply issues, among other issues. Due to these fluctuations, we believe that the period-to-period comparisons of our operating results
are not a reliable indication of our future performance. As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any trends in these factors
or events or conditions that we believe are reasonably likely to impact our results of operations in the future. 

Net
Product Sales 

Net
product sales were 1,955,000 and 1,871,000 for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 84,000
was attributable to increased sales across our distribution network servicing the food processing industry. Our top three customers accounted
for 678,000 of net product sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. 

For
the year ended July 31, 2024, one customer accounted for 20 of our net product sales. No other individual customer accounted for 10 
or more of our net product sales. There were no foreign sales during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. 

For
the year ended July 31, 2023, one customer accounted for 24 of our net product sales. No other individual customer accounted for 10 
or more of our net product sales. There were no foreign sales during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. 

During
the fiscal years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 8,000 and 6,000 in royalties from a non-exclusive third-party distributor,
respectively. 

29 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold was 811,000 and 906,000 for the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 95,000 was attributable
to the sale of higher margin products during the current fiscal year. 

Gross
margin, as a percentage of net product sales, was 59 and 52 for the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase
in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the sale of higher margin formulations and packaging configurations of our products
during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 as compared with the current year. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expense 

Selling,
general and administrative expense was 3,981,000 and 4,302,000 for the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
decrease of 321,000 was primarily attributable to decreased personnel, facility and board fees. These decreases were offset by increased
marketing and travel fees. 

Share-based
compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expense, was 214,000 and 324,000 for the fiscal years ended July
31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 110,000 is due to the prior year vesting of stock options and restricted stock units
granted to employees, directors and consultants supporting our selling, general and administrative functions. 

Research
and Development Expense 

Research
and development expense, primarily consisting of third-party fees and personnel costs, was 302,000 and 297,000 for the years ended
July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The slight decrease was primarily attributable to decreased third-party testing and research supporting
our EPA and FDA efforts. 

Impairment
of fixed assets 

During
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, management performed its annual impairment test and determined that its forecasted operations could
no longer support 60,000 of computer software previously capitalized as fixed assets, and as such an impairment was recognized. 

During
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, management performed its annual impairment test and determined that its forecasted operations could
no longer support 237,000 of manufacturing equipment previously capitalized as fixed assets, and as such an impairment was recognized.
In addition, we wrote down 78,000 of construction in progress due to the termination of the Company s lease at its primary facility
in Rancho Cucamonga, California. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense was 155,000 and 14,000 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 141,000 was primarily
due to accrued interest on the outstanding convertible notes. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of July 31, 2024, we had 424,000 in cash and cash equivalents compared with 1,170,000 in cash and cash equivalents as of July 31, 2023.
 The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was attributable to the use of cash to fund our operations.
 Additionally, as of July 31, 2024, we had 3,682,000 of total liabilities, including 601,000 in accounts payable, compared with
 1,553,000 of total liabilities, including 422,000 in accounts payable as of July 31, 2023. The
net increase in total liabilities was due to the multiple note payable financings, summarized below, that occurred during the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2024 and 2023. 

30 

We
have a history of recurring losses, and as of July 31, 2024 we have a stockholders deficiency of 2,864,000. During the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2024, we recorded a net loss of 3,350,000 on recorded net revenue of 1,963,000. In addition, during the year ended July 31,
2024 we used 2,531,000 in operating activities resulting in a cash balance of 349,000 as of July 31, 2024. Our history of recurring
operating losses, and negative cash flows from operating activities give rise to substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from our possible inability to continue
as a going concern.

under the 2023 Note Documents. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

We
believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to aid you in understanding and evaluating our reported financial
results. 

31 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
recognize revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification or ASC, Topic
606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers or Topic 606. Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration
to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. This principle is applied using the following
5-step process: 

1. 
 Identify
 the contract with the customer 

2. 
 Identify
 the performance obligations in the contract 

3. 
 Determine
 the transaction price 

4. 
 Allocate
 the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

5. 
 Recognize
 revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied 

Under
Topic 606, we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to
our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. 

Our
technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver, and our initial products contain SDC.
SDC is a broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent, which offers residual protection and formulates well with other compounds. We
sell various configurations and dilutions of SDC direct to customers and through distributors. We currently offer PURE 
Hard Surface as a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant to restaurant chains, food processors and food transportation companies.
We also offer PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid. 

Contract
terms for unit price, quantity, shipping and payment are governed by sales agreements and purchase orders which we consider to be a customer s
contract in all cases. The unit price is considered the observable stand-alone selling price for the arrangements. Any promotional or
sales discounts are applied evenly to the units sold for purposes of calculating standalone selling price. 

Product
sales generally consist of a single performance obligation that we satisfy at a point in time. We recognize product revenue once the
following events have occurred: (a) we have transferred physical possession of the products, (b) we have a present right to payment,
(c) the customer has legal title to the products, and (d) the customer bears significant risks and rewards of ownership of the
products. 

32 

Our
direct customer and distributor sales are invoiced based on received purchase orders. Our payment terms on invoiced direct customer and
distributor sales range between 30 and 90 days after we satisfy our performance obligation. The majority of our customers are on 30-day
payment terms. We currently offer no right of return on invoiced sales and maintain no allowance for sales returns. 

Shipping
and handling are treated as activities to fulfill promises to customers and any amounts billed to a customer, if applicable, represent
revenues earned for the goods provided. Costs related to such shipping and handling billings are classified as cost of sales. 

We
do not have significant categories of revenue that may impact how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
are affected by economic factors. 

Variable
Consideration 

We
record revenue from customers in an amount that reflects the transaction price we expect to be entitled to after transferring control
of those goods or services. From time to time, we offer sales promotions on our products such as discounts. Variable consideration is
estimated at contract inception only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. 

Share-Based
Compensation 

We
grant equity-based awards under share-based compensation plans. We estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model. This fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards. The Black-Scholes option
valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including price volatility of the underlying stock, risk-free interest
rate, dividend yield, and expected life of the option. Share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest,
and therefore is reduced by expected forfeitures. Changes in assumptions used under the Black-Scholes option valuation model could materially
affect our net loss and net loss per share. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

In
accordance with GAAP, if indicators of impairment exist, we assess the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by determining
whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows. If impairment is indicated,
we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the asset and we record the
impairment as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results. Estimating the undiscounted future
cash flows associated with long-lived assets requires judgment, and assumptions could differ materially from actual results. During the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, management impaired 60,000 of computer software previously capitalized as fixed assets. 

 As
of July 31, 2023, management performed its annual impairment test and determined that its forecasted operations could no longer support
 237,000 of manufacturing equipment previously capitalized as fixed assets, and as such an impairment was recognized. In addition, we
wrote down 78,000 of construction in progress due to the termination of the Company s lease at its primary facility in Rancho
Cucamonga, California. 

For
purposes of testing impairment, we group our long-lived assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent
of other asset groups. Currently, there is only one level of aggregation for our intangible assets. We assess the impairment of long-lived
assets, consisting of property, plant, equipment and finite-lived intangible assets primarily consisting of the worldwide patent portfolio
of our silver ion technologies, annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Examples of such events or circumstances include: 

an
 asset group s inability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; 

loss
 of legal ownership or title to an asset; 

significant
 changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and 

the
 impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. 

Additionally,
on a quarterly basis we review the significant assumptions underlying our impairment assessment to determine that our previous conclusions
remain valid. As part of our review, we consider changes in revenue growth rates, operating margins, working capital needs and other
expenditures. With the exception of the impairment discussed above we have not identified any asset groups where undiscounted cash flows
were not substantially in excess of carrying value. 

Recoverability
of assets to be held and used in operations is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows
expected to be generated by the assets. The factors used to evaluate the future net cash flows, while reasonable, require a high degree
of judgment and the results could vary if the actual results are materially different than the forecasts. In addition, we base useful
lives and amortization or depreciation expense on our subjective estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue or otherwise
be used by us. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
or fair value less selling costs. 

We
also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated
periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies. If a change were to occur in any of the above-mentioned factors
or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase.

required by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, our management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Our Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). With the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control
- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation
under this framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2024. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or
our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design
of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Corporate
Governance 

Overview 

We
are committed to maintaining high standards of business conduct and corporate governance, which we believe are fundamental to the
overall success of our business, serving our stockholders well and maintaining our integrity in the marketplace. Our Corporate
Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (defined below), together with our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and the
charters of our Board Committees (defined below), form the basis for our corporate governance framework. As discussed below, our Board has
established two standing committees to assist it in fulfilling its responsibilities to the Company and its stockholders: the Audit
Committee and the Compensation Committee, or the Board Committees. The Board performs the functions typically assigned to a Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee. 

Corporate
Governance Guidelines 

Our
Corporate Governance Guidelines are designed to ensure effective corporate governance of our Company. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines
cover topics including, but not limited to, director qualification criteria, director responsibilities, director compensation, director
orientation and continuing education, communications from stockholders to the Board, succession planning and the annual evaluations of
the Board and the Board Committees. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are reviewed regularly by the Board and revised when appropriate. The
full text of our Corporate Governance Guidelines can be found in the Corporate Governance section of our website accessible
at www.purebio.com . A printed copy may also be obtained by any stockholder upon request to our Corporate Secretary. 

Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics 

We
have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors. This Code constitutes
a code of ethics as defined by the rules of the SEC. This Code also contains whistle blower procedures adopted
by our Audit Committee regarding the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints related to accounting, internal accounting controls
or auditing matters and procedures for confidential anonymous employee complaints related to questionable accounting or auditing matters.
Copies of the code may be obtained free of charge from our website, www.purebio.com . Any amendments to, or waivers from, a provision
of our code of ethics that applies to any of our executive officers will be posted on our website in accordance with the rules of the
SEC. Other than as specifically referenced herein, the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not
a part of this Report. 

37 

Director
Independence 

We
are not currently listed on any national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has established a standard
for independence. However, in evaluating the independence of our members and the composition of the Board Committees, our Board utilizes the definition of independence as that term is defined by applicable listing standards
of the NYSE MKT. As of the date hereof, our Board consists of seven members, four of whom are considered independent as that term is
defined by applicable listing standards of the NYSE MKT. Our independent directors include: Messrs. Chen, Blotner, Rendall and
Zehr. 

Board
and Board Committee Attendance 

During
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, the Board met six times and it took action by unanimous written consent three times. During the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, our Audit Committee met four times. Four of the directors attended 100 of the meetings of the Board,
one director attended 90 and one director attended 70 . 

Director
Attendance at Annual Meeting 

We
believe the annual meeting of stockholders provides a good opportunity for our directors to hear any feedback the stockholders may share
with the Company at the meeting. As a result, we encourage our directors to attend our annual meeting. We reimburse our directors for
the reasonable expenses incurred by them in attending the annual meeting. 

Executive
Sessions 

Executive
sessions of our independent directors are held at each regularly scheduled meeting of our Board and at other times as necessary and are
chaired by the Chairman of the Board. The Board s policy is to hold executive sessions without the presence of management, including
our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is the only non-independent director on the Board. Our Board Committees also generally
meet in executive session at the end of each Committee meeting. 

Board
Committees 

Compensation
Committee . The Compensation Committee currently consists of Messrs. Chen (Chair), Blotner, Rendall and Zehr. The functions of
the Compensation Committee include the approval of the compensation offered to our executive officers and recommending to the full
Board the compensation to be offered to our directors, including our Chairman. The Board has determined that Messrs. Chen, Blotner,
Rendall and Zehr are each an independent director under the listing standards of the NYSE MKT. In addition, the
members of the Compensation Committee each qualify as a non-employee director for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act and as an outside director for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The Compensation Committee is governed by a written charter approved by the Board, a copy of which is available on our
website at www.purebio.com . 

Audit
Committee . The Audit Committee currently consists of Messrs. Chen (Chair), Blotner, Rendall and Zehr. The functions
of the Audit Committee include the retention of our independent registered public accounting firm, reviewing and approving the planned
scope, proposed fee arrangements and results of the Company s annual audit, reviewing the adequacy of the Company s accounting
and financial controls and reviewing the independence of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. The Board
has determined that Messrs. Chen, Blotner, Rendall and Zehr are each an independent director under the listing standards
of the NYSE MKT. The Board has also determined that Messrs. Chen, Blotner and Rendall are each an audit committee financial expert 
within the applicable definition of the SEC. The Audit Committee is governed by a written charter approved by the Board, a copy of which
is available on our website at www.purebio.com . 

Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee . The Board has not established a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and as a
result performs the functions typically assigned to a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee,
including the following roles: identification, recruitment and nomination of candidates for the Board and the Board Committees,
determining the structure, composition and functioning of the Board and its committees including the reporting channels through
which the Board receives information and the quality and timeliness of the information; developing and recommending to the Board
corporate governance guidelines applicable to the Company and annually reviewing and recommending changes, as necessary or
appropriate; and overseeing the annual evaluation of the Board s effectiveness and performance. 

38 

Board
and Board Committee Effectiveness 

The
Board and each of the Boards Committees performs an annual self-assessment to evaluate their effectiveness in fulfilling their
obligations. The Board s and each Board Committee s evaluations cover a wide range of topics, including, among others, the
fulfillment of the Board, Board Committees, responsibilities identified in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and charters for each
Board Committee. 

Board
Leadership Structure 

Our
Bylaws provide our Board with flexibility to combine or separate the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer in
accordance with its determination that utilizing one or the other structure would be in the best interests of our company. At the current
time, Mr. Chen serves as our Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Bartlett serves as our Chief Executive Officer. Our Board believes our leadership
structure enhances the accountability of our Chief Executive Officer to the Board and encourages balanced decision making. In addition,
the Board believes that this structure provides an environment in which its independent directors are fully informed, have significant
input into the content of Board meetings and are able to provide objective and thoughtful oversight of management. Our Board also separated
the roles in recognition of the differences in responsibilities. While our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day
leadership of the Company and its business operations, the Chairman of the Board provides guidance to the Board, sets the agenda for
Board meetings and presides over the meetings of the full Board and the meetings of the Board s non-management directors. The Board
Chairman also provides performance feedback on behalf of the Board to our Chief Executive Officer. The Board intends to carefully evaluate
from time to time whether our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman positions should remain separate based on what the Board believes
is best for the Company and its stockholders. 

Board
Oversight of Risk 

The
Board is actively involved in the oversight of risks that could affect the Company. The Board as a whole has responsibility for risk
oversight of the Company s risk management policies and procedures, with reviews of certain areas being conducted by the relevant
Board committee. The Board satisfies this responsibility through reports by each Committee Chair regarding the Committee s considerations
and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from management responsible for oversight of particular risks within the Company.
Specifically, the Board committees address the following risk areas: 

The
 Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks related to the Company s executive compensation
 plans and arrangements. 

The
 Audit Committee discusses with management the Company s major financial and other risk exposures , including cybersecutiry,
 and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. 

The
Board as a whole considers risks related to regulatory and compliance matters as well as risks related to the Company s sales and
marketing and research and development initiatives. 

The
Board encourages management to promote a corporate culture that incorporates risk management into the Company s day-to-day business
operations. 

Stockholder
Recommendations for Director Nominees 

In
nominating candidates for election as a director, the Board will consider a reasonable number of candidates recommended by a single stockholder
who has held over 20 of PURE Bioscience, Inc. common stock for over one year and who satisfies the notice, information and consent provisions
set forth in our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines. Stockholders who wish to recommend a candidate may do so by writing to the
Board in care of the Corporate Secretary, PURE Bioscience, Inc., 771 Jamacha Road, #512, El Cajon, California 92019. The Board will use
the same evaluation process for director nominees recommended by stockholders as it uses for other director nominees. A printed copy
of our Bylaws may be obtained by any stockholder upon request to our Corporate Secretary. 

39 

Identification
and Evaluation of Director Nominees 

In
evaluating nominees for membership on our Board, our Board applies the Board membership criteria set forth in our Corporate Governance
Guidelines. Under these criteria, the Board takes into account many factors, including an individual s business experience and
skills (including skills in core areas such as operations, management, technology, accounting and finance, strategic planning and international
markets), as well as independence, judgment, knowledge of our business and industry, professional reputation, leadership, integrity and
ability to represent the best interests of the Company s stockholders. In addition, the Board also considers the ability to commit
sufficient time and attention to the activities of the Board, as well as the absence of any potential conflicts with the Company s
interests. The Board does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to
all prospective nominees. The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity of nominees. Rather, our Board considers
Board membership criteria as a whole and seeks to achieve diversity of occupational and personal backgrounds on the Board. 

Our
Board regularly assesses the appropriate size of our Board, and whether any vacancies on our Board are expected due to retirement or
otherwise. In the event that vacancies are anticipated, or otherwise arise, the Board will consider various potential candidates who
may come to the attention of the Board through current Board members, professional search firms, stockholders or other persons. Each
candidate brought to the attention of the Board, regardless of who recommended such candidate, is considered on the basis of the criteria
set forth in our corporate governance guidelines. As stated above, our Board will consider candidates proposed for nomination by our
significant stockholders. Stockholders may propose candidates by submitting the names and supporting information to: Corporate Secretary,
PURE Bioscience, Inc., 771 Jamacha Road, #512, El Cajon, California 92019. Supporting information should include (a) the name and address
of the candidate and the proposing stockholder, (b) a comprehensive biography of the candidate and an explanation of why the candidate
is qualified to serve as a director taking into account the criteria identified in our corporate governance guidelines, (c) proof of
ownership, the class and number of shares, and the length of time that the shares of our voting securities have been beneficially owned
by each of the candidate and the proposing stockholder, and (d) a letter signed by the candidate stating his or her willingness to serve,
if elected. 

Insider Trading Arrangements and Policies 

We have adopted insider trading policies and procedures
governing the purchase, sale, and/or other dispositions of the Company s securities by directors, officers and employees, or the
Company itself, that are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, and any listing standards
applicable to the Company. A copy of the Company s insider trading policy has been filed as Exhibit 19.1 to this Annual Report. 

We have not adopted an insider trading policy governing the purchase,
sale, and other dispositions of our securities by directors, senior management, and employees, but plan to do so in the future. However,
the Board and management are cognizant of the need to promote compliance with applicable securities laws, known as insider trading 
laws, which prohibit persons who receive or become aware of material non-public information about the Company (or other companies that
do business with the Company) from trading in the Company s (or such other company s) securities or providing material non-public
information to others who may trade in the Company s (or such other company s) securities on the basis of that information.

paid by companies in our industry for similar positions, our financial position and performance, and the strength of our business. Base
salaries provide a fixed means of compensation in order to attract and retain talent. Mr. Lee received no base salary as Chief Executive
Officer prior to his resignation in March 2023. The base salary for Mr. Bartlett was voluntary reduced from 300,000 per year to 200,000
per year during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 the base salaries for Messrs. Bartlett,
Elliott and Myers was 200,000, 180,000 and 200,000, respectively. 

Performance-Based
Cash Awards : As part of the Company s executive compensation program, our executive officers are eligible to receive performance-based
cash awards. The annual performance-based cash awards are based on the executive officer s individual performance and the Company s
actual performance compared to the corporate goals approved by the Board and the Compensation Committee. Following the end of each fiscal
year, the Board and the Compensation Committee is responsible for determining the bonus amount payable to an executive officer based
on that executive officer s individual performance during the fiscal year and its determination of the Company s actual performance
compared to the corporate goals established for that fiscal year. Due to the Company s limited financial resources and performance,
our named executive officers did not receive any performance-based cash bonuses for the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Long-Term
Equity Awards : Equity ownership by our executive officers and key employees encourages them to create long-term value and aligns
their interests with those of our stockholders. As a result, our executive compensation program provides for the issuance of stock options
and RSUs as determined by the Compensation Committee and our Board.

Pay-Versus-Performance 

As
required by Section 952(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are
providing the following information about the relationship between executive compensation actually paid, or CAP, and our financial performance
for each of the last two completed fiscal years. In determining the CAP to our named executive officers
(or NEOs ), we are required to make various adjustments to amounts that have been previously reported in the Summary Compensation
Table in previous years, as the SEC s valuation methods for this disclosure differ from those required in the Summary Compensation
Table. For our NEOs, other than our principal executive officer (the PEO ), compensation is reported as an average.

Code
Section 162(m) Provisions 

Section
162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or the IRS Code, generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation
in excess of 1 million paid to the Chief Executive Officer or any of the four most highly compensated officers. Prior to changes in
tax law taking effect in 2018, there was an exception to the 1.0 million limitation for performance-based compensation, including
stock options, meeting certain requirements. Before such amendments we had not adopted a policy that all compensation must qualify
as deductible under Section 162(m) of the IRS Code. The exemption from the Section 162(m) deduction limit for performance-based
compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our
Chief Executive Officer and certain other executive officers in excess of 1.0 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies
for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017.

Narrative
to Director Compensation Table 

Each
non-employee director of the Company receives cash fees from the Company for their services as members of the Board, and any Board
Committees, as follows: 

Each
 non-employee director receives an annual fee of 30,000 payable for such director s service on the Board and each member of
 the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee receives an additional annual fee of 2,000 and 2,000, respectively, payable for
 such director s service on that Board Committee. 

The
 Chair of the Audit Committee receives an additional annual fee of 5,000 for such Chair s service and the Chair of the Compensation
 Committee receives an additional annual fee of 2,500 for such Chair s service. 

Annual
fees are normally paid to each non-employee director in four equal installments on a quarterly basis. Any non-employee directors serving
a portion of the year are entitled to receive such fees on a pro rata basis based on their length of service during the year. Mr. Myers
and Mr. Bartlett did not receive any additional compensation for their board service. 

Additionally,
new members of the Board are entitled to receive stock options in an amount to be determined by the Compensation Committee or the Board. 

During
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, Messrs. Chen, Lee, Rendall and Blotner received options to purchase 150,000, 125,000, 125,000 and
125,000 shares of common stock, respectively. The options vest fifty percent (50 on the date of the next annual meeting and fifty percent
(50 on the date of the following year s annual meeting. Mr. Zehr did not receive any equity awards during the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2024. 

In
the past, our Board has approved each year, generally in the first or second calendar quarter of the year, an annual option or stock
grant for our non-employee directors. Any such grant is at the discretion of the Board, which considers the recommendation of our Compensation
Committee. Upon the Board s approval of any such grant, each non-employee director generally may elect whether to receive the grant
as an option or stock award. 

Item
12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 

The
following table provides information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of October 29, 2024, or the Evaluation
Date, by: (i) each of our current directors, (ii) each of our named executive officers as set forth in Item 11 of this Annual Report,
(iii) all such directors and executive officers as a group and (iv) our five percent or greater stockholders. The table is based upon
information supplied by our officers, directors and principal stockholders and a review of Schedules 13D and 13G, if any, filed with
the SEC. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the table and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe
that each of the stockholders named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially
owned. 

Applicable
percentages are based on 117,381,473 shares outstanding as of the Evaluation Date, adjusted as required by rules promulgated by the SEC.
These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power
with respect to those securities. In addition, the rules include shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock
options or warrants or settlement of restricted stock units that are either immediately exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of
the Evaluation Date. These shares are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding those securities for the
purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person, but they are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the
percentage ownership of any other person.

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section

own more than 10 of our Common Stock to file initial reports of beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership
with the SEC. Such persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such persons. 

To
the Company s knowledge, no person who, during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, was a director or officer of the Company, or
beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the Company s Common Stock (which is the only class of securities of the Company registered
under Section 12 of the Act), failed to file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16 of the Act during such fiscal year. 

Information
About Our Equity Compensation Plans 

2024
Equity Incentive Plan 

Our
shareholders approved our 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2024 Plan, in February 2024, which has a share reserve of 10,000,000 shares
of common stock that were registered under a Form S-8 filed with the SEC in August 2024. The 2024 Plan provides for the grant of incentive
and non-qualified stock options, as well as other share-based payment awards, to our employees, directors, consultants and advisors.
These awards have up to a 10-year contractual life and are subject to various vesting periods, as determined by the Compensation Committee
of the Board. The 2024 Plan replaced the prior amended and restated 2007 and 2017 shareholder approved equity plans. As of July 31, 2024,
there were 10,000,000 shares available for issuance under the 2024 Plan. 

All
of our equity incentive plans are administered by the Compensation Committee. The exercise price for stock options is always at or above
the fair market value of our common stock on the date the award is granted. Fair market value is defined by the Plan and is based on
prevailing market prices of our common stock as reported by the OTCQB. The term of stock options granted and their vesting schedules
are determined by the Compensation Committee, subject to any limitations defined in the Plan. The Compensation Committee also determines
the vesting of other, non-option, stock awards.

On
June 23, 2017 we filed a Form S-8 to register shares of common stock underlying equity awards granted to our directors and officers outside
the 2007 Plan. The S-8 registered 3,150,000 shares with respect to RSUs and options, which were also granted on the same date. 

On
August 23, 2017 we filed a Form S-8 to register shares of common stock underlying equity awards granted to our directors, officers and
consultants outside the 2007 Plan. The S-8 registered 850,000 shares with respect to RSUs and options, which were also granted on the
same date.

On
July 29, 2019, we entered into the Sublease with SwabPlus, effective July 25, 2019, pursuant to which we subleased certain office and
industrial space for our corporate headquarters. The premises are located in Rancho Cucamonga, California. In December 2020, the Sublease
expired but we continued to rent on a month-to-month basis. Subsequent to July 31, 2023, our month-to month lease at the Rancho Cucamonga
premises was terminated and we now operate completely remote. 

Tom
Y. Lee, our former Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and President, serves as chairman of the board of directors and chief
executive officer of SwabPlus. Mr. Lee also serves as president of Hermosa Property, Inc., the landlord of the premises subject to the
Sublease. The Sublease was considered by the Company in accordance with the Company s Related Party Transaction and Procedures
Policy, and approved by the disinterested members of the Board.

Audit Committee or our independent directors. Any request for us to enter into a transaction with an executive officer, director, principal
stockholder, or any of such persons immediate family members or affiliates, must first be presented to our Audit Committee for

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Stockholders and Board of Directors 

 Pure
Bioscience Inc. 

 El
Cajon, Ca. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pure Bioscience Inc. (the Company and Subsidiaries as of
July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficiency), and cash flows for the years
then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows
from operating activities, and has a stockholders deficiency at July 31, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note
1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to
the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit
matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which
they relate. 

Issuance
of convertible notes payable to related parties 

As
described in Note 5 to the financial statements, as of July 31, 2024, the Company issued certain convertible debentures in an aggregate
amount of 2.8 million to related parties, The agreements contained provisions and terms that required the Company to analyze and determine
if there were elements of the notes or its conversion feature that would result in (i) a derivative under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging,
(ii) as liabilities in accordance with ASC 480, (iii) or as a standard note agreement. We identified auditing of the accounting for the
convertible notes as a critical audit matter due to the complexity of the accounting of these liabilities, and because of the significance
of the account balances, 

The
primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit included, among others, inspection of the debt agreement and testing management s
application of the relevant accounting guidance, including the determination of the balance sheet classification. This included examining
and testing the Company s conclusions if the notes or its conversion feature resulted in a derivative under ASC 815, Derivatives
and Hedging, or as liabilities in accordance with ASC 480. We developed our independent expectation of the recording and presentation
of the liabilities and compared our independent expectation to the Company presentation. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2019.

 Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements 

. During the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2024, it recorded a net loss of on recorded net revenue of . In addition, during the year ended July 31,
2024 the Company used in operating activities resulting in a cash balance of as of July 31, 2024. The Company s history of recurring
operating losses, and negative cash flows from operating activities give rise to substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from our possible inability to continue
as a going concern. 

The Company s
future capital requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
the acceptance of, and demand for, its products; the Company s success and the success of its partners in selling our products; the Company s success and
the success of its partners in obtaining regulatory approvals to sell its products; the costs of further developing the Company s existing products
and technologies; the extent to which the Company invests in new product and technology development; and the costs associated with the continued
operation, and any future growth, of its business. The outcome of these and other forward-looking factors will substantially affect its
liquidity and capital resources. 

Until
the Company can continually generate positive cash flow from operations,
it will need to continue to fund its operations with the proceeds of offerings of our equity and debt securities. However, the Company
cannot ensure that additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable
to the Company or to its stockholders. If the Company raises additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution
to its existing stockholders would likely result. If the Company raises additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the
debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict its ability
to operate its business.

Variable
Consideration 

The Company records revenue from customers in an amount that reflects the
transaction price it expects to be entitled to after transferring control of those goods or services. From time to time, the Company offer
sales promotions on its products such as discounts. Variable consideration is estimated at contract inception only to the extent that
it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.

segment for the manufacture and distribution of our products. In accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic
of the ASC, its chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating
results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based
on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report
annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets
and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under Segment Reporting due to their similar
customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution
processes. Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial information required by Segment Reporting can be found
in the accompanying financial statements. 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure, or ASC 280,
which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment
expense categories that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included in each reported measure of a segment s
profit or loss. The update also requires all annual disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets to be provided
in interim periods and for entities with a single reportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by ASC 280, including the
significant segment expense disclosures. This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2025, with early adoption
permitted. The updates required by this standard should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements.
The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s
present or future financial statements.

At

The Company
uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options. Share-based compensation expense is recognized over

weighted average assumptions: 

Risk-free interest rate 

Dividend yield 

Expected life

 years 

Volatility
is the measure by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of an option. Volatility is derived from the
historical daily change in the market price of our common stock, as we believe that historical volatility is the best indicator of future
volatility. 

The
risk-free interest rates used in the Black-Scholes calculations are based on the prevailing U.S. Treasury yield as determined by the
U.S. Federal Reserve. 

The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate
paying dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, it has assumed no dividend yield for purposes of estimating
the fair value of its share-based compensation. 

The
weighted average expected life of options was estimated using the average of the contractual term and the weighted average vesting term
of the options.

income tax provision for the years ended
July 31, 2024 and 2023 due to the net losses. 

At
July 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state tax net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately 
million and 
million, respectively. Utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to
ownership change limitations that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss carry-forwards
that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in
an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public
groups. Since its formation, the Company has raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions (both before
and after its initial public offering in 1996) which, combined with the purchasing stockholders subsequent disposition of
those shares, may have resulted in such an ownership change, or could result in an ownership change in the future upon subsequent
disposition. While the Company does not believe that it has experienced an ownership change, the pertinent tax rules related thereto are
complex and subject to varying interpretations, and thus complete assurance cannot be provided that the taxing authorities would not
take an alternative position. 

The Company s
current federal tax loss carry-forwards began expiring in the year ended July 31, 2020 and, unless previously utilized, all but 
million will completely expire in the year ending . The million can be carried forward indefinitely.

Following
authoritative guidance, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from a tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. 

The
Company s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense; however it
has had 
accrued interest or penalties at either July 31, 2024 or July 31, 2023. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States
and in various states, and its historical tax years remain subject to future examination by the U.S. and state tax authorities.
During the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, it did t
record any activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits. 

The
Company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions. With few exceptions,
the Company is no longer subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in major jurisdictions for tax years prior to 2012. However,
to the extent allowed by law, the taxing authorities may have the right to examine prior periods where net operating losses were generated
and carried forward, and make adjustments up to the amount of the carryforwards. The Company is not currently under examination by the
IRS or state taxing authorities.

DESCRIPTION
OF CAPITAL STOCK 

General 

Pure
Bioscience, Inc. we, us, and our has one class of securities registered under Section 12
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended - our common stock, 0.01 par value per share. 

The
following information describes our capital stock, as well as certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The
summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws,
copies of which have been filed as exhibits to our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Our
authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a 0.01 par value
per share, all of which shares of preferred stock are undesignated. Our board of directors may establish the rights and preferences of
the preferred stock from time to time. As of October 29, 2024, there were 111,856,473 shares of common stock issued and outstanding,
held of record by 219 stockholders, although we believe that there may be a significantly larger number of beneficial owners of our common
stock. We derived the number of stockholders by reviewing the listing of outstanding common stock recorded by our transfer agent as of
October 29, 2024. 

Common
Stock 

The
holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders. The holders of common
stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors out of funds
legally available, subject to preferences that may be applicable to preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of our company, the holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment
of liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. The common stock has no preemptive
or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.
All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. 

The
rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of
the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future. 

Our
common stock is approved for quotation on the OTCQB under the symbol PURE. The transfer
agent and registrar for the common stock is Transfer Online, Inc. Its address is 512 SE Salmon St. Portland, OR 97214, and its telephone
number is (503) 227-2950. 

Preferred
Stock 

Pursuant
to our Certificate of Incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders (unless such
stockholder action is required by applicable law), to designate and issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series,
to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, to fix the designations, powers, preferences
and rights of the shares of each wholly unissued series, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, and to increase
or decrease the number of shares of any such series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. 

Our
Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting
power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. Preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms designed to delay or prevent
a change in control of the Company or make removal of management more difficult. Additionally, the issuance of preferred stock may have
the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock. 

Anti-takeover
effects of provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Delaware law 

Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws 

Because
our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, stockholders holding a majority of the shares of
common stock represented in person or by proxy at a duly called stockholder meeting will be able to elect all of our directors. Our Board
of Directors will be able to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board or due to the resignation, death
or departure of an existing member of the Board. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws also provide that all stockholder actions
must be effected at a duly called meeting of stockholders and not by a consent in writing, and that only the Board of Directors, Chairman
of the Board or Chief Executive Officer may call a special meeting of stockholders. In addition, our Bylaws include a requirement for
the advance notice of nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders 
meeting. As described above, our Certificate of Incorporation also provides for the ability of the Board of Directors to issue, without
stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with terms set by the Board of Directors, which rights could be senior
to those of our common stock and which terms could be designed to delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or make removal
of management more difficult. 

The
foregoing provisions may make it difficult for our existing stockholders to replace our Board of Directors, as well as for another party
to obtain control of the Company by replacing our Board of Directors. In addition, the authorization of undesignated preferred stock
makes it possible for the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the
success of any attempt to change the Company s control. Further, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that we will
indemnify our directors and officers against liabilities, losses and expenses incurred or suffered in investigations and legal proceedings
resulting from their services for us, which may include service in connection with takeover defense measures. 

Delaware
Anti-Takeover Statute 

We
are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. Under
Section 203 of the DGCL, a Delaware corporation is prohibited from engaging in a business combination with an interested
stockholder for three years following the date that such person or entity becomes an interested stockholder. With certain exceptions,
an interested stockholder is a person or entity that owns, individually or with or through other persons or entities, fifteen percent
(15 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock (including rights to acquire stock pursuant to an option, warrant,
agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion or exchange rights, and also stock as to which the person
has voting rights only). The three-year moratorium imposed by Section 203 on business combinations does not apply if: 

Prior
 to the date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approves
 either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the person or entity becoming an interested stockholder; 

Upon
 consummation of the transaction that makes the person or entity an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owns at least
 eighty-five percent (85 of the corporation s voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding, for
 purposes of determining voting stock outstanding, shares owned by directors who are also officers of the corporation and shares held
 by employee stock plans that do not give employee participants the right to decide confidentially whether to accept a tender or exchange
 offer); or 

On
 or after the date the person or entity becomes an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved both by the board
 of directors and by the stockholders at a meeting by sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3 of the outstanding voting stock
 not owned by the interested stockholder. 

In
general, Section 203 defines business combination to include the following: 

any
 merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder; 

any
 sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10 or more of either the assets or outstanding stock of
 the corporation involving the interested stockholder; 

subject
 to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation
 to the interested stockholder; 

any
 transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series
 of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or 

the
 receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits by or
 through the corporation. 

In
general, Section 203 defines interested stockholder as an entity or person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially
owns, or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15 or more of the outstanding voting
stock of the corporation. 

A
Delaware corporation may opt out of these provisions with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation
or an express provision in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from a stockholders amendment approved by at least
a majority of the outstanding voting shares. We have not opted out and do not plan to opt out of these provisions.
The statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly, may discourage attempts
to acquire us. 

The
provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting
hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that often
result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management.
It is possible that these provisions may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be
in their best interests.
