PART I 
 ITEM 1. B USINESS 
 General 
 On July 26, 2023, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. announced its new brand and assumed name, Radius Recycling. Subsequently, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation to change the corporate name of the Company from Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. to Radius Recycling, Inc. at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on January 30, 2024 (the Name Change ). That same day, the Company effectuated the Name Change by filing articles of amendment of the Articles of Incorporation with the Oregon Secretary of State and amended and restated its Bylaws to reflect the Name Change. 
 Founded in 1906, Radius Recycling is one of North America s largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products. As a vertically integrated organization, we offer a range of products and services to meet global demand through our network that includes 50 retail self-service auto parts stores, 53 metals recycling facilities, and an electric arc furnace EAF steel mill. Our internal organizational and reporting structure includes a single operating and reportable segment. 
 Worldwide demand for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal is driven primarily by production levels for finished steel and for products using nonferrous metal. Recycled ferrous metal is the primary feedstock for steel mill production using EAF technology and one of the raw materials utilized for steel manufacturing using blast furnace technology. Steel mills around the world, including those in the North American domestic market in which our own steel mill operates, are the primary end markets for our recycled ferrous metal products. Specialty steelmakers, foundries, refineries, smelters, wholesalers, and other recycled metal processors globally are the primary end markets for our recycled nonferrous metal products. Our steel mill produces finished steel products using internally sourced recycled ferrous metal as the primary raw material and sells to customers located primarily in the Western United States and Western Canada. 
 We believe long-term demand for recycled metals will continue to be driven by factors including global economic growth and an increased focus on environmental policies promoting natural resource conservation, decarbonization, and lower energy usage. We believe the significant environmental benefits and production efficiencies associated with steelmaking that maximizes the use of recycled metal as a raw material, compared to iron ore mined from natural resources, will positively contribute to worldwide long-term demand for recycled ferrous metal. Further, we believe decarbonization efforts by companies, industries, and governments around the world, including investments in low carbon technologies such as renewable energies, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency solutions that are more metal intensive and minimize carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels, among other factors, support global long-term demand for recycled nonferrous metal such as aluminum and copper. 
 Revenue-Generating Activities 
 We acquire, process, and recycle end-of-life (salvaged) vehicles, rail cars, home appliances, industrial machinery, manufacturing scrap, and construction and demolition scrap through our facilities. Our retail self-service auto parts stores located across the United States U.S. and Western Canada, which operate under the commercial brand-name Pick-n-Pull, procure the majority of our salvaged vehicles and sell serviceable used auto parts from these vehicles. Upon acquiring a salvaged vehicle, we remove catalytic converters, aluminum wheels, and batteries for separate processing and sale prior to placing the vehicle in our retail lot. After retail customers have removed desired parts from a vehicle, we may remove remaining major component parts containing ferrous and nonferrous metals, which are primarily sold to wholesalers. The remaining auto bodies are crushed and shipped to our metals recycling facilities where geographically practical, or sold to third parties, for shredding. At our metals recycling facilities, we process mixed and large pieces of scrap metal into smaller pieces by crushing, torching, shearing, shredding, separating, and sorting, resulting in recycled ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed metal pieces of a size, density, and metal content required by customers to meet their production needs. Each of our shredding, nonferrous processing, and separation systems is designed to optimize the recovery of valuable recycled metal.

We operate seven deepwater port locations, six of which are equipped with large-scale shredders. Our largest port facilities in Everett, Massachusetts; Portland, Oregon; Oakland, California; and Tacoma, Washington each operate a mega-shredder with 7,000 to 9,000 horsepower. Our port facilities in Salinas, Puerto Rico, and Kapolei, Hawaii operate shredders with 1,500 and 4,000 horsepower, respectively. Our port facility in Providence, Rhode Island does not operate a shredder, but exports recycled ferrous metal acquired in the regional market. In addition, we operate a 2,500-horsepower shredder at our non-port facility in Lithonia, Georgia. Our shredders are designed to provide a denser product and, in conjunction with advanced separation equipment, a more refined form of recycled ferrous metal which can be used efficiently by steel mills in the production of new steel. The shredding process reduces auto bodies and other scrap metal into fist-size pieces of shredded recycled metal. The shredded material is then carried by conveyor under magnetized drums that attract the ferrous metal and separate it from the mixed nonferrous metal and other residue, resulting in a consistent and high-quality shredded ferrous product. The mixed nonferrous metal and residue then pass through a series of additional mechanical systems designed to recover and separate the nonferrous metal from the residue. The remaining mixed nonferrous metal is then further sorted by product and size grade before being sold as joint products, which include mainly zorba (primarily aluminum), zurik (primarily stainless steel), and shredded insulated wire (primarily copper and aluminum). We sell further separated products with higher metal content such as twitch (light gauge recycled aluminum) and shredded copper and brass. We also purchase nonferrous metal directly from industrial vendors and other suppliers and aggregate and prepare this metal for shipment to customers by ship, rail, or truck. 
 We invest in nonferrous metal extraction and separation technologies to optimize the recovery of valuable nonferrous metal and to meet the metal purity requirements of customers. We have a major strategic initiative currently in progress and partially completed to replace, upgrade, and add to our existing nonferrous metal recovery technologies in order to increase metal recovery and the volume of nonferrous material from shredding operations, provide additional product optionality, create higher quality furnace-ready products, and reduce the metallic portion of shredder residue disposed in landfills. Our program comprises seven primary nonferrous recovery systems at our major shredder facilities. Of these systems, three are major aluminum and four are major copper recovery systems. Our initiative also includes two aluminum separation systems, one on each coast, and four copper separation systems. The construction, commissioning, and ramp up of these new technologies, including commencement of permitting approvals, began substantially in fiscal 2021, with 11 of the 13 systems operational or in the ramp-up phase as of the end of fiscal 2024, and two remaining subject to permitting. We anticipate that all currently permitted systems will reach the fully operational stage during fiscal 2025. Total capital expenditures for these projects are estimated to be approximately 140 million, of which approximately 135 million has been incurred, including 5 million during fiscal 2024. 
 In addition to the sale of recycled metal processed at our facilities, we provide a variety of recycling and related services including brokering the sale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal generated by retail and industrial entities and demolition projects to customers in the domestic market, among other services. We also lease machinery assets to customers primarily to facilitate the provision of reverse logistics and other recycling services. Contract consideration for our recycling services is generally less sensitive to changes in market prices for scrap metal compared to sales of recycled metal from our recycling operations. 
 Our steel mill melt shop includes an EAF, a ladle refining furnace with enhanced steel chemistry refining capabilities, and a five-strand continuous billet caster, permitting the mill to produce special alloy grades of steel not currently produced by other mills on the West Coast of the U.S. The substantial majority of billets produced are reheated in a natural gas-fueled furnace and are then hot-rolled through the rolling mill to produce finished steel long products. The rolling mill has an effective annual production capacity under current conditions of approximately 580 thousand tons of finished steel products. 
 Products and Services 
 Recycled ferrous metal is a key feedstock used in the production of finished steel and is largely categorized into heavy melting steel HMS ), plate and structural bonus ), and shredded scrap metal shred ), although there are various grades of each category depending on metal content and the size and consistency of individual pieces. These attributes affect the product s relative value. 
 Our nonferrous products include mixed metal joint products recovered from the shredding process, as well as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, nickel, brass, titanium, lead, and high temperature alloys. We also sell catalytic converters to specialty processors that extract the nonferrous precious metals including platinum, palladium, and rhodium. 
 We provide recycling and related services involving scrap metal and other recyclable materials to a range of customers, including large retailers, industrial manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, and owners of end-of-life railcars. These services include primarily scrap brokerage, certified destruction, automotive parts recycling, railcar dismantling, and reverse logistics. During fiscal 2023, we expanded our recycling services operations through our acquisition of ScrapSource, a recycling services company that provides solutions for industrial companies that generate scrap metal from their manufacturing process. Also in fiscal 2023, we launched our integrated recycling services activities under our trademarked 3PR TM brand which stands for third-party recycling and encompasses all our recycling services offerings.

Each retail self-service auto parts store offers an extensive selection of vehicles (including domestic and foreign cars, vans, and light trucks) from which customers can remove and purchase parts. We employ proprietary information technology systems to centrally manage and operate the geographically diverse network of auto parts stores, and we regularly rotate the inventory to provide customers with greater access to parts. Our used auto parts inventory is also searchable on our Pick-n-Pull public website. We enter into limited duration contracts with public entities and other third parties for vehicle dismantling and asset recovery services, which provide a source of low-cost salvage vehicles. 
 Our steel mill produces semi-finished goods (billets) and finished goods, consisting of rebar, coiled rebar, wire rod, merchant bar, and other specialty products, using recycled ferrous metal sourced internally from our recycling and joint venture operations and other raw materials. Semi-finished goods are predominantly used for the manufacturing of finished products. Rebar is produced in either straight length steel bars or coils and used to increase the strength of poured concrete. Coiled rebar is preferred by some manufacturers because it reduces the waste generated by cutting individual lengths to meet customer specifications and, therefore, improves yield. Wire rod is steel rod, delivered in coiled form, used by manufacturers to produce a variety of products such as chain link fencing, nails, wire, stucco netting, and pre-stressed concrete strand. Merchant bar consists of rounds and square steel bars used by manufacturers to produce a wide variety of products, including bolts, threaded bars, and dowel bars. Our steel mill is also an approved supplier of high-quality rebar to support nuclear power plant construction and has a license to produce certain patented high-strength specialty steels.

Pricing 
 Domestic and foreign prices for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal are generally based on prevailing market rates, which differ by region, and are subject to market cycles that are influenced by worldwide demand from steel and other metal producers, the availability of materials that can be processed into saleable recycled metal, and regulatory policies, among other factors. Sanctions, trade actions, and licensing and inspection requirements can also impact pricing for the affected products. Recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal sales contracts generally provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed to which, in most cases, includes freight. 
 We respond to changes in selling prices for processed metal by seeking to adjust purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal in order to manage the impact on our operating income. The spread between selling prices for processed metal and the cost of purchased scrap metal (metal spread) is subject to a number of factors, including differences in the market conditions between the domestic regions where scrap metal is acquired and the areas in the world to which the processed metals are sold, market volatility from the time the selling price is agreed upon with the customer until the time the scrap metal is purchased, changes in the availability of scrap metal including the volume generated by source and grade, and changes in transportation costs. We generally benefit from sustained periods of stable or rising recycled metal selling prices, which allow us to better maintain or increase both operating income and unprocessed scrap metal flow into our facilities. Conversely, when recycled metal selling prices decline, either sharply or for a sustained period, our operating margins typically compress.

The sales prices for auto parts from salvaged vehicles are deeply discounted from prevailing national new and refurbished sales prices offered at full-service auto dismantlers, retail auto parts stores, and car dealerships. Our stores provide a list price, available at each location and online. Prices for auto bodies sold to third parties and for major component parts, such as engines, transmissions, and alternators sold to wholesalers, are based on prevailing recycled metal market rates which differ by region and are subject to market cycles. Prices for catalytic converters sold to third-party processors are based on prevailing market rates for the extracted precious metals including platinum, palladium, and rhodium. By consolidating shipments of auto bodies and component parts, we are able to optimize prices by focusing on larger wholesale customers that pay a premium for volume and consistency of shipments. 
 Our finished steel product prices differ by product size and grade. Selling prices are influenced by the price of raw materials, including the cost of recycled ferrous metal and required consumables including graphite electrodes and alloys, as well as regional demand in the West Coast and Western Canadian markets. Selling prices for our finished steel products may also be affected by the price and availability of steel imports. 
 Customers and Markets 
 Approximately 94 of our consolidated revenues are derived from sales of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal products and finished steel products. We sell our recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal products globally to steel mills, foundries, refineries, smelters, wholesalers, and other recycled metal processors. Our finished steel customers are primarily steel service centers, construction industry subcontractors, steel fabricators, wire drawers, and major farm and wood products suppliers. We had no external customers that accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2024, 2023, or 2022.

We export recycled ferrous metal primarily to countries in Asia, the Mediterranean region, and the Americas. Ferrous exports made up 54 , 55 , and 61 of our total ferrous volumes in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In fiscal 2024, the three countries from which we derived our largest ferrous export revenues from external customers were Bangladesh, Turkey, and India, which collectively accounted for 85 of our total ferrous export revenues. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the three countries from which we derived our largest ferrous export revenues from external customers accounted for 72 and 71 , respectively, of our total ferrous export revenues. We generally attribute revenues from external customers to individual countries based on the country in which the customer is located. Our three largest external recycled ferrous metal customers accounted for 35 of total ferrous revenues in fiscal 2024, compared to 23 and 22 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 (1) Steel revenues include predominantly sales of finished steel products, in addition to sales of semi-finished goods (billets) and steel manufacturing scrap. 

We sell finished steel products to customers located primarily in the Western United States and Western Canada. Customers in California accounted for 50 , 53 , and 55 of our steel revenues in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 
 Distribution 
 We deliver recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal to foreign customers by ship and to domestic customers by barge, rail, and road transportation networks. Cost efficiencies are achieved by operating deepwater terminal facilities in Everett, Massachusetts; Portland, Oregon; Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Providence, Rhode Island, all of which are owned, except for the Providence, Rhode Island facility which is operated under a long-term lease. We also have access to deepwater terminal facilities at Kapolei, Hawaii and Salinas, Puerto Rico through public docks. The use of deepwater terminals enables us to load ferrous material in large vessels capable of holding up to 50,000 tons for trans-oceanic shipments. We believe the use of our owned and leased terminal facilities is advantageous because it allows us to more effectively manage loading costs and minimize the berthing delays often experienced by users of unaffiliated terminals. From time to time, we may enter into contracts of affreightment, which guarantee the availability of ocean-going vessels, in order to manage the risks associated with ship availability and freight costs. 
 Our nonferrous products are shipped in 20- to 30-ton capacity containers from ports and rail ramps located in close proximity to our recycling facilities. Containerized shipments are exported by marine vessels to customers globally, and domestic shipments are typically shipped to customers by rail or by truck.

We sell used auto parts from our self-service retail stores. Both before and after retail customers have removed desired parts from acquired salvaged vehicles, we extract and consolidate certain valuable ferrous and nonferrous components from auto bodies for shipment by truck primarily to wholesale customers. We also remove and collect catalytic converters from salvaged vehicles for shipment by truck to specialty processors which extract the nonferrous precious metals. The salvaged auto bodies are crushed and shipped by truck to our metals recycling facilities where geographically practical, or to third-party recyclers, for shredding. 
 We sell finished steel products directly from our steel mill in McMinnville, Oregon and our distribution center in City of Industry, California (Los Angeles area). Finished steel products are shipped from the mill to the distribution center primarily by rail. The distribution center facilitates sales by maintaining an inventory of products close to major customers for just-in-time delivery. We communicate regularly with major customers to determine their anticipated needs and plan our rolling mill production schedule accordingly. Finished steel shipments to customers are made by common carrier, primarily truck or rail. 
 Sources of Unprocessed Metal 
 The most common forms of purchased unprocessed metal are obsolete machinery and equipment, such as automobiles, railroad cars, railroad tracks, home appliances and other consumer goods, scrap metal from manufacturing operations and retailers, and demolition metal from buildings and other infrastructure. Unprocessed metal is acquired from a diverse base of suppliers who unload at our facilities, from drop boxes at suppliers industrial sites, and through negotiated purchases from other large suppliers, including railroads, manufacturers, automobile salvage facilities, metal dealers, various government entities, and individuals. We typically seek to locate our retail auto parts stores in major population centers with convenient road access. Our auto parts store network spans 16 states in the U.S. and two provinces in Western Canada, with a majority of the stores concentrated in regions where our large-scale shredders are located. Through our network of auto parts stores, we seek to obtain salvaged vehicles from four primary sources: private parties, tow companies, auto auctions, and municipal and other contracts. We have a program to purchase vehicles from private parties called Cash for Junk Cars which is advertised in local markets. Private parties either call a toll-free number and receive a quote for their vehicle or obtain an instant online quote. The private party can either deliver the vehicle to one of our retail locations or arrange for the vehicle to be picked up. We also employ car buyers who travel to vendors and bid on vehicles. Further, we enter into limited duration contracts with public entities and other third parties for vehicle dismantling and asset recovery services, which provide a source of low-cost salvage vehicles. The expiration of such contracts may lead us to seek alternative sources of vehicles, potentially at a higher cost. We also source scrap metal and other recyclable materials through our recycling services from a range of customers including large retailers, industrial manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, and railcar owners. 
 The majority of our metal collection and processing facilities receive unprocessed metal via major railroad routes, waterways, or highways. Metals recycling facilities situated near industrial manufacturing and major transportation routes have the competitive advantage of reduced freight costs because of the significant cost of freight relative to the cost of metal. The locations of our West Coast facilities provide access to sources of unprocessed metal in the Northern California region, northward to Western Canada and Alaska, and to the East, including Idaho, Montana, Utah, Colorado, and Nevada. The locations of our East Coast facilities provide access to sources of unprocessed metal in New York, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Eastern Canada, and, from time to time, the Midwest. The locations of our facilities in Hawaii and Puerto Rico provide access to sources of unprocessed metal in the respective local markets. In the Southeastern U.S., approximately half of our ferrous and nonferrous unprocessed metal volume is purchased from industrial companies, including auto manufacturers, with the remaining volume being purchased from smaller dealers and individuals. These industrial companies provide us with metals that are by-products of their manufacturing processes. 
 The supply of scrap metal from these various sources can fluctuate with the level of economic activity in the U.S. and can be sensitive to variability in recycled metal prices, particularly in the short term, as well as in costs such as labor and energy incurred by suppliers to generate scrap metal at economically viable levels. Additionally, in periods of declining or lower recycled metal prices, suppliers may elect to hold scrap metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities, tightening supply. The effects of competition for supply of scrap metal, including of specific grades, can significantly impact the flow of scrap volumes into our facilities, our metal spreads, and our operating margins. Changes in economic activity in the U.S., interest rates, and inflation can also impact consumer and business behavior that can lead to fluctuations in the supply of scrap metal, including end-of-life vehicles, which impacts our processed volumes and operating margins. The supply of scrap metal can also fluctuate, to a lesser degree, due to seasonal factors, such as severe weather conditions, which can inhibit scrap metal collections at our facilities and production levels in our facilities. Severe weather conditions can also adversely impact the timing of shipments of our products, the level of manufacturing activity utilizing our products, and retail admissions at our auto parts stores. 
 We operate an EAF steel mill in the Western U.S. that sources substantially all its recycled metal requirements from integrated metals recycling and joint venture operations. These operations provide our steel mill a mix of recycled metal grades, which allow the mill to achieve optimum efficiency in its melting operations.

 RADIUS RECYCLING, INC. 

Energy Supply 
 We require electricity to run our steel manufacturing operations, primarily its EAF. We purchase electricity under a long-term contract with McMinnville Water Light MW L ), which in turn relies on the Bonneville Power Administration. We entered into our current contract with MW L in October 2011 that expires in September 2028. Our steel manufacturing operation also needs natural gas to operate its reheat furnace, which is used to reheat billets prior to moving them through the rolling mill. We address this demand through a natural gas agreement that obligates us at each month-end to purchase a volume of gas based on our projected needs for the immediately subsequent month on a take-or-pay basis priced using published natural gas indices. We periodically enter third-party contracts that mitigate the effect of changes in index prices on our natural gas cost for a portion of our consumption. The combined electricity and natural gas costs for our steel mill represented approximately 1 of our consolidated cost of goods sold in each of fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022. 
 Competition 
 We compete in the U.S. and in Western Canada for the purchase of scrap metal with large, well-financed recyclers of scrap metal, steel mills that own metal recycling facilities, and with smaller metals facilities and dealers. We also compete with brokers that buy scrap or recycled metal on behalf of domestic and foreign steel mills. Our auto stores compete for the purchase of end-of-life vehicles with other auto dismantlers, used car dealers, auto auctions, and metals recyclers. In general, the competitive factors impacting the purchase of scrap metal and end-of-life vehicles are the price offered by the purchaser, the proximity of the purchaser to the source of scrap metal and end-of-life vehicles, and the purchaser s ability to efficiently collect the scrap metal and end-of-life vehicles from certain suppliers locations. 
 Demand for our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions, structural and cyclical changes in markets, and other factors. For example, in fiscal 2024 and 2023, an environment of slower economic activity contributed to weaker market conditions for recycled ferrous metals globally, contributing to significantly lower average net selling prices compared to prior periods. We compete globally for the sale of processed recycled metal to finished steel and other metal product producers. The predominant competitive factors that impact recycled metal sales are price (including duties and shipping cost), reliability of service, product quality, the relative value of the U.S. dollar, foreign exports of low-priced finished and semi-finished steel products, and the availability and price of raw material alternatives, including recycled metal substitutes, such as pig iron, direct reduced iron, and hot briquetted iron (all three derived from iron ore), and semi-finished products, such as steel billets. Our ability to compete in certain export markets may be impacted by sanctions and trade actions, such as tariffs, quotas, and other import restrictions, and by licensing and inspection requirements. Further, our ability to sell into certain countries may be subject to product quality requirements. Such restrictions may require us to perform additional processing and packaging of certain recycled nonferrous metal products, as well as engage in increased inspection and certification activities, in order to continue selling into the affected markets. 
 We also compete for the sale of used auto parts to retail customers with other self-service and full-service auto dismantlers. The auto parts industry is characterized by diverse and fragmented competition and comprises a large number of aftermarket and used auto parts suppliers of all sizes, ranging from large, multinational corporations which serve both original equipment manufacturers and the aftermarket on a worldwide basis to small, local entities which have more limited supply. The main competitive factors impacting the retail sale of auto parts are price, availability and visibility of product, quality, and convenience of the retail stores to customers. 
 Our ability to process substantial volumes of recycled metal products, our use of advanced processing and separation equipment, the number and geographic dispersion of our locations, our access to a variety of different modes of transportation, and the operating synergies of our integrated platform provide our business with the ability to compete successfully in varying market conditions. 
 Our primary domestic competitors for the sale of finished steel products include manufacturing facilities from large steel manufacturers in Arizona, Utah, and Washington. In addition to domestic competition, we compete with foreign steel producers, principally located in Asia, Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, primarily in shorter length rebar and certain wire rod grades. The principal competitive factors in the steel market currently are price, quality, service, product availability, and the relative value of the U.S. dollar.

For more than a decade, our steel manufacturing operation, as part of a U.S. industry coalition, petitioned the U.S. Government under our international trade laws for relief in the form of antidumping and countervailing duties against wire rod and rebar products from a number of foreign countries. Many of those cases were successful, and the resulting antidumping and countervailing duty orders led to a decrease in finished steel imports into our domestic markets from the peak reached in fiscal 2016. Those antidumping and countervailing duty orders remained in effect during fiscal 2024. The duties imposed as part of these orders are periodically reassessed through the administrative review process. In addition, the U.S. Government conducts sunset reviews every five years to determine whether revocation of the orders would likely lead to resumption of dumping and subsidization and negatively impact the U.S. domestic industry. Affirmative decisions allow the orders to continue for an additional five years. During fiscal 2024, a sunset review of the antidumping duty orders covering rebar from Belarus, China, Indonesia, Latvia, Moldova, Poland and Ukraine was initiated. The results are expected to be announced in November 2024. If the final determination in any of these reviews is to revoke one or more of the orders, imports from those countries could increase which would negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. 
 There are also a number of antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect in Canada covering rebar from many countries that we expect will continue to lead to a reduction in the volume of imports into Canada from these countries. 
 The long-term effectiveness of existing antidumping and countervailing duty orders related to imports of wire rod and rebar products is largely uncertain and is impacted by the level and pricing of imports and the U.S. Government s assessment of antidumping and countervailing duty margins as well as its assessment of continued injury to the U.S. industry as part of the sunset review process. 
 In March 2018, the United States imposed tariffs in the amount of 25 percent and 10 percent on imports of certain steel and aluminum products, respectively. The imposition of the tariffs was the conclusion of an investigation started in April 2017 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that allows for an exemption from normal international trade rules if imports of a product are harming national security. Currently, imports from certain countries, including Canada and Mexico, are exempt from these duties pursuant to various agreements, including quotas. The Department of Commerce also implemented an exclusion process whereby U.S. entities can request that certain products be excluded from the Section 232 tariffs. We review any exclusion requests relevant to our product line to determine whether an objection might be appropriate. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Impact of Legislation and Regulation 
 Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our operations. Our businesses are subject to extensive and rapidly evolving local, state, and federal environmental protection, health, safety, and transportation laws and regulations relating to, among others: 
 The discharge of materials and emissions into the air; 

The prevention and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, including site investigations and cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA 

The management, treatment, and discharge of wastewater and storm water; 

The generation, discharge, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials and secondary materials; 

The protection of our employees health and safety; and 

Climate change generally. 

Environmental sustainability-related legislation and regulations have been changing rapidly in recent years, and it is likely that we will be subject to more stringent standards in the future. Legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress on multiple occasions to address greenhouse gas GHG emissions and global climate change. In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA ), which, among other things, creates financial incentives intended to combat climate change, including by directly or indirectly discouraging use of oil and natural gas in favor of alternative sources of energy. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how the climate-related measures in the IRA may affect our operations. A number of states, including states in which we have operations and facilities, have considered, are considering, or have already enacted legislation or taken executive action addressing climate change and GHG emissions, including state-level cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, and other requirements relating to the reduction of carbon footprints and/or GHG emissions. For example, new laws in California (i) will require companies doing business in the state with more than 1 billion in total annual revenues to annually disclose their Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions starting in 2026 (for the prior financial year, starting on or after January 1, 2025) and their Scope 3 emissions starting in 2027 (for the prior financial year, starting on or after January 1, 2026); and/or (ii) will require companies doing business in the state with annual revenues over 500

million to biannually disclose their climate-related financial risks and the measures they have adopted to reduce and adapt to those risks. The laws are currently subject to litigation in federal court. Additionally, in March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC adopted final rules that will require certain climate-related disclosures including, but not limited to, capitalized costs and expenses related to severe weather events and other natural conditions subject to certain materiality thresholds, as well as Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions disclosures. As the rules currently stand, we will be subject to such disclosure requirements no earlier than our fiscal 2026 annual filing. In April 2024, the SEC issued a voluntary stay on the rules effective date pending completion of the litigation. 
 Currently, we are required to annually report GHG emissions from our steel mill to the State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality ODEQ and the EPA, and our operations in Oregon are subject to or may be impacted by ODEQ regulations, standards, and programs aimed at limiting GHG emissions and toxic air emissions in the state including from large stationary sources such as our steel mill and Portland metals recycling facility. The implementation of such regulations, standards, and programs and any associated costs, including any operating or capital expenditures, are uncertain, but may be material to our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. In addition, we have and continue to incur material capital expenditures to enclose and install additional emission controls for our shredders to meet air emission standards or other regulatory requirements. See Compliance with existing and future climate change, greenhouse gas, and other air emission laws and regulations may adversely impact our operating results in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our steel mill has an operating permit issued under Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which governs certain air quality standards. The permit is based on an annual production capacity of approximately 950 thousand tons. In connection with the Cleaner Air Oregon program, the facility voluntarily stated its annual production would not exceed 740 thousand tons. The permit was first issued in 1998 and has since been renewed multiple times, most recently in April 2020 extending the permit through April 1, 2025. By letter dated June 22, 2023, ODEQ notified us that it intended to reopen our Title V permit for the steel mill for the purpose of incorporating the emissions of a third-party contractor that has operated on a portion of the site for decades. We have objected to such action and are engaged in discussions with ODEQ. 
 Federal, state, and local regulators have increased their focus on metals recycling and auto dismantling facilities that has or could lead to new or expanding regulatory requirements. For example, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control DTSC has increased its enforcement actions and sought to impose additional permitting and regulatory requirements on the metals recycling industry in the state that has resulted in increased scrutiny and could in the future further increase, operating and compliance costs and require additional capital expenditures. In addition, in July 2021, the EPA issued an enforcement alert reflecting a national enforcement initiative in conjunction with state regulators focused on Clean Air Act compliance at metal recycling facilities that operate auto and scrap metal shredders. While we believe we are an industry leader in air emission controls and have been working with state and local regulators on compliance and permitting matters, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to enforcement actions or litigation by regulators or private parties that could result in additional penalties, compliance requirements, or capital investments. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this report. 
 The U.S. Federal Government and state and local regulators are also emphasizing efforts to strengthen environmental compliance and enforcement, including with respect to clean-up actions under superfund and hazardous waste laws, in overburdened communities that may be disproportionately impacted by adverse health and environmental effects. On September 10, 2021, U.S. EPA Region 9 and the California Environmental Protection Agency announced a joint effort to expand environmental enforcement in overburdened California communities. These initiatives, along with new legislation and regulations, could result in increased enforcement, compliance, and clean-up costs, including increased capital expenditures, at our facilities located at or near such communities. 
 Although our objective is to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we have, in the past, incurred liabilities, expenditures, fines, and penalties associated with violations of certain of these laws and regulations. In December 2000, for example, we were notified by the EPA that we are one of the potentially responsible parties that owns or operates, or formerly owned or operated, sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site Portland Harbor ). Further, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party at sites other than Portland Harbor currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other sites where we may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities. Storm water regulation and compliance is also the subject of regulatory oversight and third-party citizen suits, and has resulted and is expected in the future to result in increased operating costs and capital expenditures. 
 See further discussion of Portland Harbor and other environmental-related matters in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
 We incurred capital expenditures related to environmental projects of 21 million, 33 million, and 35 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and we expect to spend in the range of 30 million to 40 million on capital expenditures related to environmental projects in fiscal 2025.

Indirect Consequences of Recent or Future Legislation and Regulation 
 Recent or future legislation or increased regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our business and our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, emissions controls, environmental monitoring and reporting, information technology systems, and other costs in order to comply with laws and regulations concerning and limitations imposed on climate change and GHG emissions. The potential costs of allowances, taxes, fees, offsets, or credits that may be part of cap and trade programs or similar future legislative or regulatory measures are still uncertain, and the future of these programs or measures is unknown. Any adopted future climate change and GHG laws or regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to or complying with such requirements. Furthermore, even without such laws or regulations, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the metals recycling and steel manufacturing industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our products. 
 GHG legislation and regulation are expected to have an effect on the future price of transportation fuels, natural gas used in the manufacturing process including at our steel mill, and electricity, especially electricity generated using carbon-based fuels. Since the electricity supply for our steel mill includes a significant element of hydro-generated production which is not subject to GHG legislation and regulation, its energy costs are less likely to be impacted than those of competitors using electricity generated by carbon-based fuels. In addition, demand for recycled metal may increase from mills with blast furnaces as they seek to maximize the recycled metal component of raw material infeed, which requires less energy than melting iron ore. 
 Because the use of recycled iron and steel instead of iron ore to make new steel results in savings in the consumption of energy, virgin materials, and water and reduces mining wastes and other harmful environmental impacts, we believe our recycled metal products and recycling services position us to be more competitive in the future for business from companies wishing to reduce their carbon footprint and impact on the environment. In addition, the EAF at our steel mill generates significantly less GHG emissions than traditional blast furnaces. 
 Physical Impacts of Climate Change on Our Costs and Operations 
 There has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with higher temperatures, lower snowpack, drier forests, rising sea levels as well as extreme weather events and conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, wildfires, and snow or ice storms. For instance, although the impact on our operations was not significant, certain of our facilities in Puerto Rico have experienced damage due to hurricanes, including as a result of Hurricane Fiona in September 2022, and certain of our facilities in California, Oregon, and Washington were briefly closed in September 2020 due to poor air quality as a result of wildfires. Extreme weather conditions may increase our costs or cause damage to our facilities, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. As many of our recycling facilities are located near deepwater ports, rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to receive scrap metal, process the scrap metal through our shredders, and ship products to our customers. Periods of extended adverse weather conditions may inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal inflows to our recycling facilities, retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores, and provision of our recycling services. Potential adverse impacts from climate change, including rising temperatures and extreme weather events and conditions, may create health and safety issues for employees operating at our facilities and may lead to an inability to maintain standard operating hours.

Human Capital Resources 
 Employees 
 We hire employees from across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada and have employees residing in all states, territories, and provinces in which we operate. We aim to offer a competitive compensation package and suite of benefits that align our employees with the interests of our strategic long-term growth and our customers, communities, and shareholders. As of August 31, 2024, we had 3,011 full-time employees, 724 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of our full-time employees as of August 31, 2024, approximately 95 resided in the United States. 
 Engagement 
 We believe employee engagement contributes significantly to our operational performance, achievement of our strategic goals, and the growth and development of our employees. Our leaders sponsor and, in many cases, lead employee engagement initiatives focusing on diversity, equity, inclusion, volunteering, community involvement, and job satisfaction. In July 2024, for the fourth consecutive year, we were recognized as a certified Great Place to Work . Achieving this prominent designation followed an all-employee Trust Index Survey process which had requested the views and beliefs of our employees. 
 Health Safety 
 Safety is one of our core values. Our approach to safety is proactive and focuses on active leadership, fostering care and engagement, risk and hazard identification, training, frequent verification of the controls associated with higher-risk processes, applying what we learn from incidents, and using data to analyze and obtain insights to help reduce injuries and incidents. Creating a positive health and safety culture takes time and visible leadership that demonstrates care and concern for the health and safety of our employees. 
 We regularly track and evaluate numerous leading indicators, which are proactive, preventive, and predictive measures that provide information about the effective performance of our health and safety systems, processes, and critical controls, and which allow us to take preventive action to address lapses or hazards before they turn into an incident. Leading indicators that we use in connection with our health and safety programs include employee training and attendance, workplace inspections, corrective action closure rates, hazard response time analysis, and frequency and quality of layered safety observations conducted at all levels of the organization. 
 We also track health and safety performance using industry-standard metrics including but not limited to the following: 
 Total Case Incident Rate TCIR 

Days Away, Restricted, or Transferred DART Rate 

Lost Time Incident Rate LTIR 

We work continuously to improve all aspects of our health and safety performance. Our safety strategy emphasizes the prevention of serious injuries and fatalities, works toward achieving zero injuries, and empowers employees to cultivate personal safety leadership. With zero injuries as our ultimate aspiration, we are working toward a near-term goal of a 1.00 TCIR by the end of fiscal 2025 (one recordable injury per 200,000 working hours). There was a year-over-year decrease in recordable injuries and associated rates in fiscal 2024. We also observed an overall decrease in the severity and number of significant injuries. Enhanced safety engagements counterbalanced these fluctuations, increased hourly participation in workplace observations, and improved incident learning and communications practices, reflecting our commitment to ongoing safety improvement. 
 Ethics 
 Our employees, both union and non-union, participate in annual training on our Company s Core Values of Safety, Sustainability, and Integrity, which includes instruction on our Code of Conduct and ethical behavior. The training includes important topics such as reporting misconduct, prohibition against retaliation, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the Company's sustainability program. We also provide training to employees regarding unconscious bias. We empower employees to raise issues and concerns regarding compliance with our Code of Conduct, Company policies, and the law by offering multiple reporting channels, including a third-party, confidential, multi-lingual misconduct reporting system where employees may choose to remain anonymous.

 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 Described below are risks, which are categorized as Risk Factors Relating to Our Business, Risk Factors Relating to the Regulatory Environment, and Risk Factors Relating to Our Employees, that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows or could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. See Forward-Looking Statements that precedes Part I of this report. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial may in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 Risk Factors Relating to Our Business 
 Potential costs related to the environmental cleanup of Portland Harbor may be material to our financial position and liquidity 
 In December 2000, we were notified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA that we are one of the potentially responsible parties PRPs that owns or operates or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to Portland Harbor. In January 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision ROD that identified the selected remedy for Portland Harbor. The EPA has estimated the total cost of the selected remedy at 1.7 billion with a net present value cost of 1.05 billion (at a 7 discount rate) and an estimated construction period of 13 years following completion of the remedial designs. In the ROD, the EPA stated that the cost estimate is an order-of-magnitude engineering estimate that is expected to be within +50 to -30 of the actual project cost and that changes in the cost elements are likely to occur as a result of new information and data collected during the engineering design. Accordingly, the final cost may differ materially from that set forth in the ROD. The ROD provided only site-wide cost estimates and did not provide sufficient detail to estimate costs for specific sediment management areas within Portland Harbor. In addition, the ROD did not determine or allocate the responsibility for remediation costs among the PRPs. Except for certain early action projects in which we are not involved, remediation activities at Portland Harbor are not expected to commence for a number of years. Moreover, those activities are expected to be sequenced, and the order and timing of such sequencing has not been determined. We have joined with approximately 100 other PRPs in a voluntary process to establish an allocation of costs at Portland Harbor. We expect the next major stage of the allocation process to proceed in parallel with the remedial design process. In addition to the remedial action process overseen by the EPA, the Portland Harbor Natural Resource Trustee Council Trustee Council is assessing natural resource damages at Portland Harbor. We are working with the Trustee Council to finalize an early settlement of our alleged natural resource damage liability at Portland Harbor. Our environmental liabilities as of both August 31, 2024 and 2023 included 8 million and 5 million, respectively, relating to the Portland Harbor matters described above. Because the final remedial actions have not yet been designed and there has not been a determination of the allocation among the PRPs of costs of the investigations or remedial action costs, we believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely to or which it is reasonably possible that we will incur in connection with Portland Harbor, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Among the facts being evaluated are detailed information on the history of ownership of and the nature of the uses of and activities and operations performed on each property within Portland Harbor, which are factors that will play a substantial role in determining the allocation of investigation and remedy costs among the PRPs. We have insurance policies that we believe will provide reimbursement for costs we incur for defense, remedial design, remedial action, and mitigation for or settlement of natural resource damages claims in connection with Portland Harbor. Most of these policies jointly insure us and MMGL, LLC MMGL ), an unaffiliated company, as the successor to a former subsidiary. We and MMGL have negotiated the settlement with certain insurers of claims against us related to Portland Harbor, continue to seek settlements with other insurers, and formed two Qualified Settlement Funds QSFs which became operative in fiscal 2020 and 2023, respectively, to hold such settlement amounts until funds are needed to pay or reimburse costs incurred 
 14 / Radius Recycling, Inc. Form 10-K Fiscal 2024

by us and MMGL in connection with Portland Harbor. These insurance policies and the funds in the QSFs may not cover all of the costs which we may incur. 
 The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality is separately providing oversight of our investigations and source control activities at various sites adjacent to Portland Harbor that are focused on controlling any current uplands releases of contaminants into the Willamette River. We have accrued liabilities for source control and related work at two sites, reflecting estimated costs of primarily investigation and design, which costs have not been material in the aggregate to date. No liabilities have been established in connection with investigations for any other sites because the extent of contamination, required source control work, and our responsibility for the contamination and source control work, in each case if any, have not yet been determined. In addition, pursuant to our insurance policies, we are being reimbursed for the costs we incur for required source control evaluation and remediation work. 
 Significant cash outflows in the future related to Portland Harbor could reduce the amount of our borrowing capacity that could otherwise be used for investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. Any material liabilities or cash expenditures, net of recoveries, incurred in the future related to Portland Harbor could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements. See Contingencies Environmental in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail on these matters. 
 Equipment upgrades, equipment failures, and facility damage may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns 
 Our business operations and recycling and manufacturing processes depend on critical pieces of equipment, including information technology equipment, shredders, nonferrous sorting technology, furnaces, and a rolling mill, which may be out of service occasionally for scheduled upgrades or maintenance or as a result of unanticipated failures or events. Our facilities are subject to equipment failures and the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as mechanical failures, fires, earthquakes, accidents, or violent weather conditions. For instance, although the impact on our operations as a result of natural disasters has not been significant to date, certain of our facilities in Puerto Rico have experienced damage due to hurricanes, including as a result of Hurricane Fiona in September 2022, and certain facilities in California, Oregon, and Washington were briefly closed in September 2020 due to poor air quality as a result of wildfires. Additionally, we experienced a fire at our Cascade Steel Rolling Mills in McMinnville, Oregon in May 2021 as well as at our metals recycling facility in Everett, Massachusetts in December 2021. While we carry insurance that applies to the repair and replacement of property that experienced physical loss or damage and business income losses resulting from events such as these two fires, as discussed in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, and various conditions, exclusions, and limits. Moreover, our insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses in the case of future events. In addition, insurance may not continue to be available in the future on acceptable terms or at acceptable costs. Interruptions in our processing and production capabilities and shutdowns resulting from unanticipated events also could disrupt customer and supplier relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Failure to realize or delays in realizing expected benefits from capital projects, including investments in processing and manufacturing technology improvements and information technology systems, may impact our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows 
 We may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics, political and regulatory environments, and the expected return on the capital to be employed in the project. Large-scale projects may take many years to complete, during which time the political and regulatory environment or other market conditions may change from our forecast. For example, we make significant investments in processing and manufacturing technology improvements and other information technology systems aimed at increasing the efficiency and capabilities of our businesses and to maximize our economies of scale. Completion of and realization of the benefits from such improvements may be subject to many factors including, but not limited to, permitting, construction, equipment delivery, commissioning and ramp up, environmental compliance, and technology performance risks, some of which are outside our control and could result in further delays in such projects or require us to incur additional costs. Vendors may be unable to deliver on their commitments and permitting agencies may be delayed in issuing necessary permits which can cause construction, commissioning, and ramp-up time to take significantly longer than expected. For example, we have continued to experience delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries, commissioning and ramp-up times related to our capital projects, and to the time required to obtain permits from government agencies, resulting in the deferral of certain capital expenditures and in the timing of realization of the anticipated benefits of the technology improvements. Failure to realize or delays in realizing the anticipated benefits and to generate adequate returns on such capital projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We operate in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows 
 Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and nonresidential and infrastructure construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. The cyclical nature of our operations tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, the effects of inflation, changes in interest rates, and foreign currency exchange fluctuations. For example, in fiscal 2023 and 2024 higher inflation impacted our operating costs, including, but not limited to, employee compensation costs and certain costs of production. Increasing interest rates, both domestically and internationally, could lead to slowdowns in global investment and production, resulting in reduced generation of scrap and decreased demand for our products. Economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. and foreign markets or any of the industries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 Changing conditions in global markets including the impact of sanctions and tariffs, quotas, and other trade actions and import restrictions may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows 
 We generate a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside the U.S., including countries in Asia, the Mediterranean region, and North, Central, and South America. In each of the last three years, exports comprised approximately 54 to 61 of our ferrous sales volumes and 56 to 57 of our nonferrous sales volumes. Our ability to sell our products profitably, or at all, into international markets is subject to a number of risks including adverse impacts of political, economic, military, terrorist, or major pandemic events; labor and social issues; legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments including quotas, tariffs, or other protectionist trade barriers, sanctions, adverse tax law changes, nationalization, currency restrictions, or import restrictions for certain types of products we export; and disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or other actions of government agencies. Economic and geopolitical instability, including as a result of military conflict, could give rise to turmoil in markets that could have an impact on our business. The occurrence of such events and conditions may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. For example, tariffs and import license requirements and quotas have been in place for several years in multiple jurisdictions, including China. Our ability to navigate these tariffs and restrictions is critical to our business and any changes or expansion in these tariffs and restrictions could adversely impact our business or results of operations. In addition, changing conditions in global markets may contribute to concentration in one or more of our country destinations. For example, in fiscal 2024, Bangladesh, Turkey and India comprised 85 of our ferrous export sales. 
 In March 2018, the U.S. imposed a 25 percent tariff on certain imported steel products and a 10 percent tariff on certain imported aluminum products under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Currently, imports from certain countries, including Canada and Mexico, are exempt from these duties pursuant to various agreements, including quotas. In response to a surge of imports of steel products from Mexico and a concern that third countries were circumventing the Section 232 tariffs by sending semi-finished steel to Mexico for further processing, the U.S. reimposed Section 232 tariffs on imports of Mexican steel that is not melted and poured in North America. In addition to the country exclusions, the U.S. Department of Commerce is managing a process where importers may request exclusion of specific products from the Section 232 tariffs, and interested domestic producers can object to the exclusion requests. There have been multiple legal challenges to the Section 232 actions in U.S. courts and the World Trade Organization. To date, the duties remain in place. These tariffs, along with other U.S. trade actions, have triggered retaliatory actions by certain affected countries, and other foreign governments may impose trade measures on other U.S. goods in the future. For example, China has imposed a series of retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. products, including a 25 percent tariff on all grades of U.S. scrap and an additional 25 percent tariff on U.S. aluminum scrap. These tariffs and other trade actions could result in a decrease in international steel demand and negatively impact demand for our products, which would adversely impact our business. Given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of these trade actions by the U.S. or other countries, the impact of the trade actions on our operations or results remains uncertain, but this impact could be material. 
 Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may reduce the demand for our products 
 A significant portion of our recycled metal revenues is generated from sales to foreign customers, which are denominated in U.S. dollars. At times during our 2023 and 2024 fiscal years, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to other world currencies. A strengthening U.S. dollar makes our products more expensive for non-U.S. customers, which may negatively impact our export sales. A strengthening U.S. dollar also makes imported metal products less expensive, which may result in an increase in imports of steel products into the U.S. As a result, our finished steel products, which are made in the U.S., may become more expensive for our U.S. customers relative to imported steel products thereby reducing demand for our products.

Changes in the availability or price of inputs such as raw materials and end-of-life vehicles could reduce our sales and adversely impact our margins 
 Our businesses require certain materials that are sourced from third-party suppliers. Although the synergies from our integrated operations allow us to be our own source for some raw materials, particularly with respect to recycled metal for our steel manufacturing operations, we rely on other suppliers for most of our raw material and other input needs, including inputs to steel production such as graphite electrodes, alloys, and other required consumables. Industry supply conditions generally involve risks, including the possibility of shortages of raw materials, increases in raw material and other input costs, and reduced control over delivery schedules. We procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell scrap metal to us. In periods of declining or lower recycled metal prices, suppliers may elect to hold scrap metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities, tightening supply. The effects of competition for supply of scrap metal, including of specific grades, can significantly impact the flow of scrap volumes into our facilities, our metal spreads, and our operating margins. If a substantial number of suppliers cease selling scrap metal to us, we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. For instance, in fiscal 2023 and continuing into fiscal 2024, a slowdown in economic growth in the U.S., coupled with rising interest rates and inflation, led consumers and businesses to hold on to vehicles longer, constraining the supply of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles, which resulted in significantly reduced processed volumes. A slowdown of industrial production in the U.S. may also reduce the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metals recycling industry, resulting in less recyclable metal available to process and market. Increased competition for domestic scrap metal, including as a result of overcapacity or consolidation in the metal recycling industry in the U.S. and Canada, may also reduce the supply of scrap metal available to us. Failure to obtain a steady supply of recyclable material could both adversely impact our ability to meet sales commitments and reduce our operating margins. Failure to obtain an adequate supply of end-of-life vehicles, including due to increasing trends over time in the proportion of electric vehicles sold to total vehicles sold, the pace of and the auto recycling industry response to which are uncertain, could adversely impact our ability to attract customers and charge admission fees and reduce parts sales at our auto parts stores. Failure to obtain raw materials and other inputs to steel production, such as graphite electrodes, alloys, and other required consumables, could adversely impact our ability to make steel to the specifications of our customers. 
 Significant decreases in recycled metal prices may adversely impact our operating results 
 The timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which we operate are difficult to predict and are influenced by different economic conditions in the domestic market, where we typically acquire our raw materials, and foreign markets, where we typically sell the majority of our products. Purchase prices for scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles and selling prices for recycled metal are subject to market forces beyond our control. While we attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to our metal purchase prices, our ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our metal purchase prices to fully offset a sharp reduction in recycled metal sales prices, which may adversely impact our operating income and cash flows. In addition, a rapid decrease in selling prices may compress our operating margins due to the impact of average inventory cost accounting, which causes cost of goods sold recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to decrease at a slower rate than metal purchase prices. 
 Imbalances in supply and demand conditions in the global steel industry may reduce demand for our products 
 Economic expansions and contractions in global economies can result in supply and demand imbalances in the global steel industry that can significantly affect the price of commodities used and sold by our business, as well as the price of and demand for finished steel products. In a number of foreign countries, such as China, steel producers are generally government-owned and may therefore make production decisions based on political or other factors that do not reflect free market conditions. In fiscal 2023 and increasingly in 2024, as well as in the past, overcapacity and excess steel production in these foreign countries resulted in the export of aggressively priced semi-finished and finished steel products. This led to disruptions in steel-making operations within other countries, negatively impacting demand for our recycled metal products used by EAF mills globally as their primary feedstock. Further, the import of foreign steel products into the U.S. at similarly aggressive prices have in the past adversely impacted finished steel sales prices and sales volumes. Existing or new trade laws and regulations may cause or be inadequate to prevent disadvantageous trade practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although trade regulations restrict or impose duties on the importation of certain products, if foreign steel production significantly exceeds consumption in those countries, global demand for our recycled metal products could decline and imports of steel products into the U.S. could increase, resulting in lower volumes and selling prices for our recycled metal products and finished steel products.

Acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences 
 We have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or expand into complementary businesses to enable us to expand our customer and supplier base and grow our revenues. Execution of any past or potential future acquisition or expansion involves several risks, including: 
 Difficulty integrating the acquired businesses personnel and operations; 

Challenges in obtaining permits or meeting other regulatory requirements; 

Potential loss of key employees, customers, or suppliers of the acquired business; 

Difficulties in realizing anticipated cost savings, efficiencies, and synergies; 

Unexpected costs; 

Inaccurate assessment of or undisclosed liabilities; 

Inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, and procedures; 

Disruption to existing businesses; and 

Difficulty in managing growth. 

If we do not successfully execute on acquisitions or expansions and the acquired or expanded businesses do not perform as projected, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Supply chain disruptions affecting our customers, end users of our recycled products, or our suppliers could adversely impact the demand for our products or the availability of inputs, increase our costs, or otherwise adversely impact our business 
 Supply chain disruptions and related labor shortages and logistics constraints have and could continue to impact our customers, end users of our recycled products, and our suppliers and adversely impact our business. Direct and indirect impacts on our business of such supply chain disruptions could include reduction in the demand for and price of certain of our products, slowdown in flows of scrap metal from certain supply channels, and reduced availability or increases in costs of other inputs, consumables, supplies, and capital equipment. Disruptions within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver our products in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in reduced volumes and sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions in the future may result from a number of factors beyond our control. Supply chain disruptions due to any of those factors could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition. 
 Reliance on third-party shipping companies may restrict our ability to ship our products 
 We significantly rely on third parties to handle and transport raw materials to our production facilities and products to customers. Despite our practice of utilizing a diversified group of suppliers of transportation, factors beyond our control, including changes in fuel prices, political events, governmental regulation of transportation, changes in market rates, carrier availability, carrier bankruptcy, labor shortages, shipping industry consolidation, and disruptions in transportation routes and infrastructure, may adversely impact our ability to ship our products and our operating margins. These impacts could include delays or other disruptions in shipments in transit, including as a result of congested seaports and travel routes, or third-party shipping companies increasing their charges for transportation services or otherwise reducing or eliminating the availability of their containers, vehicles, rail cars, barges, or ships. For example, during fiscal 2022, worldwide demand for logistical services increased sharply, which led to a global shortage of available shipping containers, congested seaports, and higher freight rates, impacting the timing of certain shipments and resulting in reductions in sales volumes of certain products. The delays in container shipping for U.S. exports were exacerbated by the backlog of containerized imports at U.S. seaports. While we aim to pass on the majority of shipping and related charges to our customers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so into the future. As a result, we may not be able to transport our products in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may harm our reputation.

The agreement governing our bank credit facilities imposes certain restrictions on our business and contains financial covenants 
 Our secured bank credit facilities contain certain restrictions on our business which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business or execute our strategy and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Our bank credit agreement also requires that we maintain certain financial and other covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may also be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or financial covenants could result in an event of default under the bank credit agreement and permit our lenders to cease lending to us and declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. This could require us to refinance our bank facilities, which we may not be able to do at terms acceptable to us, or at all. 
 Potential limitations on our ability to access capital resources may restrict our ability to operate 
 Our operations are capital intensive. Our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. While we expect that our cash requirements, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service, dividends, share repurchases, and investments, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our secured committed bank credit facilities, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources. Although we believe we have adequate access to contractually committed borrowings, we could be adversely affected if we are not able to meet the conditions required to incur such borrowing or if our banks ceased lending or were unable to honor their contractual commitments. Failure to access our credit facilities could restrict our ability to fund operations, make capital expenditures, or execute acquisitions. 
 Impairment of goodwill, long-lived and other assets may adversely affect our operating results 
 Our long-lived asset groups are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable because it exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the operations related to the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized by the amount the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment annually, and when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be impaired. The results of these tests for potential impairment, as well as the number and frequency of identified triggering events indicating potential impairment, may be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions, our financial performance trends, or an increase in interest rates, among other factors. If, as a result of an impairment test, we determine that the fair value of any of our long-lived asset groups or our goodwill is less than its carrying amount, we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to goodwill and long-lived assets, we carry other assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing and potential loss recognition in accordance with applicable accounting standards. These other assets include, but are not limited to, investments in the equity of unconsolidated entities, assets held for sale, and assets abandoned either before or after they are placed in service. Impairment of long-lived and other assets, if incurred in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Public health emergencies, such as pandemics or epidemics, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows 
 Our operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics, or other public health emergencies. Such events could lead to restrictions and mandates, which could be applied differently across jurisdictions, and there could be global impacts resulting directly or indirectly from such an event including labor shortages, logistical challenges, and supply chain disruptions such as increased port congestion, and increases in costs for certain goods and services. For instance, the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which the World Health Organization characterized as a global public health emergency from March 2020 through May 2023, negatively affected our business and ongoing global impacts have negatively affected our sales volumes, operating costs, and financial results to varying degrees and could continue to negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position in the future. 
 Inability to achieve or sustain the benefits from productivity, cost savings, and restructuring initiatives may adversely impact our operating results 
 During the past several years, we implemented a number of productivity improvement, cost savings, and restructuring initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses and improve profitability and to achieve further integration and synergistic cost efficiencies in our operating platform. These initiatives included implementing productivity initiatives to increase production efficiency and material

recovery, reducing certain operating expenses through headcount reductions, reducing organizational layers, consolidating shared service functions, savings from procurement activities, streamlining of administrative and supporting services functions, other non-headcount measures, and idling underutilized assets and closing facilities to more closely align our business to market conditions. For example, during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024, we announced and began implementing productivity and cost reduction initiatives with a targeted annual benefit of approximately 70 million. These initiatives aim to improve profitability through a combination of increased yields, efficiencies in processing, procurement, and pricing, and reduced costs including from headcount reductions, decreased lease costs, professional and outside services, and implementation of operational efficiencies. We may undertake similar or additional productivity initiatives in the future in the normal course or in response to market conditions. Our ability to achieve or sustain the anticipated cost reductions and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive, and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. We have incurred, and may incur in the future, restructuring charges and other exit-related activities as a result of such initiatives. Failure to achieve or sustain the expected cost reductions and other benefits related to these productivity improvements, cost savings, and restructuring initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may be unable to renew facility leases, thus restricting our ability to operate 
 We lease a significant portion of our facilities, including the substantial majority of our auto parts facilities. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to renew these leases or find suitable alternative locations for our facilities may impact our ability to continue operations within certain geographic areas, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Changing economic conditions may result in customers not fulfilling their contractual obligations 
 We enter into export ferrous sales contracts preceded by negotiations that include fixing price, quantity, shipping terms, and other contractual terms. Upon finalization of these terms and satisfactory completion of other contractual contingencies, the customer typically opens a letter of credit to satisfy its payment obligation under the contract prior to our shipment of the cargo. In times of changing economic conditions, including during periods of sharply falling recycled metal prices and global financial instability, there is an increased risk that customers may not be willing or able to fulfill their contractual obligations or open letters of credit. As of August 31, 2024 and 2023, 28 and 38 , respectively, of our accounts receivable balance were covered by letters of credit. In addition, in higher or rising commodity price environments and during periods of challenging global macroeconomic and steel industry conditions, we have experienced proportionately lower credit insurance coverage of applicable customer credit limits, which may increase our exposure to customer credit risk. 
 Consolidation in the steel industry may reduce demand for our products 
 There has been consolidation in the steel industry that has included steel mills acquiring steel fabricators to ensure demand for their products. If any of our steel mill s significant remaining customers were to be acquired by competing steel mills, this could reduce the demand for our products and force us to lower our prices, reducing our revenues, or to reduce production, which could increase our unit costs and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Product liability claims may adversely impact our operating results 
 We could inadvertently acquire radioactive scrap metal that could potentially be included in recycled mixed metal shipped to consumers worldwide. Although we have invested in radiation detection equipment in the majority of our locations, including the facilities from which we ship directly to customers, failure to detect radioactive metal remains a possibility. Even though we maintain insurance to address the risk of this failure in detection, there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage would be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. In addition, if we fail to meet contractual requirements for a product, we may be subject to product warranty costs and claims. These costs and claims could both have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation. 
 We are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity 
 We spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. Notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various matters, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade, and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. For example, legal proceedings can include those arising from accidents involving Company-owned vehicles, including Company tractor trailers. In some instances, 
 20 / Radius Recycling, Inc. Form 10-K Fiscal 2024

 RADIUS RECYCLING, INC. 

such accidents and the related litigation involve accidents that have resulted in third-party fatalities. An outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation in excess of insurance recoveries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings and contingencies, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies Other in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
 Climate change may adversely impact our facilities and our ongoing operations 
 The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present, for example rising sea levels at our deepwater port facilities, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. As many of our recycling facilities are located near deepwater ports, rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to receive scrap metal, process the metal through our shredders, and ship products to our customers. Extreme weather events and conditions, such as wildfires, hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and snow or ice storms, may increase our costs or cause damage to our facilities, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. Increased frequency and duration of adverse weather events and conditions may also inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal inflows to our recycling facilities, and retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores. Potential adverse impacts from climate change, including rising temperatures and extreme weather events and conditions, may create health and safety issues for employees operating at our facilities and may lead to an inability to maintain standard operating hours. 
 We may not realize our deferred tax assets in the future 
 The assessment of recoverability of our deferred tax assets is based on an evaluation of existing positive and negative evidence as to whether it is more-likely-than-not that they will be realized. If negative evidence outweighs positive evidence, a valuation allowance is required. Factors that may result in a valuation allowance include significant negative industry or economic trends, a decrease in earnings performance and projections of future taxable income, adverse changes in laws or regulations, and a variety of other factors. Recording a valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In the past, we have recorded significant valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets may require further valuation allowances if it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. See Note 16 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail on valuation allowances. 
 Tax increases and changes in tax rules may adversely affect our financial results 
 As a company conducting business on a global basis with physical operations throughout North America, we are exposed, both directly and indirectly, to the effects of changes in U.S., state, local, and foreign tax rules. Taxes for financial reporting purposes and cash tax liabilities in the future may be adversely affected by changes in such tax rules. For example, a new gross revenue tax has been proposed in the State of Oregon, which, if enacted, could result in increased tax burden independent of reduced profitability due to market conditions. The proposed change reflects a broader trend of jurisdictions seeking to increase tax revenue from corporations. Such changes may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our major competitors, to the extent we are unable to pass the tax costs through to our customers. 
 One or more cybersecurity incidents may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation 
 Our operations involve the use of multiple systems, some of which are outsourced to certain third-party service and hosting providers, that process, store, and transmit sensitive information about our customers, suppliers, employees, financial position, operating results, and strategies. We face global cybersecurity risks and threats on a continual and ongoing basis, which include, but are not limited to, attempts to access systems and information, computer viruses, or denial-of-service attacks. These risks and threats range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures. Increased numbers of employees working remotely increases our exposure to cyber-threats. While we are not aware of any material cyber-attacks or breaches of our systems to date, such attempts occur regularly and, thus, we have and continue to implement measures to safeguard our systems and information and mitigate potential risks, including employee training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks, but there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems, compromise sensitive information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business due to disruption of operations and/or reputational damage, potential liability and increased remediation and protection costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, as cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated, we may need to increase our investments in security measures which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business and financial results 
 Increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to ESG matters in public discourse and the investment community. A number of advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote ESG-related change at public companies, including, but not limited to, through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, pension funds, universities and other members of the investing community. 
 These activities have also aimed to increase the attention on and demand for action related to various ESG matters, which has contributed to increasing societal, investor, and legislative focus and pressure on ESG practices and disclosures, including those related to climate change, GHG emissions targets, business resilience under the assumptions of demand-constrained scenarios, net-zero ambitions, transition plans, actions related to diversity and inclusion, political activities, racial equity audits, and governance standards. As a result, we may face increasing pressure regarding our ESG practices and disclosures. Investors, stakeholders, and other interested parties are also increasingly focusing on issues related to environmental justice. This has resulted and is likely to continue to result in increased scrutiny with respect to our business and operations, which could in turn result in the cancellation or delay of projects, the revocation or delay of permits, termination of contracts, lawsuits, regulatory action, and policy change that may adversely affect our business strategy, increase our costs, and adversely affect our reputation and financial performance. 
 Responding to such ESG-focused activism has been and will likely continue to be costly and time-consuming. Such response efforts could also result in the implementation of certain ESG practices and/or disclosure requirements that may present a heightened level of legal and regulatory risk, or that threaten our credibility with other investors and stakeholders. The methodologies and standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters are relatively new, have not been standardized, and continue to evolve. As a result, our ESG-related disclosures, metrics, and targets may not necessarily be calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by us in other contexts, or by other companies or third-party estimates. While we believe that our ESG disclosures and methodologies reflect our business strategy and are reasonable at the time made or used, as our business or applicable methodologies, standards, or regulations develop and evolve, we may revise or cease reporting or using certain disclosures and methodologies if we determine that they are no longer advisable or appropriate. If our ESG disclosures and methodologies are or are perceived by government authorities, investors, or stakeholders to be inadequate, inaccurate, or non-compliant with applicable standards or regulations, or if we discover material inaccuracies therein, our reputation could be negatively impacted, and we could be exposed to litigation and other regulatory actions. 
 We are exposed to translation risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
 Our operations in Canada expose us to translation risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks due to exchange rate movements in connection with the translation of the operating costs and the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations into our functional currency for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our hedging transactions 
 We currently use interest rate swap derivative instruments, as well as derivative contracts for commodities used in normal business operations that are settled by physical delivery, and we expect to continue their use in the future. If the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective or increase our exposure to unexpected events or risks, we may incur losses. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with any future regulation of derivative instruments applicable to us.

Risk Factors Relating to the Regulatory Environment 
 Governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our licenses and permits, thus restricting our ability to operate 
 We conduct certain aspects of our operations subject to licenses, permits, and approvals from state and local governments. Governmental agencies often resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities, including metal recycling and auto parts facilities. Increased permitting requirements could require substantial additional capital expenditures, impose financial assurance obligations, subject us to increased compliance and penalty risks, severely limit operational flexibility, and increase operating costs, or adversely impact our ability to acquire or sell materials. Increased focus on strengthening environmental compliance and enforcement in overburdened communities that may be disproportionately impacted by adverse health and environmental effects may impact our ability to obtain or renew licenses and permits for facilities in or near such communities. In addition, changes in zoning and increased residential and mixed-use development near our facilities are reducing the buffer zones and creating land use conflicts with heavy industrial uses such as ours. This could result in increased complaints, increased inspections and enforcement including fines and penalties, operating restrictions, the need for additional capital expenditures, and increased opposition to maintaining or renewing required approvals, licenses, and permits. In addition, waste products from our operations are subject to classification and regulations that, among other things, determine how such materials may be handled, stored, transported, and disposed. Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory permits, approvals, or exemptions for such waste could materially increase our costs or limit our operations. For example, in fiscal 2022, as a result of court orders and regulatory changes, we were required at times to transport shredder waste from our Oakland facility out of state for disposal at increased costs. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings. As an additional example, our Bay Area Air Quality Management District BAAQMD permit to operate currently limits the number of ships that may call at our Oakland, California facility to 26 ships per year. In July 2018, we applied for a modification of such permit to increase the number of annual ship calls to 32 per year. BAAQMD has not acted on our permit modification request but, in the interim, had routinely issued annual Compliance and Settlement Agreements CSA to permit 32 ship calls in each year. In October 2022, however, BAAQMD declined to renew the CSA for 2022, following which we applied for and obtained a short-term variance authorizing the 32 ship calls in calendar year 2022. Unless we are able to operate within the current 26 ship call limit in any given calendar year, we will need to apply for a similar variance. Failure to obtain such a variance in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to the reduced marine shipments, and lost profits related thereto. Additionally, by letter dated June 22, 2023, ODEQ notified the Company that it intended to reopen the Company s Title V permit at the steel mill for purposes of incorporating the emissions of a third-party contractor that has operated on a portion of the site for decades. We have objected to such action and are engaged in discussions with ODEQ. 
 Furthermore, from time to time, both the U.S. and foreign governments impose regulations and restrictions on trade in the markets in which we operate. In some countries, governments require us to apply for certificates or registration before allowing shipment of recycled metal to customers in those countries. There can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses, and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses, and permits we currently hold. Failure to obtain these approvals could cause us to limit or discontinue operations in these locations or prevent us from developing or acquiring new facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Environmental compliance costs and potential environmental liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
 Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries relating to, among other matters: 
 Waste disposal; 

Air emissions; 

Waste water and storm water management, treatment, and discharge; 

The use and treatment of groundwater; 

Soil and groundwater contamination and remediation; 

Generation, discharge, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials and secondary materials; 

Employee health and safety; and 

Climate change generally. 

23 / Radius Recycling, Inc. Form 10-K Fiscal 2024

 RADIUS RECYCLING, INC. 

We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. Violation of or failure to obtain permits or comply with these laws or regulations could result in our business being fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or becoming subject to litigation by private parties. In recent years, capital expenditures for environmental projects have increased and have represented a significant share of our annual capital expenditures. Future environmental compliance costs, including capital expenditures for environmental projects, may increase because of new laws and regulations, changing regulatory interpretations and stricter enforcement of current laws and regulations by regulatory authorities, expanding emissions, groundwater, storm water and other testing requirements, and new information on emission or contaminant levels including with respect to emerging contaminants such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS ), uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, the future costs of pollution control technology, and issues related to climate change. 
 We have seen an increased focus by federal, state, and local regulators on metals recycling and auto dismantling facilities and new or expanding regulatory requirements. For example, the DTSC has increased its enforcement actions and sought to impose additional permitting and regulatory requirements on the metals recycling industry in the state that has resulted in and could in the future increase operating and compliance costs and require additional capital expenditures. In addition, in July 2021, the EPA issued an enforcement alert reflecting a national enforcement initiative in conjunction with state regulators focused on Clean Air Act compliance at metal recycling facilities that operate auto and scrap metal shredders. While we believe we are an industry leader in air emission controls and have been working with state and local regulators on compliance and permitting matters, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to enforcement actions or litigation by regulators or private parties that could result in additional penalties, compliance requirements, or capital investments. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this report. 
 In addition, previous operations by us, predecessor entities, or others at facilities that we currently or formerly owned, operated, or otherwise used may have caused contamination from hazardous substances. As a result, we are exposed to possible claims, including government fines and penalties, costs for investigation and clean-up activities, claims for natural resources damages, and claims by third parties for personal injury and property damage, under environmental laws and regulations, especially for the remediation of waterways and soil or groundwater contamination. These laws can impose liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances even if the owner or operator was neither aware of nor responsible for the release of the hazardous substances. We have, in the past, incurred liabilities, expenditures, fines and penalties associated with violations of certain of these laws and regulations. In December 2000, we were notified by the EPA that we are one of the potentially responsible parties that owns or operates, or formerly owned or operated, sites which are part of or adjacent to Portland Harbor. Further, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party at sites other than Portland Harbor currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other sites where we may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities. Environmental compliance costs and potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See also the risk factor Potential costs related to the environmental cleanup of Portland Harbor may be material to our financial position and liquidity in this Item 1A and Contingencies Environmental in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
 The U.S. Federal Government and state and local regulators are also emphasizing efforts to strengthen environmental compliance and enforcement, including with respect to clean-up actions under superfund and hazardous waste laws, in overburdened communities that may be disproportionately impacted by adverse health and environmental effects. On September 10, 2021, U.S. EPA Region 9 and the California Environmental Protection Agency announced a joint effort to expand environmental enforcement in overburdened California communities. These initiatives could result in increased enforcement, compliance, and clean-up costs, including increased capital expenditures, at our facilities located at or near such communities. 
 Compliance with existing and future climate change, greenhouse gas, and other air emission laws and regulations may adversely impact our operating results 
 Recent and future legislation or increased regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our business and our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, emissions controls, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs in order to comply with laws and regulations concerning and limitations imposed on climate change and GHG emissions. The potential costs of allowances, taxes, fees, offsets, or credits or additional emission reduction measures that may be part of cap and trade programs or other legislative or regulatory requirements are still uncertain and the future of these programs or measures is unknown. For example, in March 2020, the Governor of Oregon issued an executive order directing state agencies to take certain actions to reduce and regulate GHG emissions. Pursuant to this executive order, ODEQ adopted a new Climate Protection Program to limit GHG emissions in the state including from large stationary sources such as our steel mill. Pursuant to these regulations, the mill s GHG process emissions will be subject to a best available emission reduction technology analysis and standard and its natural gas GHG combustion emissions will be subject to the cap and annual reductions applied to its natural gas supplier. The implementation of such regulations, standards, and programs and any associated costs, including any operating or capital expenditures, are uncertain, but may be material to our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The potential increased costs to us of 
 24 / Radius Recycling, Inc. Form 10-K Fiscal 2024 

Table of Contents 
 RADIUS RECYCLING, INC. 

natural gas supplies are also uncertain. In addition, the ODEQ Cleaner Air Oregon CAO program regulates toxic air emissions from manufacturing and commercial facilities located in Oregon. The ODEQ has published a prioritization list of the facilities within the state subject to the CAO program based on emissions inventories that facilities submitted to the ODEQ. The prioritization list established four tiers of risk groups. Our steel mill has been assigned to the first-tier risk group and entered the CAO program in 2020. To comply with the existing CAO program rules, and as they may be revised in the future, we must undertake an emissions inventory and a public health risk assessment for both our steel mill and our Portland metals recycling facility. We may be required to incur additional operating or capital expenditures to mitigate any significant identified emissions risks, and such expenditures may be material. In addition, we have and continue to incur material capital expenditures to enclose and install additional emission controls for our shredders to meet air emission standards. Recent and future climate change and GHG laws or regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such requirements. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future laws or regulations becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, operating performance, or ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such laws or regulations, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the metals recycling and steel manufacturing industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our products. 
 Risk Factors Relating to Our Employees 
 Labor shortages or increased labor costs may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows 
 Our employees contribute to developing and meeting our business goals and objectives, and labor is a significant component of operating our business. The impact of labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees, unemployment levels and benefits, higher employee turnover rates, increases in the federally-mandated or state-mandated minimum wage, change in exempt and non-exempt status, or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage or workers compensation insurance), may increase our costs or impede our ability to operate our facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Recruiting and retaining employees in sufficient numbers to optimally staff our facilities may result in increases in our labor costs. 
 Reliance on employees subject to collective bargaining may restrict our ability to operate 
 Approximately 24 of our full-time employees are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements, including substantially all of the manufacturing employees at our steel manufacturing facility. As these agreements expire, we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements of such agreements on acceptable terms. Any failure to reach an agreement with one or more of our unions may result in strikes, lockouts, or other labor actions, including work slowdowns or stoppages, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 The underfunded status of our multiemployer pension plans may cause us to increase our contributions to the plans 
 As discussed in Note 13 - Employee Benefits in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, we contribute to the Steelworkers Western Independent Shops Pension Plan WISPP ), a multiemployer plan benefiting union employees of our steel mill. Because we have no current intention of withdrawing from the WISPP, we have not recognized a withdrawal liability in our consolidated financial statements. However, if such a liability were triggered, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. Our contributions to the WISPP could also increase as a result of a diminished contribution base due to the insolvency or withdrawal of other employers who currently contribute to it, the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liabilities, or other funding deficiencies, as we would need to fund the retirement obligations of these employers.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 Risk management and strategy 
 Our cybersecurity program has been designed to protect our organization's sensitive information, mitigate cyber threats, and ensure our critical assets confidentiality, integrity, and availability even as the threat landscape evolves. This is accomplished by a layered security approach through implementing security measures across various levels of our people, systems, and infrastructure with leading-edge cybersecurity tools combined with a 24/7 Security Operations Center and advanced vulnerability and incident management capabilities. Our safeguards also include employee training and awareness programs around phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity risks. 
 Cybersecurity is recognized as a top enterprise risk and the IT Risk Management ITRM program is an integral component of our enterprise risk management ERM program. Protection of the Company s informational assets is managed by a comprehensive, multi-layer strategy, modeled on the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST cybersecurity framework, and combines technology, services, policies, and user education to mitigate cyber risks. We have instituted Acceptable Use, Information Security, and Vendor Risk policies and procedures, which support our efforts to protect employees and contractors, while ensuring that we partner with responsible vendors who also invest in effective cybersecurity practices. Where appropriate, we engage external experts in different capacities to assist in our assessment, identification, and management of risks from cybersecurity threats. Our relationships with these external partners enable us to leverage their expertise to continually strengthen our programs and procedures. 
 Our ITRM program also includes processes to identify, assess and oversee risks presented by third parties, including vendors, service providers and other external users of our systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting those third-party systems. 
 In the event of a cybersecurity incident, we have an established incident response plan that requires prompt notification of the CEO and the Information Security and Privacy Executive Committee ISPEC ). The CEO and the ISPEC oversee the process for assessing the impacts of incidents, monitoring our mitigation and remediation efforts, and complying with any relevant laws and regulations. 
 To date, we have not identified any material risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any cybersecurity incident, which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, us, our business strategy, our results of operations, or our financial condition. As discussed more fully under Item 1A. Risk Factors , the sophistication of cyber threats continues to increase, and the preventative actions the Company takes to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect its systems and information may be insufficient. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, One or more cybersecurity incidents may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation above for more information. 
 Governance 
 Our Board of Directors has overall oversight responsibility for our ERM program, including oversight of cybersecurity risk management. The Board administers its risk oversight function through the full Board and its standing committees. The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that management has processes in place designed to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks and implement processes and programs to manage such risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. Management, including the Chief Information Officer CIO ), updates the Audit Committee on at least an annual basis regarding our cybersecurity programs and material cybersecurity risks and mitigation strategies. In addition, we have a standardized incident response process that establishes procedures for timely escalation and notification to the ISPEC and other members of senior management. 
 Our CIO, with oversight by the ISPEC, is responsible for managing the Company s digital infrastructure, systems, and services and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information stored and processed using those systems. Our CIO has more than 30 years of IT and cybersecurity experience and oversees a team of dedicated cybersecurity personnel with various experience and certifications in information security and cybersecurity. 
 Our internal compliance organization, through its involvement in the ISPEC, the Enterprise Compliance Counsel ECC and Internal Audit Department, works closely with our cybersecurity team in assessing and managing our cybersecurity risk. 
 The ISPEC provides comprehensive strategic guidance, coordination, and oversight of the Company s information security and privacy programs and governance, including the Cybersecurity Program, Data Privacy Program, Information Technology Policies, and data breach and cyber incident testing, plans, and operational response. The ISPEC meets quarterly and is co-chaired by the CIO and Assistant General Counsel, Legal, Chief Privacy Officer and Deputy Chief Compliance Officer. The ECC oversees key risk areas, which include IT and Cyber. The CIO is a key risk owner for the IT and cybersecurity domain and works with the ECC to effectively mitigate compliance risk within our functional regulatory area. This council meets quarterly and is chaired by the SVP General Counsel Chief Compliance Officer and Assistant General Counsel, Legal, Chief Privacy Officer and Deputy Chief Compliance Officer.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we are involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business involving normal and routine claims, including environmental compliance matters. Such proceedings include, but are not limited to, proceedings relating to our status as a potentially responsible party with respect to the Portland Harbor Superfund Site and proceedings relating to other legacy environmental issues. For additional information regarding such matters, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
 On February 23, 2021, the DTSC issued a corrective action enforcement order with respect to our metal recycling facility in Oakland, California that would require us to submit a current conditions report, to undertake a facilities investigation, risk assessment, a corrective measures study, and to implement corrective measures selected by the DTSC based on those assessments and studies. We dispute DTSC s alleged jurisdictional basis for the order, as well as the scope of work required by the order, which we believe is unwarranted and duplicative of ongoing assessments being conducted under the oversight of another state agency. We have filed a notice of defense that by law stays the effectiveness of the order and are challenging the order through the DTSC administrative process. 
 In addition, the DTSC issued a similar corrective action enforcement order on March 18, 2021 with respect to our metal recycling facility in Fresno, California based on inspections conducted by the DTSC in 2013. That 2013 inspection resulted in the issuance of a Summary of Violations in 2015 setting forth a number of alleged violations relating to hazardous waste management requirements. While we disputed the alleged violations, we engaged in settlement discussions that resulted in a tentative agreement in April 2018 to settle the matter for 490 thousand, of which 368 thousand was to be paid as a civil penalty and 122 thousand was to be paid as reimbursement for agency investigation and enforcement costs. However, the parties were not able to reach agreement on the injunctive terms of the settlement agreement, and the California Office of the Attorney General COAG ), on behalf of DTSC, filed suit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Fresno on June 25, 2020 against Schnitzer Fresno, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, which operates the facility, seeking a permanent injunction and civil penalties. Ultimately, this case was settled by entry of a Stipulated Judgment on January 18, 2023. The settlement terms include payment of a penalty of 525 thousand, specified injunctive relief requirements, and completion of site investigation and remediation requirements depending on the outcome of the investigation and risk assessment. 
 In January 2020, the USEPA issued a Notice of Violation NOV based on its evaluation of data requested during a June 2019 inspection at our facility in Oakland, California alleging the same violation of a Bay Area Air Quality Management District BAAQMD air emissions rule that was the subject of a Compliance and Settlement Agreement CSA with BAAQMD that was executed as of September 22, 2020 and also alleging violations of Title V Major Source permitting requirements based on source testing results of the recently enclosed shredder. The CSA required the installation of new emission controls for volatile organic compounds VOCs ), the payment of a civil penalty and excess emissions fees totaling 400 thousand, and the provision of certain VOC offsets. The Company timely filed an application for a Title V Major Source Permit and simultaneously filed an application for Synthetic Minor Operating Permit based on the proposed installation of Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers and acid gas scrubbers RTOs ). The Company maintains that the timely filing of a Title V Major Source permit application constitutes compliance with Title V Major Source rules and that USEPA s Title V non-compliance allegations are erroneous. The Company conveyed that position to USEPA and provided USEPA with documentation requested by USEPA confirming our position. The Company also advised USEPA that we had already submitted an application to the BAAQMD for an Authority to Construct the RTOs. To date, USEPA has taken no further action relating to the NOV. In addition, the Company has completed installation of new VOC emissions controls that have achieved compliance with the BAAQMD emissions rule and reduced emissions below applicable Title V thresholds. Accordingly, the Company does not believe that federal enforcement of the BAAQMD rule or Title V permitting requirements is warranted and believes this matter has been concluded. 
 On September 3, 2021, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality ODEQ issued a Pre-Enforcement Notice PEN alleging that the Company s metal shredder facility in Portland, Oregon was in violation of Title V of the federal Clean Air Act CAA ). In the PEN, ODEQ also alleged violations of major source new source review, CAO and federal hazardous air pollutant control technology requirements and gave notice to the Company that ODEQ had referred the matter to USEPA for review and possible formal enforcement. On April 25, 2022, the Company received an Information Request from USEPA, Region 10 under Section 114 of the CAA with respect to both the Portland shredder facility and the Tacoma metal shredder facility. The Company has responded to the Information Request. In our response, we identified why Title V does not apply to the Portland and Tacoma facilities, explained that we had submitted an application to ODEQ in December 2018 for an Air Contaminant Discharge Permit for the Portland facility with plant site emission limits that would limit emissions to less than Title V thresholds, noted that the Tacoma facility operates pursuant to an Order of Approval issued by the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency, described that we were proactively enclosing the shredders and installing particulate and

volatile organic compound controls at both facilities, and included information on the permit applications that had been submitted in connection with the enclosure and emission control projects. The Company does not believe that any enforcement action is warranted in this matter. ODEQ issued a separate information request for the Portland facility on December 8, 2022, and EPA transmitted a letter to the Company on December 20, 2022, indicating that ODEQ would assume lead agency status for potential enforcement. We responded to the ODEQ information request on January 12, 2023, and submitted additional information on April 13, 2023. On November 6, 2023, Radius and ODEQ signed a Mutual Agreement and Order MAO to resolve ODEQ s enforcement concerns, allow operation of the emission controls upon their November 2023 completion, describe the necessary steps for issuance of the facility air permit, define terms for later entry into the CAO toxics review program, and provide for a financial penalty of 100 thousand and contribution of 400 thousand to a supplemental environmental project. Accordingly, the Company believes this matter has been concluded. 
 On June 22, 2023, ODEQ issued two separate letters to the Company concerning the steel mill s Title V permit. In the first letter, ODEQ alleged violations related to fluoride and hydrogen fluoride emissions and also claimed a failure to fully implement a pollution prevention plan. The Company has filed a notice of contested case and is in discussions with ODEQ to resolve this matter. In the second letter, ODEQ notified the Company of its intent to reopen the steel mill s Title V permit to include a third-party contractor s emissions that has operated on a portion of the mill property for decades and to add a greenhouse gas plant site emissions limit compliance monitoring requirement to the Title V permit. The Company has contested ODEQ s actions and is in discussions to resolve this matter. 
 On August 5, 2020, The Athletics Investment Group LLC A s filed an action in the California Superior Court for the County of Alameda against the DTSC as Respondent and the Company as Real Party in Interest, seeking rescission of the f letter pursuant to which DTSC classified treated shredder waste from the Company s metal shredding facility in Oakland, California as a nonhazardous waste which among other things permits its use as alternative daily cover at municipal landfills. Pursuant to determinations under section 66260.200(f) of the state hazardous waste regulations issued in 1988 and 1989 (the f letters ), the DTSC determined that treated shredder waste from the Company s facility does not pose a significant hazard to human health, safety, or the environment. The Superior Court on April 16, 2021 issued an order and writ of mandate commanding the DTSC within 30 days to rescind the Company s f letters concluding that, under a law enacted by the legislature in 2014, the DTSC had a mandatory duty to rescind the f letters. The Superior Court reached this decision despite a determination by DTSC in 2018 pursuant to the 2014 statute reconfirming that treated shredder residue does not need to be managed as a hazardous waste in order to protect human health, safety, or the environment. Following the lifting of an initial stay of that order, DTSC rescinded the Company s f letters on November 29, 2021. As a result of the April 16, 2021 Superior Court order and subsequent orders by the same Superior Court, the Company at times was required to transport its shredder waste out of state for disposal at increased costs. The Company filed notices of appeal of the Superior Court's orders, and on September 30, 2022 the California State Court of Appeals, First Appellate District, Division Three reversed the April 16, 2021 Superior Court order, holding that the statute does not impose a mandatory duty on DTSC to rescind the Company s f letters and that DTSC could continue to regulate metal shredder waste through statutorily compliant f letters since DTSC s analysis confirmed this waste need not be classified as hazardous to protect human health and the environment. DTSC subsequently agreed to an alternative treatment standard for the shredder waste under an existing statutory exclusion, which allowed the Company to cease transporting its shredder waste out of state. Following the California Supreme Court s denial of review of the Court of Appeals decision, the Company immediately sought reinstatement of its f letters. On April 3, 2023, the Company received confirmation from DTSC that the f letters are in effect, subject to certain conditions. 
 On December 10, 2021, an emergency regulation CTMSR Regulation that allows metal shredding facilities to transport and dispose of treated shredder residue as non-hazardous waste under a conditional exclusion became effective, and the Company shipped treated shredder residue for use as alternative daily cover at municipal landfills in California from late December 2021 to September 7, 2022 when the emergency regulation expired. Following an inspection by the DTSC of the Company s Oakland metal shredding facility on May 16 and 17, 2022, the Company in its compilation and review of records requested by the DTSC during that inspection discovered and promptly self-disclosed to the DTSC that it is unable to confirm that it was in compliance with certain aspects of the CTMSR Regulation for certain periods since the adoption of the emergency regulation. The Company reported the corrective actions it has taken and the numerous detailed procedures that are now in place to prevent recurrence. The Company is confident that any failure to comply with the CTMSR Regulation did not pose a risk to human health or the environment. On August 31, 2022, the DTSC issued an Inspection Report detailing alleged violations including allegations that the Company treated and stored metal shredder residue without a permit or other grant of authorization in violation of the California Hazardous Waste Control Law HWCL ). The Company had previously discussed with DTSC the various forms of authorization that would satisfy the CTMSR Regulation and had promptly obtained a Permit by Rule under the HCWL which it understood to be a satisfactory option. In a September 14, 2022 letter, the Company responded in detail to the alleged violations setting forth the corrective actions it has taken including having obtained interim status authorization for the treatment and storage of metal shredder residue under the permitting provisions of the HCWL with a full reservation of rights. 
 On May 6, 2022, the A s filed an action in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda against the BAAQMD as Respondent and the Company as Real Party in Interest (the BAAQMD Case alleging that the BAAQMD has failed to properly regulate the Company s Oakland shredder facility under the federal and California Clean Air Acts and seeking an order requiring the

BAAQMD to revoke the Company s Permit to Operate for the Oakland facility. On June 3, 2022, the BAAQMD removed this action to the United States District Court, Northern District of California where the A s had previously filed an action against the Company on July 7, 2021 raising substantially similar issues under the federal Clean Air Act s citizen suit provision alleging violations by the Oakland facility of the federal Clean Air Act and permit conditions and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief (the CAA Case ). The A s recently disclosed that they were also seeking up to approximately 183 million in fines in the CAA Case, which claims the Company denies. The Company has vigorously defended against the claims asserted in the CAA Case, which is currently set for trial commencing November 12, 2024. The BAAQMD Case was remanded back to Alameda Superior Court on October 7, 2022, and no schedule has yet been established for that case. 
 On March 30, 2022, September 8, 2022, and July 31, 2023, the Company received letters from the COAG alleging violations of the Stipulation for Entry of Final Judgment and Order on Consent Consent Order issued by the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda in February 2021 that was entered into with the Alameda County District Attorney, DTSC and COAG to settle certain alleged violations of environmental requirements at our Oakland metals recycling facility. The letters demand that the Company take additional measures to address the off-site release and deposition of light fibrous material LFM ). The Company does not believe that it is in violation of the Consent Order and has detailed the additional control measures that the Company has implemented and continues to implement to reduce the potential for releases of LFM from its Oakland facility. The Company is in continuing discussions with the COAG, the Alameda County District Attorney s office, and DTSC regarding this matter and does not believe that further enforcement action is warranted. To date, no formal action has been taken to enforce the Consent Order. 
 In January 2024, the BAAQMD notified the Company that it wished to enter into a settlement agreement with the Company relating to certain start-up issues associated with the RTOs at our Oakland metal recycling facility. The scope of the proposed settlement was subsequently expanded to include certain alleged violations of vapor control requirements at one of the Company s auto dismantling facilities in the Bay Area. The Company disputes certain of the alleged violations but is in discussion with the BAAMQD in an effort to settle the matter. Effective as of October 16, 2024, the Company and the BAAQMD resolved this matter upon the Company s agreement to pay a civil penalty in the amount of 575 thousand. 
 On April 26, 2024, the Company received a letter from the COAG summarizing a number of alleged violations of the state hazardous waste regulations at our metal recycling facility in Oakland, which arose out of an inspection by DTSC in May 2022. The COAG s letter also alleged violations of the hazardous waste regulation in conjunction with certain fires that occurred at the facility in 2018, 2020 and 2023. The Company disputes many of the alleged violations but is in discussion with DTSC and COAG regarding settlement of the alleged violations, other than those relating to the fires. Such settlement is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of the alleged violations relating to fires has been deferred pending resolution of the Alameda County Criminal Grand Jury matter described below. 
 On June 28, 2024, the Alameda County Criminal Grand Jury returned an indictment against the Company and two operations employees alleging felony and misdemeanor environmental regulatory violations for mishandling hazardous waste, including destruction of evidence, arising from the August 2023 scrap metal fire at the Company s Oakland, CA facility and the Company s subsequent shredding of the burned material. The indictment alleges that the post-fire shredding of burned material constituted destruction of evidence. The Company disputes the allegations. The Company asserts that it does not store or treat hazardous waste and did not destroy any evidence. The District Attorney s office was at the Company s facility the day the fire was extinguished, along with representatives from the DTSC, the BAAQMD and other state and federal regulatory agencies, and they found no evidence of hazardous waste. All regulators were permitted to inspect the burned scrap metal and other fire debris and take photographs and samples. The Company advised all regulators that they would start shredding the burned material later that day to eliminate any risk of further fire consistent with safety protocol and industry practice. Neither the Alameda County District Attorney nor any other regulator objected to the processing of the burned material. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in connection with these allegations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 This section includes a discussion of our operations for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. The following discussion and analysis provide information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
 For discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2022 including comparison to fiscal 2023, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. 
 Business 
 Founded in 1906, Radius Recycling is one of North America s largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products. As a vertically integrated organization, we offer a range of products and services to meet global demand through our network that includes 50 retail self-service auto parts stores, 53 metals recycling facilities, and an electric arc furnace EAF steel mill. Our internal organizational and reporting structure includes a single operating and reportable segment. 
 We sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in both foreign and domestic markets. We also sell a range of finished steel long products produced at our steel mill. Our results of operations depend in large part on the demand and prices for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and on the supply of raw materials, including end-of-life vehicles, available to be processed at our facilities. Our results of operations also depend substantially on our operating leverage from processing and selling higher volumes of recycled metal as well as our ability to efficiently extract ferrous and nonferrous metals from the shredding process. We respond to changes in selling prices for processed metal by seeking to adjust purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal in order to manage the impact on our operating results. We believe we generally benefit from sustained periods of stable or rising recycled metal selling prices, which allow us to better maintain or increase both operating results and unprocessed scrap metal flow into our facilities. When recycled metal selling prices decline, either sharply or for a sustained period, our operating margins typically compress. With respect to finished steel products produced at our steel mill, our results of operations are impacted by demand and prices for these products, which are sold to customers located primarily in the Western U.S. and Western Canada. 
 Our quarterly operating results fluctuate based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, changes in market conditions for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal and finished steel products, the supply of scrap metal in our domestic markets, and varying demand for used auto parts from our self-service retail stores. Certain of these factors are influenced, to a degree, by the impact of seasonal changes including severe weather conditions, which can impact the timing of shipments and inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal collection and production levels at our facilities, and retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores. Further, sanctions, trade actions, and licensing and inspection requirements can impact the level of profitability on sales of our products and, in certain cases, impede or restrict our ability to sell to certain export markets or require us to direct our sales to alternative market destinations, which can cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.

Strategic Priorities 
 As we continue to closely monitor economic conditions, we remain focused on the following core strategies and plans to meet our business goals and objectives: 
 Long-term expansion of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal supply and processing, sales volumes, and operating margins; 

Manufacturing and information technology investments and process improvements to increase the separation and recovery of metal materials from our shredding process, expand product optionality, enable volume growth, increase efficiency, and expand recycling services; 

Development of new products and use of our core competencies in adjacent recycling businesses to expand recycling services and capabilities to reach a broader market, enhance customer value, and increase operating margins; 

Increase market share through initiatives to maximize volumes and through selective partnerships, alliances, and acquisitions; 

Productivity and continuous improvement initiatives to ensure the safety of our employees, increase operating efficiency and effectiveness, advance sustainable business practices, improve natural resource stewardship, and reduce operating expense; 

Use of our seven deepwater ports and ground-based logistics network to directly access customers domestically and internationally to meet demand for our products wherever it is greatest; and 

Further optimization of our integrated recycling and steel manufacturing operating platforms to maximize opportunities for synergies, cost efficiencies, and volumes. 

Key economic factors and trends affecting the industries in which we operate 
 We sell recycled metals to the global steel industry for the production of finished steel. Our financial results largely depend on supply of raw materials in the U.S. and Western Canada and demand for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and for finished steel products in the Western U.S. and Western Canada. Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the economic cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and nonresidential and infrastructure construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. Global economic conditions, including impacts of geopolitical instability, structural and cyclical changes in supply and demand conditions, inflation, changes in interest rates, the strength of the U.S. dollar, the availability and price of raw material alternatives, and trade actions such as tariffs affect market prices for and sales volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and steel products in the Western U.S. and Western Canada and can have a significant impact on the results of our operations. 
 Market conditions and net selling prices for recycled ferrous metals globally were weaker in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year driven by weaker demand primarily from slower global growth, elevated levels of Chinese steel exports, inflationary pressure including increased scrap collection and other operating costs, and high interest rates. The slowdown in economic activity, including due to higher interest rates, that began substantially in the second half of fiscal 2022 and persisted throughout fiscal 2023 and 2024 led to reduced generation of scrap metal in the U.S. domestic market and increased competition for available scrap volumes. The tight supply flows in combination with the lower price environment for recycled metals put significant pressure on metals spreads in fiscal 2023 and 2024, causing operating margin compression. 
 Market conditions for recycled nonferrous metals diverged from those for ferrous, with nonferrous demand and prices strengthening in the second half of fiscal 2024, except for selling prices for platinum group metals (PGMs) included in catalytic converters which declined significantly year-over-year. Our continued investment in nonferrous metal recovery technologies designed to increase metal recovery and the volume of nonferrous material from shredding operations is an important driver for the targeted improvement of our operating profit. 
 Average net selling prices for our finished steel products decreased compared to fiscal 2023 and the record-high levels reached in fiscal 2022 due to softer non-residential construction demand in our West Coast markets, including as a result of the higher interest rate environment, but remained at relatively high historical levels. 
 We continue to believe decarbonization efforts by companies, industries, and governments around the world, including investments in low carbon technologies such as renewable energies, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency solutions that are more metal intensive and minimize carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels, among other factors, support global long-term demand for our recycled metal products.

Steel Mill Fire 
 On May 22, 2021, we experienced a fire at our steel mill in McMinnville, Oregon. Direct physical loss or damage to property from the incident was limited to the mill s melt shop, with no bodily injuries and no physical loss or damage to other buildings or equipment. We experienced loss of business income during the shutdown of the steel mill and the subsequent ramp-up phase which was substantially completed in fiscal 2022. We have insurance that was fully applicable to the losses and filed insurance claims, which were subject to deductibles and various conditions, exclusions, and limits, for the property that experienced physical loss or damage and business income losses resulting from the matter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we reached a full and final settlement with our insurers for our claims. All insurance proceeds and recovery gains in connection with our claims had been received and recognized, respectively, as of August 31, 2023. We recognized a total of 52 million of insurance recovery gains within cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in connection with this event, of which 27 million and 15 million was recognized in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting recovery of applicable losses including business income losses incurred as a result of the fire. 
 Everett Facility Shredder Fire 
 On December 8, 2021, we experienced a fire at our metals recycling facility in Everett, Massachusetts. Direct physical loss or damage to property from the incident was limited to the facility s shredder building and equipment, with no bodily injuries and no physical loss or damage to property reported at other buildings or equipment. As a result of the fire, shredding operations ceased, while all non-shredding operations at the facility continued, including torching, shearing, separating, and sorting purchased non-shreddable recycled ferrous metals. On January 28, 2022, shredding operations at the facility began ramping up following the replacement of and repairs to shredder equipment that had been damaged. In addition, shredding operations temporarily ceased at the facility on June 18, 2022 and, following discussions with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the Massachusetts Attorney General s office, we installed a temporary emission capture system and controls that allowed for us to resume shredding operations on November 11, 2022 and for continued operation during the repair and replacement of the shredder enclosure building. Non-shredding operations at the facility continued during this period. The repair and replacement of most property that experienced physical loss or damage, primarily buildings and improvements, was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2023. We have insurance that was fully applicable to the losses, including but not limited to the costs of installing the temporary capture and controls system and any associated loss of business income, and filed insurance claims, which were subject to deductibles and various conditions, exclusions, and limits, for the property damage or loss and business income losses resulting from the matter. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we reached a full and final settlement with our insurers for our claims. All insurance proceeds and recovery gains in connection with our claims had been received and recognized, respectively, as of August 31, 2024. We recognized a total of 47 million of insurance recovery gains within cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in connection with this event, of which 14 million, 16 million and 17 million was recognized in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, reflecting recovery of applicable losses including business income losses incurred as a result of the fire. 
 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In this management s discussion and analysis, we use supplemental measures of our performance, liquidity, and capital structure which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing these non-GAAP financial measures adds a meaningful presentation of our operating and financial performance, liquidity, and capital structure. For example, we use adjusted EBITDA as one of the measures to compare and evaluate financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the sum of our net income before results from discontinued operations, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, goodwill impairment charges, restructuring charges and other exit-related activities, other asset impairment charges, charges for legacy environmental matters (net of recoveries), amortization of capitalized cloud computing implementation costs, business development costs not related to ongoing operations including pre-acquisition expenses, charges related to non-ordinary course legal settlements, and other items which are not related to underlying business operational performance. See the reconciliations of supplemental financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7. 
 Our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Although we find these non-GAAP financial measures useful in evaluating the performance of our business, our reliance on these measures is limited because they often materially differ from our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, we typically use these adjusted amounts in conjunction with our GAAP results to address these limitations. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

 Diluted loss per share from continuing operations attributable to Radius shareholders in fiscal 2024 was 9.37, which included a goodwill impairment charge of 216 million or 6.41 per share, net of tax. Diluted loss per share was 0.92 in the prior fiscal year. 

Adjusted diluted loss per share from continuing operations attributable to Radius shareholders in fiscal 2024 was 2.68, compared to earnings per share of 0.85 in the prior fiscal year. 

Net loss in fiscal 2024 was 266 million, compared to 25 million in the prior fiscal year. 

Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2024 was 29 million, compared to 144 million in the prior fiscal year. 

Market conditions for recycled metals and finished steel were weaker in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year, leading to lower average ferrous and finished steel net selling prices and a significant compression in metal spreads. The average net selling prices for our ferrous products decreased by 4 as a result of weaker global demand, due in part to elevated levels of Chinese steel exports. Ferrous sales volumes increased 3 compared to the prior year, including increased volumes associated with recycling services. The average net selling prices for our nonferrous products increased 4 on robust global demand, and sales volumes were 1 higher compared to the prior fiscal year. Average net selling prices for our finished steel products decreased by 12 compared to the prior fiscal year due to softer non-residential construction demand in our West Coast markets which, combined with purchase costs for raw materials staying relatively consistent, led to a significant margin compression. Our results in fiscal 2024 reflected the continued unfavorable impact of tight supply flows of ferrous scrap metal due to lower prices and manufacturing activity, significantly lower year-over-year PGM prices, and inflationary pressure on operating costs. Contributions from productivity and cost reduction initiatives identified and commenced in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 helped to offset the continued effects of inflationary pressure on operating costs. In addition, fiscal 2023 results benefited from 30 million higher insurance recovery gains related to the steel mill fire and the Everett facility shredder fire that occurred in prior periods. 
 In fiscal 2024, based on financial and operational performance factors and the sustained decrease in our market capitalization, we identified a triggering event requiring the performance of a quantitative goodwill impairment test as of May 1, 2024 which resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 216 million. 
 SG A expense in fiscal 2024 decreased 7 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily reflecting benefits from cost reduction measures implemented in the current fiscal year which more than offset the impact of inflation and higher costs related to technology investments and certain legal matters. 
 The following items further highlight selected liquidity and capital structure metrics: 
 Net cash used in operating activities of 53 million in fiscal 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities of 139 million in the prior fiscal year. 

Debt was 415 million as of August 31, 2024, compared to 249 million as of August 31, 2023. 

Debt, net of cash, was 409 million as of August 31, 2024, compared to 243 million as of August 31, 2023.

Revenues 
 Revenues in fiscal 2024 decreased by 5 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and finished steel products driven by weaker market conditions. Market conditions for recycled ferrous metals and finished steel were weaker in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year, leading to lower average ferrous and finished steel net selling prices. The average net selling prices for our ferrous products decreased by 4 as a result of weaker demand, due in part to elevated levels of Chinese steel exports. Ferrous sales volumes increased 3 in fiscal 2024 compared to 2023, partially due to the adverse impact of operational disruptions in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Global nonferrous demand strengthened through the second half of fiscal 2024, leading to a 4 increase in average net selling prices for our nonferrous products compared to the prior fiscal year. Our nonferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2024 increased by 1 compared to the prior year. The benefit of increased selling prices and volumes on our nonferrous revenue was more than offset by significantly lower PGM prices and volumes in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. Market conditions for our finished steel products were softer in fiscal 2024, leading to finished steel average selling prices decreasing 12 , compared to higher prices in the prior fiscal year. Finished steel sales volumes decreased 2 in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year. 
 Operating Performance 
 The combination of goodwill impairment charges, significantly lower year-over-year finished steel prices, ferrous metal spread compression due to weaker market conditions, higher production and other operating costs, and a lower benefit from insurance recoveries in the current fiscal year had a significant adverse impact on our operating margins, net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA. Net loss in fiscal 2024 was 266 million, compared to net loss of 25 million in the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2024 was 29 million, compared to 144 million in the prior fiscal year. Contributions from productivity and cost reduction initiatives identified and commenced in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 helped to offset the continued effects of inflationary pressure on operating costs. Our results in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 included 14 million and 43 million, respectively, in insurance recovery gains associated with the resolution of property damage and business interruption claims related to the steel mill fire and the Everett facility shredder fire that occurred in prior periods. 
 Starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we achieved the full quarterly run rate of the targeted annual benefits of 60 million associated with our productivity and cost reduction initiatives introduced in fiscal 2023. In addition, during fiscal 2024, we began implementing incremental productivity and cost reduction initiatives with an aggregate targeted annual benefit of approximately 70 million. These fiscal 2024 initiatives included a combination of increased yields, efficiencies in processing, transportation and procurement, and reduced costs including from headcount reductions and a targeted reduction of SG A expense by 10 . In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we achieved substantially the full quarterly run rate of the targeted annual benefits associated with our fiscal 2024 initiatives. Contributions from these productivity and cost reduction initiatives helped to offset the effects of inflationary pressure and increases in operating costs. During fiscal 2024, we incurred 7 million of restructuring charges and other exit-related costs in connection with these plans, compared to 3 million in fiscal 2023. 
 SG A expense in fiscal 2024 decreased by 7 compared to the prior fiscal year reflecting benefits from cost reduction measures implemented during fiscal 2024, lower incentive compensation due to Company performance, and lower legacy environmental charges, partially offset by higher outside and professional services expenses, due in part to higher costs for legal matters and the impact of inflation. 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, based on financial and operational performance factors and the sustained decrease in our market capitalization, we identified a triggering event requiring the performance of a quantitative goodwill impairment test as of May 1, 2024 which resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 216 million, representing the full carrying amount of goodwill allocated to three of our reporting units. The remaining 13 million of goodwill, which is carried by one reporting unit, a recycling services operation, was deemed not to be impaired. In fiscal 2023 we recorded 51 million in goodwill and other asset impairment charges. See further discussion in the Critical Accounting Estimates section at the end of Part II, Item 7 and Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 27 million, 19 million, and 9 million as of August 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased average borrowings as well as higher interest rates on amounts outstanding under our bank credit facilities, compared to the prior fiscal year.

Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was a benefit on pre-tax loss of 17.2 and 9.8 . Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2024 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the effect of permanent differences from non-deductible goodwill and the recognition of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the Company s U.S. federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the aggregate effect of the relatively low absolute level of pre-tax earnings, permanent differences from non-deductible expenses, and unrecognized tax benefits. 
 The goodwill impairment charge recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 led to a significant increase in our deferred tax assets, and as a result, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences as a source of income does not support the full realization of our deferred tax assets. In fiscal 2024 we determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with certain of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and recorded a 14 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in our U.S. federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change. We continue to maintain valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions as a result of negative evidence, including historical losses in these jurisdictions, which indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the associated tax benefit will not be realized. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We rely on cash provided by operating activities as a primary source of liquidity, supplemented by current cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 We had cash balances of 6 million as of both August 31, 2024 and 2023. Cash balances are intended to be used primarily for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments, and acquisitions. We use excess cash on hand to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. As of August 31, 2024, debt was 415 million, compared to 249 million as of August 31, 2023. Debt, net of cash, was 409 million as of August 31, 2024, compared to 243 million as of August 31, 2023. The increase in debt was primarily due to increased borrowings from our credit facilities mainly to fund working capital needs and capital expenditures. See the reconciliation of debt, net of cash, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2024 was 53 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of 139 million in fiscal 2023. 
 Sources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2024 included a 17 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to changes in the timing of payment of premiums under various insurance policies. Uses of cash in fiscal 2024 included a 60 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of sales and collections and a 10 million decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to decreased incentive compensation liabilities. 
 Sources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2023 included a 48 million decrease in inventories primarily due to lower raw material purchase costs and the timing of purchases and sales and a 12 million decrease in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of sales and collections. Uses of cash in fiscal 2023 included a 24 million decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to decreased incentive compensation liabilities and a 14 million decrease in accrued liabilities due in part to recognition

through fiscal 2023 earnings of advance payments received from insurers in excess of recoveries as of the end of fiscal 2022 upon full and final settlement with our insurers for our claims arising from the May 2021 steel mill fire. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2024 was 79 million, compared to 144 million in fiscal 2023. 
 Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2024 included capital expenditures of 76 million to upgrade our equipment and infrastructure and for investments in advanced metals recovery technology and environmental and safety-related assets, compared to 130 million in the prior fiscal year. 
 Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 included 25 million paid to acquire the assets of the ScrapSource business on November 18, 2022. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. See Note 7 - Business Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail. Cash flows from investing activities in fiscal 2023 included proceeds of 8 million representing the portion of advance payments from insurers deemed a recovery of capital purchases incurred for repair and replacement of damaged property arising from the December 2021 Everett facility shredder fire. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2024 was 131 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 33 million in fiscal 2023. 
 Cash flows from financing activities in fiscal 2024 included 161 million in net borrowings of debt compared to 3 million in net repayment of debt in the prior fiscal year (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7). Uses of cash in fiscal 2024 and 2023 included 5 million and 8 million, respectively, for payment of employee tax withholdings resulting from settlement of share-based awards and 22 million and 21 million, respectively, in each fiscal year for the payment of dividends.

Our senior secured revolving credit facilities provide for revolving loans of 800 million and C 15 million, which mature in August 2027. On June 17, 2024, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into the Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2016, by and among the Company, as the U.S. Borrower, Schnitzer Steel Canada, Ltd., as the Canadian Borrower, the subsidiaries of the Company party thereto (the Guarantors ), Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (as amended prior to the Fourth Amendment, the Existing Credit Agreement , the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Amended Credit Agreement ). The principal changes to the Existing Credit Agreement effected by the Fourth Amendment are (i) the removal of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the fiscal quarters ending May 31, 2024 through February 28, 2025, (ii) the introduction of a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending May 31, 2024, and 1.25 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending February 28, 2025, and (iii) the introduction of a minimum consolidated asset coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 for each of the fiscal quarters ending May 31, 2024 through February 28, 2025. 
 The Fourth Amendment also revised the applicable interest rates under the facility which, starting June 17, 2024, are based, at our option, on either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR (or the Term Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average CORRA for C loans), plus a spread of between 1.50 and 2.50 , with the amount of the spread based on a pricing grid tied to our ratio of consolidated net funded debt to EBITDA (as defined by the credit agreement), or the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 or (c) the daily rate equal to Term SOFR plus 1.00 , in each case, plus a spread of between 0.50 and 1.50 based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated net funded debt to EBITDA ratio. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the credit facilities at rates between 0.175 and 0.350 based on a pricing grid tied to our ratio of consolidated net funded debt to EBITDA.

Our obligations under our credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. The credit facilities and the related guarantees are secured by senior first priority liens on certain of our and our subsidiaries assets, including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. The Fourth Amendment expanded the collateral package provided to the lenders to include most other personal property and equity interests held by the Company and the Guarantors in their respective subsidiaries. 
 We had borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities of 394 million and 230 million as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facilities was 8.0 and 7.2 as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into three interest rate swap transactions to hedge the variability in interest cash flows associated with our variable-rate loans under our credit facilities. The interest rate swaps require us to make fixed-rate payments based on a total notional amount of 150 million and an average annual rate of approximately 4.40 in exchange for the receipt of variable-rate amounts over a three-year term ending in August 2026. See Note 15 - Derivative Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this report for disclosure related to derivative instruments and hedging activities. 
 We use the credit facilities to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments, and acquisitions. Our credit agreement contains various representations and warranties, events of default, and financial and other customary covenants which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates, and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. The financial covenants under the credit agreement include (a) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the four-quarter rolling sum of consolidated EBITDA less defined maintenance capital expenditures and certain environmental expenditures divided by consolidated fixed charges which, for the fiscal quarters ending May 31, 2024 through February 28, 2025, has been replaced with maintenance covenants during that period requiring compliance with a minimum permitted interest coverage ratio and a minimum permitted asset coverage ratio as per the Fourth Amendment as described above, and (b) a consolidated leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded indebtedness divided by the sum of consolidated net worth and consolidated funded indebtedness. 
 As of August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants under our credit agreement. The consolidated asset coverage ratio was required to be no less than 1.00 to 1.00 and was 1.33 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2024. The consolidated leverage ratio was required to be no more than 0.55 to 1.00 and was 0.40 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2024. 
 While we expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement, we may not be able to do so in the event market conditions do not improve, or other factors have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. If we do not maintain compliance with our financial covenants and are unable to obtain an amendment or waiver from our lenders, a breach of a financial covenant would constitute an event of default and allow the lenders to exercise remedies under the agreements, the most severe of which is the termination of the credit facility under our committed bank credit agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed under the agreement. In such case, we would be required to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain alternative funds. We cannot assure that any such alternative funds, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms. 
 Other debt obligations, which totaled 12 million as of both August 31, 2024 and 2023, primarily relate to equipment purchases, the contract consideration for which includes an obligation to make future monthly payments to the vendor in the form of licensing fees. For accounting purposes, such obligations are treated as a partial financing of the purchase price by the equipment vendor. Monthly payments commence when the equipment is placed in service and achieves specified minimum operating metrics, with payments continuing for a period of four years thereafter. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures totaled 76 million for fiscal 2024, compared to 130 million for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures included approximately 19 million and 33 million for investments in growth in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. We currently plan to invest in the range of 80 million to 90 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2025. These capital expenditures include investments in growth, including new nonferrous processing technologies, and to support growth in recycling services and other volume initiatives, and investments to upgrade our equipment, infrastructure, and information technology systems, and for environmental and safety-related assets, using cash generated from operations and available credit facilities. Supply chain disruptions have contributed to some delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital projects, and to the time required to obtain permits from government agencies, resulting in the deferral of certain capital expenditures. Given the continually evolving nature of such disruptions and other factors impacting the timing of project completion, the extent to which forecasted capital expenditures could be deferred is uncertain.

 RADIUS RECYCLING, INC. 

Environmental Compliance 
 Building on our commitment to recycling and operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner, we continue to invest in facilities that improve our environmental presence in the communities in which we operate. As part of our capital expenditures discussed in the prior paragraph, we invested approximately 21 million in capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal 2024, and we currently plan to invest in the range of 30 million to 40 million for such projects in fiscal 2025. These projects include investments in equipment to ensure ongoing compliance with air quality and other environmental regulations and storm water systems. 
 We have been identified by the EPA as one of the potentially responsible parties that own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site Portland Harbor ). See Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of this matter, as well as other legacy environmental loss contingencies. We believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely to or which it is reasonably possible that we will incur in connection with Portland Harbor, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We have insurance policies and QSFs that we believe will provide reimbursement for costs we incur for defense, remediation, and mitigation for natural resource damages claims in connection with Portland Harbor, although there are no assurances that those policies and the QSFs will cover all of the costs which we may incur. Significant cash outflows in the future related to Portland Harbor, as well as related to other legacy environmental loss contingencies, could reduce the amounts available for borrowing that could otherwise be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments, and acquisitions and could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements, and could adversely impact our liquidity. 
 Dividends 
 On July 2, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 of 0.1875 per common share, which equates to an annual cash dividend of 0.75 per common share. Dividends of 0.75 per common share, totaling 22 million, were declared and paid during fiscal 2024, and 21 million in dividends were also declared and paid during fiscal 2023. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal 2024 and 2023. For information regarding share repurchases during fiscal 2022, see Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities above in Part II of this report, incorporated by reference herein. 
 Assessment of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Historically, our available cash resources, internally generated funds, credit facilities, and equity offerings have financed our acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, and other financing needs. As of August 31, 2024, we have entered into contracts to sell certain discrete real estate assets that are projected to generate net cash proceeds in excess of 35 million upon consummation of the transactions, which we expect will occur during the second half of fiscal 2025, subject to customary terms and conditions. These real estate sale transactions will not meaningfully modify our operating footprint. 
 We generally believe our current cash resources, internally generated funds, existing credit facilities, and access to the capital markets will provide adequate short-term and long-term liquidity needs for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, investments and acquisitions, joint ventures, debt service requirements, environmental obligations, share repurchases, and other contingencies. However, in the event market conditions fail to improve, we are unable to realize the benefits of our operational and cost savings initiatives, or other negative factors occur, we may need additional liquidity which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds. There can be no assurances that any such supplemental funding, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.

(1) Credit facilities include the principal amount of borrowings outstanding under bank secured revolving credit facilities, which mature in August 2027. 

(2) Interest payments on credit facilities are based on interest rates in effect as of August 31, 2024, including the effect of interest rate swaps. As contractual interest rates and the amount of debt outstanding is variable in certain cases, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided. 

(3) Other debt obligations primarily relate to equipment purchases, the contract consideration for which includes an obligation to make future monthly payments to the vendor in the form of licensing fees. For accounting purposes, such obligation is treated as a partial financing of the purchase price by the equipment vendor. Monthly payments commence when the equipment is placed in service and continue for a period of four years thereafter. 

(4) Operating lease payments reflect those embedded in the measurement of our operating lease liabilities and, thus, include future lease payments for the remaining non-cancellable period of the lease together with periods covered by renewal (or termination) options which we are reasonably certain to exercise (or not to exercise). These operating lease payments do not include certain tax, insurance, and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. Also, we have excluded future minimum lease payments for leases that have been executed but have not commenced as of August 31, 2024. 

In addition to future obligations related to debt and leases presented in the table above, we have certain material cash requirements, including but not limited to commitments for capital expenditures. See Capital Expenditures within Liquidity and Capital Resources above in this Item 7 for discussion of our planned investment in capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, a portion of which represents contractual commitments that existed as of the end of our fiscal 2024. We also had open purchase orders as of August 31, 2024 for purchases of primarily fuels and lubricants, machinery and equipment components and parts, and consumables used in our operations of approximately 89 million, nearly all of which require payment of cash in our fiscal 2025. 
 In fiscal 2023, we entered three interest rate swap transactions to hedge the variability in interest cash flows associated with our variable-rate loans under our credit facilities. The interest rate swaps require us to make fixed-rate payments based on a total notional amount of 150 million and an average annual rate of approximately 4.40 in exchange for the receipt of variable-rate amounts over a three-year term ending in August 2026. See Note 15 - Derivative Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this report for disclosure related to derivative instruments and hedging activities. 
 See Note 13 - Employee Benefits in Part II, Item 8 of this report for disclosure related to qualified and nonqualified retirement plans, which include a defined benefit pension plan, a supplemental executive retirement benefit plan, multiemployer pension plans, defined contribution plans, and a deferred compensation plan. 
 We maintain stand-by letters of credit to provide support for certain obligations, including workers compensation and performance bonds. As of August 31, 2024, we had 7 million outstanding under these arrangements.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. An accounting estimate is deemed to be critical if it is made based on assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. 
 Our critical accounting estimates include those related to inventories, goodwill, business acquisitions, long-lived assets, environmental costs, and income taxes. 
 Inventories 
 Our inventories consist of processed and unprocessed scrap metal (ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed nonferrous recovered joint products arising from the manufacturing process), semi-finished steel products (billets), finished steel products (primarily rebar, wire rod, and merchant bar), used and salvaged vehicles, and supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We consider estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value of our inventory. As we generally sell our recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed, we utilize the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated net realizable value of quantities on hand that will be shipped under these contracts and sales orders. 
 The accounting process we use to record ferrous scrap metal quantities relies on significant estimates. With respect to estimating the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal inventory that are moved into production, we rely on weighed quantities of the processed ferrous material, adjusted for estimated metal recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and other judgments by management. Actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content, and the source of the unprocessed metal. The Company s estimates are intended to reasonably reflect the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal that are used in the production of processed ferrous metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates, we periodically review shrink factors and perform monthly physical inventories. Due to the inherent nature of our scrap metal inventories, including variations in product density, holding period, and production processes utilized to manufacture the products, physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances for scrap metal inventory such that estimates of quantities are required. To mitigate this risk, we further adjust our ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count is deemed to more accurately estimate the remaining volume. 
 Goodwill 
 We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component ). 
 When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more-likely-than-not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. When performing the quantitative impairment test, we apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
 Our quantitative impairment assessment considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit s fair value. Assumptions primarily include revenue growth rates driven by future ferrous and nonferrous commodity price and sales volume expectations, gross margins, selling, general and administrative expense relative to total revenues, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, discount rates based on a reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital WACC ), tax rate, terminal growth rate, benefits associated with a taxable transaction, and synergistic benefits available to market participants. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. These estimates change from period to period based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors and could materially affect the determination of the fair value and potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Our quantitative assessment is sensitive to changes in underlying estimates and assumptions including the level of margin recovery, the discount rate and terminal growth rate.

Table of Contents 
 RADIUS RECYCLING, INC. 

In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we identified a triggering event that indicated that the goodwill allocated to certain of our reporting units may be impaired. For the two metals recycling reporting units and the autos reporting unit subject to the quantitative impairment test, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, resulting in full impairment of the allocated goodwill and an aggregate impairment charge of 216 million. 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2024. As of the testing date, the balance of our goodwill was 13 million, which was allocated to one reporting unit, a recycling services operation. We elected to perform the qualitative assessment for this reporting unit and concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of the testing date, and, therefore, no further impairment testing was required. 
 See Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail. 
 Business Acquisitions 
 We recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. Contingent purchase consideration is recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Within one year from the date of acquisition, we may update the value allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the resulting goodwill balance, based on information received regarding the valuation of such assets and liabilities that was not available at the time of purchase. Measuring assets and liabilities at fair value requires us to determine the price that would be paid by a third-party market participant based on the highest and best use of the assets or interests acquired. See Note 7 - Business Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for disclosure of our acquisition of the Columbus Recycling business on October 1, 2021, our acquisition of the Encore Recycling business on April 29, 2022, and our acquisition of the ScrapSource business on November 18, 2022. 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 We test long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment at the asset group level, which is determined based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. We test our asset groups for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired. If the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable because it exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized by the amount the carrying value exceeds its fair value, if any. The impairment loss is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. Fair value is determined using one or more of the income, market, or cost approaches, depending on the nature of the asset group. Determination of fair value is considered a critical accounting estimate. In fiscal 2024, we did not identify any triggering events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of a material asset group may be impaired. 
 Environmental Costs 
 We operate in industries that inherently possess environmental risks. To manage these risks, we employ both our own environmental staff and outside consultants. Environmental management and finance personnel meet regularly to discuss environmental risks. We estimate future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrue for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated but the timing of incurring the estimated costs is unknown. The regulatory and government management of these projects is complex, which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than any other, the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements. If further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these liabilities, the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated. Adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which accruals are established are made. The factors we consider in the recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include: 
 Current regulations, both at the time the liability is established and during the course of the investigation or remediation process, which specify standards for acceptable remediation; 

Information about the site which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated; 

The professional judgment of senior level internal staff and outside consultants, who take into account similar, recent instances of environmental remediation issues, and studies of our sites, among other considerations; 

45 / Radius Recycling, Inc. Form 10-K Fiscal 2024 

Table of Contents 
 RADIUS RECYCLING, INC. 

Available technologies that can be used for remediation; and 

The number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the costs of study and remediation. 

Our accrued environmental liabilities as of August 31, 2024 included 8 million related to the Portland Harbor Superfund site. Because the final remedial actions have not yet been designed and there has not been a final determination of the amount of natural resource damages or of the allocation among the potentially responsible parties of costs of the investigations, or remedial action costs, we believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely or which it is reasonably possible that we may incur in connection with Portland Harbor, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Therefore, no additional amounts have been accrued. Further, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party at sites other than Portland Harbor which are currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other sites where we may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities. See Contingencies Environmental in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
 Income Taxes 
 Valuation Allowances 
 We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. We consider all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. Due to the significant judgment involved, realizability of our deferred tax assets is considered a critical accounting estimate. We maintain valuation allowances against certain U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the associated tax jurisdictions in future years to benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences. Changes in historical earnings performance and future earnings projections, among other factors, may cause us to adjust our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which would impact our results of operations in the period we determine that these factors have changed. See Valuation Allowances in Note 16 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 For a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Debt, net of cash 
 Debt, net of cash is the difference between (i) the sum of long-term debt and short-term borrowings (i.e., total debt) and (ii) cash and cash equivalents. We believe that presenting debt, net of cash is useful to investors as a measure of our leverage, as cash and cash equivalents can be used, among other things, to repay indebtedness.

 RADIUS RECYCLING, INC. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to commodity price risk, mainly associated with variations in the market price for ferrous and nonferrous metals, including recycled metal, finished steel products, auto bodies, and other commodities. The timing and magnitude of industry cycles are difficult to predict and are impacted by general economic conditions. We respond to increases and decreases in forward selling prices by adjusting purchase prices. We actively manage our exposure to commodity price risk and monitor the actual and expected spread between forward selling prices and purchase costs and processing and shipping expense. Sales contracts are based on prices negotiated with our customers, and generally orders are placed 30 to 60 days ahead of the shipment date. However, financial results may be negatively impacted when forward selling prices fall more quickly than we can adjust purchase prices or when customers fail to meet their contractual obligations. We assess the net realizable value of inventory NRV each quarter based upon contracted sales orders and estimates of future selling prices. Based on contracted sales and estimates of future selling prices, a 10 decrease in the selling price of inventory would not have had a material NRV impact as of August 31, 2024 and 2023. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt obligations. Our revolving credit facility is subject to variable interest rates and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates. We may at times use derivative instruments to manage some portion of this risk. Our interest rate swap derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount and are designed to hedge the variability in cash flows resulting from variable interest rates for a portion of our credit facilities. If market interest rates had changed 10 from actual interest rate levels in fiscal 2024 or 2023, including the effect of our interest rate swaps, the effect on our interest expense and net income would not have been material. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that might occur as a result of non-performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to take delivery of recycled metal and finished steel products and to make financial settlements of these obligations, or to provide sufficient quantities of scrap metal or payment to settle advances, loans and other contractual receivables in connection with demolition and scrap extraction projects. We manage our exposure to credit risk through a variety of methods, including shipping recycled ferrous metal exports under letters of credit, collection of deposits prior to shipment for certain nonferrous export customers, establishment of credit limits for certain sales on open terms, credit insurance and designation of collateral and financial guarantees securing advances, loans, and other contractual receivables. We have experienced reductions in the availability of credit insurance that we have historically used to cover a portion of our recycled metal and finished steel sales to domestic customers, which reduced availability may increase our exposure to customer credit risk. In addition, in higher or rising commodity price environments, we have experienced proportionately lower credit insurance coverage of applicable customer credit limits, which may increase our exposure to customer credit risk. 
 Historically, we have shipped almost all of our large shipments of recycled ferrous metal to foreign customers under contracts supported by letters of credit issued or confirmed by banks deemed creditworthy. The letters of credit ensure payment by the customer. As we generally sell export recycled ferrous metal under contracts or orders that generally provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed, our customers typically do not have difficulty obtaining letters of credit from their banks in periods of rising ferrous prices, as the value of the letters of credit are collateralized by the value of the inventory on the ship. However, in periods of significantly declining prices, or due to country specific currency limitations, our customers may not be able to obtain letters of credit for the full sales value of the inventory to be shipped. 
 As of August 31, 2024 and 2023, 28 and 38 , respectively, of our accounts receivable balance was covered by letters of credit, and the amount of past due receivables was not material. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk, mainly associated with sales transactions and related accounts receivable denominated in the U.S. Dollar by our Canadian subsidiary with a functional currency of the Canadian Dollar. In certain instances, we may use derivatives to manage some portion of this risk.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMEN TS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that relate to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of the Company s management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting using the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on its assessment, management determined that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2024. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, also audited the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, as stated in their report included herein.

Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Radius Recycling, Inc. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Radius Recycling, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Volume of Ferrous Metal Inventory 
 As described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s processed and unprocessed scrap metal inventory was 137 million as of August 31, 2024, of which processed and unprocessed ferrous metal inventory represents a significant portion. The accounting process the Company uses to record ferrous scrap metal quantities relies on significant estimates. With respect to estimating the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal inventory that are moved into production, management relies on weighed quantities of the processed ferrous material, adjusted for estimated metal recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and other judgments by management. Actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content, and the source of the unprocessed metal. The Company s estimates are intended to reasonably reflect the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal that are used in the production of processed ferrous metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates, management periodically reviews shrink factors and performs monthly physical inventories. Due to the inherent nature of the Company s scrap metal inventories, including variations in product density, holding period, and production processes utilized to manufacture the products, physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances for scrap metal inventory such that estimates of quantities are required. To mitigate this risk, the Company further adjusts its ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count is deemed to more accurately estimate the remaining volume. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the volume of ferrous metal inventory is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the ferrous metal inventory volumes. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the ferrous metal inventory volumes, including the ferrous metal recoveries and yields. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing inventory quantities received; (ii) assessing the reasonableness of management s estimated yields by comparing them to actual yields of ultimate ferrous metal recoveries; (iii) testing ferrous metal inventory shipments; (iv) observing certain of management s physical inventory counts; (v) assessing rollforward activity between the time of the inventory counts observed and year-end; and (vi) considering whether evidence obtained in other areas of the audit is consistent with management s estimates related to ferrous metal inventory volumes. 
 Goodwill Impairment Assessment One of the Metals Recycling Reporting Units and the Autos Reporting Unit 
 As described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s goodwill balance was 13 million as of August 31, 2024. Management evaluates goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired. When performing a quantitative impairment test, management records the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, based primarily on the respective financial and operational performance of the reporting units, as well as the sustained decrease in the Company s market capitalization, management identified a triggering event for three of its reporting units (two related to metals recycling, and one related to autos). The evaluation resulted in full impairment of the allocated goodwill and an aggregate impairment charge of 216 million, a substantial portion of which related to one of the metals recycling reporting units and the autos reporting unit. When management performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test, they consider both the income approach and market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The determination of fair value using the income approach involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates driven by future ferrous and nonferrous commodity price and sales volume expectations, gross margins, selling, general, and administrative expense relative to total revenues, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, discount rate, tax rate, terminal growth rate, benefits associated with a taxable transaction, and synergistic benefits available to market participants. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the interim goodwill impairment assessment of one of the metals recycling reporting units and the autos reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and 
 52 / Radius Recycling, Inc. Form 10-K Fiscal 2024 

Table of Contents 
 RADIUS RECYCLING, INC. 

effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to gross margins of both reporting units; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s interim goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of one of the metals recycling reporting units and the autos reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the income approach; and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to gross margins. Evaluating management s assumptions related to gross margins involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach.

Other assets as of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 also included million and million, respectively, representing advances to a supplier of metals recycling equipment. Other assets as of August 31, 2023 also included approximately million in connection with cash deposited into a client trust account in fiscal 2021 to fund the remediation of a site, a portion of which was previously leased to and operated by an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary. The cash was deposited into the client trust account by other potentially liable parties in connection with settlement of a lawsuit relating to allocation of the remediation costs, including agreement by the Company s subsidiary to perform certain remedial actions. During fiscal 2024, the million was distributed to the Company from the client trust account for purposes of holding the funds and maximizing returns, each consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement, of which million was held in certificates of deposit which mature in July of 2025 and is reported within prepaid expenses and other current assets as of August 31, 2024. See Other Legacy Environmental Loss Contingencies within Contingencies Environmental in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion of this matter. The Company invested million in the equity of a privately-held U.S. waste and recycling entity in fiscal 2017. The investment is accounted for under the guidance for investments in equity securities. In August 2022, the privately-held entity merged with a publicly-traded U.S. entity. During fiscal 2023, the Company recorded million of impairment and other adjustments of the equity investment to its fair value, reported within other expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of August 31, 2024 and 2023 , the fair value of the investment reported within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was less than million and million, respectively. Other assets as of August 31, 2024 and 2023 included million and million, respectively, of capitalized cloud computing implementation costs. The Company s cloud computing arrangements primarily comprise hosting arrangements which are service contracts, whereby the Company gains remote access to use enterprise software hosted by the vendor or another third party on an as-needed basis for a period of time in exchange for a subscription fee. Subscription fees are usually prepaid and recorded in operating expense over the period that the Company has access to use the software. Implementation costs for cloud computing arrangements are capitalized if certain criteria are met and consist of internal and external costs directly attributable to developing and configuring cloud computing software for its intended use. Amortization of capitalized implementation costs is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the cloud computing arrangement, which is the non-cancellable period of the agreement, together with periods covered by renewal options which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. During fiscal 2023, in connection with the pursuit of an alternative solution, the Company abandoned the implementation of a cloud computing arrangement and recorded a million impairment associated with previously capitalized cloud computing arrangement implementation costs. Debt issuance costs consist primarily of costs incurred by the Company to enter or modify its credit facilities. The Company reports deferred debt issuance costs within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortizes them to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement.

million and million during the years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting recovery of applicable losses including business income losses incurred as a result of the fire. On December 8, 2021, the Company experienced a fire at its metals recycling facility in Everett, Massachusetts. Direct physical loss or damage to property from the incident was limited to the facility s shredder building and equipment, with no bodily injuries and no physical loss or damage to property reported at other buildings or equipment. As a result of the fire, shredding operations ceased, while all non-shredding operations at the facility continued, including torching, shearing, separating, and sorting purchased non-shreddable recycled ferrous metals. On January 28, 2022, shredding operations at the facility began ramping up following the replacement and repairs to shredder equipment that had been damaged. In addition, shredding operations temporarily ceased at the facility on June 18, 2022 and, following discussions with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the Massachusetts Attorney General s office, the Company installed a temporary emission capture system and controls that allowed for the resumption of shredding operations on November 11, 2022 and for continued operation during the repair and replacement of the shredder enclosure building. Non-shredding operations at the facility continued during this period. The repair and replacement of most property that experienced physical loss or damage, primarily buildings and improvements, was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2023. The Company filed insurance claims for the property that experienced physical loss or damage and business income losses resulting from the matter. In fiscal 2024, the Company reached a full and final settlement with its insurers for its claims, and all insurance proceeds and recovery gains in connection with the Company s claims had been received and recognized, respectively, as of August 31, 2024. The amount of insurance recovery gains recognized within cost of goods sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations was million, million, and million during the years ended August 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 , respectively, reflecting recovery of applicable losses including business income losses incurred as a result of the fire.

The joint venture sells recycled metal to the Company s operations at prices that approximate local market rates, which produces intercompany profit. This intercompany profit is eliminated while the products remain in inventory and is not recognized until the finished products are sold to third parties. As of August 31, 2024, the Company s investments in equity method joint ventures have generated million in cumulative undistributed earnings. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions for further detail on transactions with joint ventures. A loss in value of an investment in a joint venture is recognized when the decline is other than temporary. Management considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investments including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the joint venture business, and the Company s intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Once management determines that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the investment is written down to its fair value, which establishes a new cost basis. The Company determines fair value using Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow analysis.

The Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The Company did t record impairment charges on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the periods presented.

million, which was allocated to reporting unit, a recycling services operation. The Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for this reporting unit and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of the testing date, and, therefore, no further impairment testing was required. Fiscal 2024 Goodwill Impairment In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company identified a triggering event that indicated the goodwill allocated to certain of the Company s reporting units may be impaired. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company had most recently performed the quantitative impairment test for goodwill carried by of its reporting units, consisting of two regional metals recycling operations and its network of auto parts stores, as of July 1, 2023, as described under the Fiscal 2023 Impairment subheading within this Note 8, below. Based primarily on the respective financial and operational performance of certain of the Company s reporting units with allocated goodwill, as well as the sustained decrease in the Company s market capitalization beginning near the end of the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2024, and substantially maintained throughout March and April 2024, the Company identified a triggering event and performed an interim impairment test. As of the May 1, 2024 testing date, the balance of the Company s goodwill was million, which was allocated among reporting units. Three of the reporting units, which consist of two regional metals recycling operations and the Company s network of auto parts stores, were allocated an aggregate of million of goodwill. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill allocated to these three reporting units to identify potential impairment and measure an impairment loss, if necessary. For the metals recycling reporting units and the autos reporting unit subject to the quantitative impairment test as of May 1, 2024, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, resulting in full impairment of the allocated goodwill and an aggregate impairment charge of million. The projections used in the income approach took into consideration, as applicable, the impact of recent and current market conditions for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metals and retail auto parts, the cost of obtaining adequate supply flows of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles, and recent trends in production and other operating costs. The projections assumed a recovery of operating margins from the levels experienced at the measurement date over a multi-year period. The WACC rate used in the income approach valuation ranged from to . The terminal growth rate used was . A reporting-unit-specific risk premium is embedded in the WACC to reflect the perceived level of uncertainty inherent in expected future cash flows. As part of the goodwill impairment test, the Company performed a reconciliation of its market capitalization to the aggregated estimated fair value of all reporting units, including consideration of a control premium.

million, which was allocated among reporting units. All of the approximately million of goodwill carried by one of the reporting units related to the business acquisition that was completed in fiscal 2023. The Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for this reporting unit and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value. The remaining million of goodwill as of the testing date was allocated among three reporting units, which consist of two regional metals recycling operations and the Company's network of auto parts stores. Based primarily on the respective financial and operational performance of each of these three reporting units and the Company overall, as well as the year-over-year decrease in the Company s market capitalization as of the testing date, the Company elected to not perform the qualitative assessment and to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test for goodwill allocated to the three reporting units to identify potential impairment and measure an impairment loss, if necessary. For one of the metals recycling reporting units and the autos reporting unit subject to the quantitative impairment test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately and , respectively, as of July 1, 2023. For the other metals recycling reporting unit, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, resulting in a partial impairment of goodwill of million. The projections used in the income approach took into consideration, as applicable, the impact of recent and current market conditions for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metals and retail auto parts, the cost of obtaining adequate supply flows of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles, and recent trends in production and other operating costs.

On June 17, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment to its Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2016, by and among the Company, as the U.S. Borrower, Schnitzer Steel Canada, Ltd., as the Canadian Borrower, the subsidiaries of the Company party thereto (the Guarantors ), Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (as amended prior to the Fourth Amendment, the Existing Credit Agreement , the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Amended Credit Agreement ).

The Company incurred million in debt issuance costs in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, which are amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the arrangement. The Fourth Amendment also revised the applicable interest rates under the facility which are based, at the Company s option, on either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR (or the Term Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average CORRA for C loans), plus a spread of between and , with the amount of the spread based on a pricing grid tied to the Company s ratio of consolidated net funded debt to EBITDA (as defined by the credit agreement), or the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus or (c) the daily rate equal to Term SOFR plus , in each case, plus a spread of between and based on a pricing grid tied to the Company s consolidated net funded debt to EBITDA ratio. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the credit facilities at rates between and based on a pricing grid tied to the Company s ratio of consolidated net funded debt to EBITDA. As of August 31, 2024 and 2023, borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities were million and million respectively. The weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facilities was and as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The credit agreement contains various representations and warranties, events of default, and financial and other customary covenants which limit (subject to certain exceptions) the Company s ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of the business, engage in transactions with affiliates, and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of the subsidiaries to make distributions. The financial covenants under the credit agreement included (a) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the four-quarter rolling sum of consolidated EBITDA less defined maintenance capital expenditures and certain environmental expenditures divided by consolidated fixed charges which, for the fiscal quarters ending May 31, 2024 through February 28, 2025, has been replaced with maintenance covenants during that period requiring compliance with a minimum permitted interest coverage ratio and a minimum permitted asset coverage ratio as per the Fourth Amendment as described above and (b) a consolidated leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded indebtedness divided by the sum of consolidated net worth and consolidated funded indebtedness. The Company s obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of its subsidiaries. The credit facilities and the related guarantees are secured by senior first priority liens on certain of the Company s and its subsidiaries assets, including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. The Fourth Amendment expanded the collateral package provided to the lenders to include most other personal property and equity interests held by the Company and the Guarantors in their respective subsidiaries. As of August 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the applicable financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. While the Company expects to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement, the Company may not be able to do so in the event market conditions do not improve, or other factors have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial position. If the Company does not maintain compliance with its financial covenants and is unable to obtain an amendment or waiver from its lenders, a breach of a financial covenant would constitute an event of default and allow the lenders to exercise remedies under the agreements, the most severe of which is the termination of the credit facility under the Amended Credit Agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed under the Agreement. Other debt obligations, which totaled million as of both August 31, 2024 and 2023 primarily relate to equipment purchases, the contract consideration for which includes an obligation to make future monthly payments to the vendor in the form of licensing fees. For accounting purposes, such obligations are treated as a partial financing of the purchase price by the equipment vendor. Monthly payments commence when the equipment is placed in service and achieves specified minimum operating metrics, with payments continuing for a period of thereafter.

The Company has environmental liabilities for the potential remediation of locations where it has conducted business or has environmental liabilities from historical or recent activities. These liabilities relate to the investigation and potential remediation of waterways and soil and groundwater contamination and may also involve natural resource damages, governmental fines and penalties, and claims by third parties for personal injury and property damage. Except for Portland Harbor and certain liabilities discussed under Other Legacy Environmental Loss Contingencies below, such liabilities were not individually material at any site. Portland Harbor In December 2000, the Company was notified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA that it is one of the potentially responsible parties PRPs that own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site Portland Harbor ). The precise nature and extent of cleanup of any specific areas within Portland Harbor, the parties to be involved, the timing of any specific remedial action and the allocation of the costs for any cleanup among responsible parties have not yet been determined. The process of site investigation, remedy selection, identification of additional PRPs, and allocation of costs has been underway for a number of years, but significant uncertainties remain. It is unclear to what extent the Company will be liable for environmental costs or third-party contribution or damage claims with respect to Portland Harbor. From 2000 to 2017, the EPA oversaw a remedial investigation/feasibility study RI/FS at Portland Harbor. The Company was not among the parties that performed the RI/FS, but it contributed to the costs through an interim settlement with the performing parties. The performing parties have indicated that they incurred more than million in that effort.

billion with a then net present value cost of billion (at a discount rate) and an estimated construction period of years following completion of the remedial designs. In the ROD, the EPA stated that the cost estimate is an order-of-magnitude engineering estimate that is expected to be within + to - of the actual project cost and that changes in the cost elements are likely to occur as a result of new information and data collected during the engineering design. Accordingly, the final cost may differ materially from that set forth in the ROD. The Company has identified a number of concerns regarding the remedy described in the ROD, which is based on data that is more than 15 years old, and the EPA s estimates for the costs and time required to implement the selected remedy. Moreover, the ROD provided only Portland Harbor site-wide cost estimates and did not provide sufficient detail to estimate costs for specific sediment management areas within Portland Harbor. In addition, the ROD did not determine or allocate the responsibility for remediation costs among the PRPs. In the ROD, the EPA acknowledged that much of the data was more than a decade old at that time and would need to be updated with a new round of baseline sampling to be conducted prior to the remedial design phase. The remedial design phase is an engineering phase during which additional technical information and data are collected, identified, and incorporated into technical drawings and specifications developed for the subsequent remedial action. Following issuance of the ROD, the EPA proposed that the PRPs, or a subgroup of PRPs, perform the additional investigative work in advance of remedial design. In December 2017, the Company and other PRPs entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to perform such pre-remedial design investigation and baseline sampling over a period. The report analyzing the results concluded that Portland Harbor conditions have improved substantially since the data forming the basis of the ROD was collected. The EPA found with a few limited corrections that the new baseline data is of suitable quality and stated that such data will be used, in addition to existing and forthcoming design-level data, to inform implementation of the ROD. However, the EPA did not agree that the data or the analysis warranted a change to the remedy at this time and reaffirmed its commitment to proceed with remedial design. The Company and other PRPs disagree with the EPA s position on use of the more recent data and will continue to pursue limited, but critical, changes to the selected remedy for Portland Harbor during the remedial design phase. The EPA encouraged PRPs to step forward (individually or in groups) to enter into consent agreements to perform remedial design in various project areas covering Portland Harbor. While certain PRPs executed consent agreements for remedial design work, because of the EPA s refusal to date to modify the remedy to reflect the most current data on Portland Harbor conditions and because of concerns with the terms of the consent agreement, the Company elected not to enter into a consent agreement. In April 2020, the EPA issued a unilateral administrative order UAO to the Company and MMGL, LLC MMGL ), an unaffiliated company, for the remedial design work in a portion of Portland Harbor designated as the River Mile 3.5 East Project Area. As required by the UAO, the Company notified the EPA of its intent to comply while reserving all of its sufficient cause defenses. Failure to comply with a UAO, without sufficient cause, could subject the Company to significant penalties or treble damages. Pursuant to the optimized remedial design timeline set forth in the UAO, the EPA s expected schedule for completion of the remedial design work was . At the time it issued the UAO in April 2020, the EPA estimated the cost of the work at approximately million. The Company has agreed with the other respondent to the UAO, MMGL, that the Company will lead the performance and be responsible for a portion of the costs of the work for remedial design under the UAO and also entered into an agreement with another PRP pursuant to which such other PRP has agreed to fund a portion of the costs of such work. These agreements are not an allocation of liability or claims associated with Portland Harbor as between the respondents or with respect to any third party. The Company has insurance policies and Qualified Settlement Funds QSFs pursuant to which the Company is being reimbursed for the costs it has incurred for remedial design. See further discussion of the QSFs below in this Note. As of both August 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had insurance and other receivables in the same amount as the environmental reserves for such remedial design work under the UAO. See Other Assets in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of insurance and other related receivables. The Company also expects to pursue in the future allocation or contribution from other PRPs for a portion of such remedial design costs. In February 2021, the EPA announced that percent of Portland Harbor s areas requiring active cleanup are in the remedial design phase of the process. Except for certain early action projects in which the Company is not involved, remediation activities at Portland Harbor are not expected to commence for a number of years. Moreover, those activities are expected to be sequenced, and the order and timing of such sequencing has not been determined. In addition, as noted above, the ROD does not determine the allocation of costs among PRPs. The Company has joined with approximately other PRPs, including the RI/FS performing parties, in a voluntary process to establish an allocation of costs at Portland Harbor, including the costs incurred in the RI/FS, ongoing remedial design costs, and future remedial action costs. The Company expects the next major stage of the allocation process to proceed in parallel with the remedial design process. The Company s environmental liabilities as of August 31, 2024 and 2023 included million and million, respectively, relating to the Portland Harbor matters described above.

million for this alleged natural resource damages liability as it continues to work with the Trustee Council to finalize an early settlement. As of August 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a receivable in the same amount as the environmental reserve. See Other Assets in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of insurance and other related receivables. On January 30, 2017, one of the Trustees, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, which withdrew from the council in 2009, filed a suit against approximately parties, including the Company, seeking reimbursement of certain past and future response costs in connection with remedial action at Portland Harbor and recovery of assessment costs related to natural resources damages from releases at and from Portland Harbor to the Multnomah Channel and the Lower Columbia River. The parties filed various motions to dismiss or stay this suit, and in August 2019, the court issued an order denying the motions to dismiss and staying the action. The Company intends to defend against the claims in this suit and does not have sufficient information to determine the likelihood of a loss in this matter or to estimate the amount of damages being sought or the amount of such damages that could be allocated to the Company. Because the final remedial actions have not yet been designed and there has not been a determination of the allocation among the PRPs of costs of the investigations or remedial action costs, the Company believes it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which it is likely to or which it is reasonably possible that it will incur in connection with Portland Harbor, although such costs could be material to the Company s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Among the facts being evaluated are detailed information on the history of ownership of and the nature of the uses of and activities and operations performed on each property within Portland Harbor, which are factors that will play a substantial role in determining the allocation of investigation and remedy costs among the PRPs. The Company has insurance policies that it believes will provide reimbursement for costs it incurs for defense, remediation, and mitigation for or settlement of natural resource damages claims in connection with Portland Harbor although there are no assurances that those policies will cover all the costs which the Company may incur. Most of these policies jointly insure the Company and MMGL, as the successor to a former subsidiary of the Company. The Company and MMGL have negotiated settlements with certain insurers of claims against them related to Portland Harbor, continue to seek settlements with other insurers, and formed two QSFs which became operative in fiscal 2020 and 2023, respectively, to hold such settlement amounts until funds are needed to pay or reimburse costs incurred by the Company and MMGL in connection with Portland Harbor. These insurance policies and the funds in the QSFs may not cover all of the costs which the Company may incur. Each QSF is an unconsolidated variable interest entity VIE with no primary beneficiary. Two managers unrelated to each other, one appointed by the Company and one appointed by MMGL, share equally the power to direct the activities of each VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance. The Company s appointee to co-manage each VIE is an executive officer of the Company. Neither MMGL nor its appointee to co-manage each VIE is a related party of the Company for the purpose of the primary beneficiary assessment or otherwise. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality is separately providing oversight of investigations and source control activities by the Company at various sites adjacent to Portland Harbor that are focused on controlling any current uplands releases of contaminants into the Willamette River. The Company has accrued liabilities for source control and related work at two sites, reflecting estimated costs of primarily investigation and design, which costs have not been material in the aggregate to date. No liabilities have been established in connection with investigations for any other sites because the extent of contamination, required source control work, and the Company s responsibility for the contamination and source control work, in each case if any, have not yet been determined. The Company believes that, pursuant to its insurance policies and agreements with other third parties, it will be reimbursed for the costs it incurs for required source control evaluation and remediation work; however, the Company's insurance policies and agreements with other third parties may not cover all the costs which the Company incurs. As of both August 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had an insurance receivable in the same amount as the environmental reserve for such source control work.

million for the estimated costs related to remediation of shredder residue disposed of in or around the 1970s at third-party sites located near each other. Investigation activities have been conducted under oversight of the applicable state regulatory agency. As of August 31, 2024 and 2023 , the Company had million and million, respectively, accrued for this matter. It is reasonably possible that the Company may recognize additional liabilities in connection with this matter at the time such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company previously estimated a range of reasonably possible losses related to this matter in excess of current accruals at between and million based on a range of remedial alternatives and subject to development and approval by regulators of specific remedy implementation plans. However, subsequent to the development of those remedial alternatives, the Company performed additional investigative activities under new state requirements that are likely to impact the required remedial actions and associated cost estimates , but the scope of such impacts and the amount or the range of the additional associated costs are not reasonably estimable at this time and are subject to further investigation, analysis, and discussion by the Company and regulators. In addition, the Company s loss contingencies as of August 31, 2024 and 2023 included million and million, respectively, for the estimated costs related to environmental matters in connection with a closed facility owned and previously operated by an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, including monitoring and remediation of soil and groundwater conditions and funding for wellhead treatment facilities. In fiscal 2023 the Company accrued an incremental million for certain soil remediation activities based on additional information related to estimated costs to complete. Investigation and remediation activities have been conducted under the oversight of the applicable state regulatory agency and are on-going, and the Company's subsidiary has also been working with state and local officials with respect to the protection of public and private water supplies. As part of its activities relating to the protection of public water supplies, the Company s subsidiary agreed to reimburse the municipality for certain studies and plans and to provide funding for the construction and operation by the municipality of wellhead treatment facilities. It is reasonably possible that the Company may recognize additional liabilities in connection with this matter at the time such additional losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. However, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible additional loss or range of possible additional losses associated with this matter pending the on-going implementation of the approved remediation plans for soil and groundwater conditions and completion and operation of the wellhead treatment facilities. In addition, the Company s loss contingencies as of both August 31, 2024 and 2023 included million, for the estimated costs related to remediation of a site a portion of which was previously leased to and operated by an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with settlement of a lawsuit relating to allocation of the remediation costs, the Company s subsidiary agreed to perform the remedial action related to metals contamination on the site initially estimated to cost approximately million, and another potentially liable party agreed to perform the remedial action related to creosote contamination at the site. As part of the settlement, other potentially liable parties agreed to make payments totaling approximately million to fund the remediation of the metals contamination at the site in exchange for a release and indemnity. This amount was fully funded in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2023, the Company increased its estimate of the cost to perform the remedial action by approximately million. It is reasonably possible that the Company may recognize additional liabilities in connection with this matter at the time such additional losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company estimates the reasonably possible additional losses associated with this matter to range from to million as of August 31, 2024, pending completion, approval, and implementation of the remediation action plan.

million in fines in the CAA Case, which claims the Company denies. The Company has vigorously defended against the claims asserted in the CAA Case, which is currently set for trial commencing November 12, 2024. The BAAQMD Case was remanded back to Alameda Superior Court on October 7, 2022, and no schedule has yet been established for that case. On June 28, 2024, the Alameda County Criminal Grand Jury returned an indictment against the Company and operations employees alleging felony and misdemeanor environmental regulatory violations for mishandling hazardous waste, including destruction of evidence, arising from the August 2023 scrap metal fire at the Company s Oakland, CA facility and the Company s subsequent shredding of the burned material. The Company disputes the allegations and intends to vigorously defend itself in connection with these allegations. The Company does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In addition to legal proceedings relating to the contingencies described above, the Company is a party to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The Company recognizes a liability for such matters when the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not anticipate that the liabilities arising from such legal proceedings in the normal course of business, after taking into consideration expected insurance recoveries, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

 Receivables from Contracts with Customers The revenue accounting standard defines a receivable as an entity s right to consideration that is unconditional, meaning that only the passage of time is required before payment is due. As of August 31, 2024 and 2023, receivables from contracts with customers, net of an allowance for credit losses, represented substantially all of total accounts receivable reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of each reporting date. Contract Liabilities Contract consideration received from a customer prior to revenue recognition is recorded as a contract liability and is recognized as revenue when the Company satisfies the related performance obligation under the terms of the contract. The Company s contract liabilities, which consist almost entirely of customer deposits for recycled metal and finished steel sales contracts reported within accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled million and million as of August 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Unsatisfied performance obligations reflected in these contract liabilities relate to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less and, therefore, are not disclosed. The substantial majority of outstanding contract liabilities are reclassified to revenues within three months of the reporting date as a result of satisfying performance obligations.

Net funded status 

Under the fair value hierarchy, plan assets comprised Level 1 and Level 2 investments as of August 31, 2024 and 2023 . significant contributions are expected to be made to the defined benefit pension plan in the future; however, changes in the discount rate or actual investment returns that are lower than the long-term expected return on plan assets could result in the need for the Company to make additional contributions. The assumed discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation was and as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company estimates future annual benefit payments to be between thousand and million per year. The Company also has a nonqualified SERBP for certain executives. A restricted trust fund has been established with assets invested in life insurance policies that can be used for plan benefits, although the fund is subject to claims of the Company s general creditors. The trust fund is included in other assets, the current portion of the pension liability is included in other accrued liabilities, and the noncurrent portion of the pension liability is included in other long-term liabilities in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The trust fund was valued at million as of each August 31, 2024 and 2023. The trust fund assets gains and losses are included in other expense, net in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The benefit obligation was million as of each of August 31, 2024 and 2023. Because the defined benefit pension plan and the SERBP are not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements, other disclosures required by U.S. GAAP have been omitted. Multiemployer Pension Plans The Company contributes to multiemployer pension plans in accordance with its collective bargaining agreements. Multiemployer pension plans are defined benefit plans sponsored by multiple employers in accordance with one or more collective bargaining agreements. The plans are jointly managed by trustees that include representatives from both management and labor unions. Contributions to the plans are made based upon a fixed rate per hour worked and are agreed to by contributing employers and the unions in collective bargaining. Benefit levels are set by a joint board of trustees based on the advice of an independent actuary regarding the level of benefits that agreed-upon contributions can be expected to support. To the extent that the pension obligation of other participating employers is unfunded, the Company may be required to make additional contributions in the future to fund these obligations. One of the multiemployer plans that the Company contributes to is the Steelworkers Western Independent Shops Pension Plan WISPP, EIN 90-0169564, Plan No. 001) benefiting the union employees of the Company s steel manufacturing operations, which are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire on . As of October 1, 2022, the WISPP was certified by the plan s actuaries as being in the Green Zone, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Company contributed million to the WISPP for each of the years ended August 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. These contributions represented more than of total contributions to the WISPP for each year. Company contributions to all of the multiemployer plans totaled million for the year ended August 31, 2024 , and million for each of the years ended August 31, 2023, and 2022. Defined Contribution Plans The Company has several defined contribution plans covering certain employees. Company contributions to the defined contribution plans totaled million , for the years ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 , and totaled million for the year ended August 31, 2022.

Additionally, any awards granted under the 1993 Plan and subsequently canceled or withheld in payment for taxes relating to an award vesting will become available for future grants under the 2024 Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of August 31, 2024 , there were million shares available for future grants.

RSUs generally vest per year over commencing October 31 of the year after grant. Each RSU entitles the recipient to receive share of Class A common stock upon vesting. The estimated fair value of an RSU is based on the market closing price of the underlying Class A common stock on the date of grant. C ompensation cost for RSUs is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards, net of forfeitures, which for participants who were retirement eligible as of the grant date or who will become retirement eligible during the term of the award is the longer of or the period ending on the date retirement eligibility is achieved.

For awards granted in fiscal 2024, the performance metrics are the Company s total shareholder return TSR based on the Company s average TSR percentile rank relative to a designated peer group and the Company s recycled metal volume growth. Award share payouts depend on the extent to which the performance goals have been achieved. The number of shares that a participant receives is equal to the number of performance shares granted multiplied by the payout factor, which ranges from a threshold of to a maximum of . The TSR awards granted in fiscal 2024 stipulate certain limitations to the payout in the event the payout reaches a defined ceiling level or the Company s TSR is negative. For awards granted in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the performance metrics are the Company s recycled metal volume growth and its return on capital employed ROCE ). Award share payouts depend on the extent to which the performance goals have been achieved, which performance-based payout factors are adjusted by a TSR modifier based on the Company s average TSR percentile rank relative to a designated peer group. The number of shares that a participant receives is equal to the number of performance shares granted multiplied by an initial payout factor based on recycled metal volume growth and ROCE, which ranges from a threshold of to a maximum of .

The fair value of the recycled metal volume growth awards granted in fiscal 2024, which awards do not have a TSR market condition, is based on the market closing price of the underlying Class A common stock on the grant date. 
 The compensation cost for the TSR-based performance share awards granted in fiscal 2024 is based on the grant-date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, and is recognized over the requisite service period (or to the date a qualifying employment termination event entitles the recipient to a prorated award, if before the end of the service period), regardless of whether the market condition has been or will be satisfied. The compensation cost for performance share awards with a non-market performance condition granted in fiscal year 2024 (recycled metals volume growth) and fiscal years 2023 and 2022 (either recycled metals volume growth or ROCE, with a TSR modifier) is recognized over the requisite service period (or to the date a qualifying employment termination event entitles the recipient to a prorated award, if before the end of the service period) based on the probable outcome of achieving the specified performance conditions, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company reassesses whether achievement of the performance conditions is probable at each reporting date. If it is probable that the actual performance results will exceed the stated target performance conditions, the Company accrues additional compensation cost for the additional performance shares to be awarded. If, upon reassessment, it is no longer probable that the actual performance results will exceed the stated target performance conditions, or that it is no longer probable that the target performance conditions will be achieved, the Company reverses any recognized compensation cost for shares no longer probable of being issued. If the performance conditions are not achieved at the end of the performance period, all related compensation cost previously recognized is reversed.

Deferred Stock Units DSUs The Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors DSU Plan provides for the issuance of DSUs to non-employee directors to be granted under the DSU Plan. Each DSU gives the director the right to receive share of Class A common stock at a future date. Immediately following the annual meeting of shareholders, each non-employee director receives DSUs which become fully vested on the day before the next annual meeting, subject to continued service on the Board. The compensation cost associated with the DSUs granted is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards. The Company issues Class A common stock to a director pursuant to vested DSUs in a lump sum in January of the first year after the director ceases to be a director of the Company, subject to the right of the director to elect an installment payment program under the DSU Plan. During the years ended August 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 the compensation cost associated with DSUs and the total value of shares granted and vested during each of these fiscal years, as well as the unrecognized compensation cost as of August 31, 2024 , were not material.

The Company s effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2024 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of primarily due to the effect of permanent differences from non-deductible goodwill and the recognition of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the Company s U.S. federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of primarily due to the aggregate effect of the relatively low absolute level of pre-tax earnings, permanent differences from non-deductible expenses, and unrecognized tax benefits. The Company s effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2022 approximated the U.S. federal statutory rate of , reflecting tax benefits from vesting of share-based awards, the foreign derived intangible income FDII deduction, and research and development credits, offset by the aggregate impact of state taxes and permanent differences from non-deductible expenses.

Incremental state operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire if not used on tax returns filed between fiscal years and . State credit carryforwards had a full valuation allowance and will begin to expire if not used on tax returns filed between fiscal years and .

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the security interests granted under this Agreement shall not extend to, and the Collateral shall not include, (i) Excluded Property or (ii) United States intent-to-use applications to register any trademark or service mark prior to the filing and acceptance by the USPTO under applicable Law of a verified statement of use or amendment to allege for such trademark or service mark, but only to the extent that, and solely during the period if any in which, the grant of security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark applications (or the resulting trademark registrations). 
 
 	The Grantors and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Obligations, hereby acknowledge and agree that the security interest created hereby in the Collateral (A) constitutes continuing collateral security for all of the Obligations, whether now existing or hereafter arising and (B) is not construed as an assignment of any Intellectual Property.

No Grantor has authenticated any agreement authorizing any secured party thereunder to file a financing statement with respect to the Collateral, except to perfect Liens permitted pursuant to Section 7.01 of the Credit Agreement.

 (vii)	Promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the holders of the Obligations after it learns that any material Patent or Trademark included in the Collateral is materially infringed, misappropriated, diluted or impaired by a third party and take such actions as it shall reasonably deem appropriate under the circumstances to protect such Patent or Trademark, including, where appropriate, the bringing of suit for infringement, misappropriation, dilution or impairment, to seek injunctive relief where appropriate and seeking to recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation, dilution or impairment. 
 (viii)	Not make any assignment or agreement in conflict with the security interest in the Patents or Trademarks of each Grantor included in the Collateral hereunder except as permitted or not prohibited by the Credit Agreement. 
 (ix)	Grants to the Administrative Agent, to be exercised solely upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuance thereof, a royalty free license to use such Grantor s Intellectual Property in connection with the enforcement of the Administrative Agent s rights under Section 7 and Section 8 of this Agreement, but only to the extent any license or agreement granting such Grantor rights in such Intellectual Property does not prohibit such use by the Administrative Agent; provided , that , the use of any Trademarks by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the license granted hereunder shall be subject to the maintenance of quality standards with respect to the goods and services on which such Trademarks are used sufficient to preserve the validity of such Trademarks.

 	5.	 Authorization to File Financing Statements . Each Grantor hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to prepare and file such financing statements (including continuation statements) or amendments thereof or supplements thereto or other instruments as the Administrative Agent may from time to time deem necessary or appropriate in order to perfect and maintain the security interests granted hereunder in accordance with the UCC, which such financing statements may describe the Collateral in the same manner as described herein or may contain an indication or description of Collateral that describes such property in any other manner as the Administrative Agent may reasonably determine is necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure the perfection of the security interest in the Collateral granted herein, including, without limitation, describing such property as all assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired or all personal property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired. 
 
 	6.	 Advances . On failure of any Grantor to perform any of the covenants and agreements contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent may, at its sole option and in

The Administrative Agent may make any payment hereby authorized in accordance with any bill, statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office or holder of the claim to be discharged without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien, title or claim except to the extent such payment is being contested in good faith by a Grantor in appropriate proceedings and against which adequate reserves are being maintained in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 	7.	 Remedies . 
 
 		(a)	 General Remedies . Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Obligations, shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies provided herein, in the Loan Documents, in any other documents relating to the Obligations, or by any applicable Law (including, but not limited to, levy of attachment, garnishment and the rights and remedies set forth in the UCC of the jurisdiction applicable to the affected Collateral), the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC (regardless of whether the UCC is the law of the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted and regardless of whether the UCC applies to the affected Collateral), and further, the Administrative Agent may, with or without judicial process or the aid and assistance of others, (i) enter on any premises on which any of the Collateral may be located and, without resistance or interference by the Grantors, take possession of the Collateral, (ii) dispose of any Collateral on any such premises, (iii) require the Grantors to assemble and make available to the Administrative Agent at the expense of the Grantors any Collateral at any place and time designated by the Administrative Agent which is reasonably convenient to both parties, (iv) remove any Collateral from any such premises for the purpose of effecting sale or other disposition thereof, and/or (v) without demand and without advertisement, notice, hearing or process of law, all of which each of the Grantors hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by Law, at any place and time or times, sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels any or all Collateral held by or for it at public or private sale (which in the case of a private sale of Pledged Equity, shall be to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof), at any exchange or broker s board or elsewhere, by one or more contracts, in one or more parcels, for money, upon credit or otherwise, at such prices and upon such terms as the Administrative Agent deems advisable, in its sole discretion (subject to any and all mandatory legal requirements). Each Grantor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the seller than the prices and other terms which might have been obtained at a public sale and, notwithstanding the foregoing, agrees that such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and, in the case of a sale of Pledged Equity, that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to delay sale of any such securities for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer of such securities to register such 
 13 

securities for public sale under the Securities Act of 1933. The Administrative Agent or any other holder of the Obligations shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold. Neither the Administrative Agent s compliance with applicable Law nor its disclaimer of warranties relating to the Collateral shall be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale. To the extent the rights of notice cannot be legally waived hereunder, each Grantor agrees that any requirement of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice, specifying the place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made, is personally served on or mailed, postage prepaid, to the US Borrower in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement at least ten (10) days before the time of sale or other event giving rise to the requirement of such notice. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Each Grantor further acknowledges and agrees that any offer to sell any Pledged Equity which has been (A) publicly advertised on a bona fide basis in a newspaper or other publication of general circulation in the financial community of New York, New York (to the extent that such offer may be advertised without prior registration under the Securities Act of 1933), or (B) made privately in the manner described above shall be deemed to involve a public sale under the UCC, notwithstanding that such sale may not constitute a public offering under the Securities Act of 1933, and the Administrative Agent may, in such event, bid for the purchase of such securities. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of the Collateral regardless of notice having been given. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any holder of the Obligations may be a purchaser at any such sale. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Grantors hereby waives all of its rights of redemption with respect to any such sale. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may postpone or cause the postponement of the sale of all or any portion of the Collateral by announcement at the time and place of such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, to the extent permitted by Law, be made at the time and place to which the sale was postponed, or the Administrative Agent may further postpone such sale by announcement made at such time and place. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Administrative Agent or any holder of the Obligations arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder except to the extent any such claims, damages or demands result solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any other holder of the Obligations as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in each case against whom such claim is asserted. Each Grantor agrees that the internet shall constitute a place for purposes of Section 9-610(b) of the UCC and that any sale of Collateral to a licensor pursuant to the terms of a license agreement between such licensor and a Grantor is sufficient to constitute a commercially reasonable sale (including as to method, terms, manner, and time) within the meaning of Section 9-610 of the UCC.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor the holders of the Obligations shall have any liability or responsibility to any Grantor for acceptance of a check, draft or other order for payment of money bearing the legend payment in full or words of similar import or any other restrictive legend or endorsement or be responsible for determining the correctness of any remittance.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, after three (3) Business Days prior written notice to each applicable Grantor: the Administrative Agent shall have the right to receive any and all cash dividends, payments or distributions made in respect of any Investment Property or Pledged Equity or other Proceeds paid in respect of any Investment Property or Pledged Equity, and any or all of any Investment Property or Pledged Equity may, at the option of the Administrative Agent, be registered in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee, and the Administrative Agent or its nominee may thereafter exercise (i) all voting, corporate and other rights pertaining to such Investment Property, or any such Pledged Equity at any meeting of shareholders, partners or members of the relevant Issuers or otherwise and (ii) any and all rights of conversion, exchange 
 15 

and subscription and any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to such Investment Property or Pledged Equity as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including, without limitation, the right to exchange at its discretion any and all of the Investment Property or Pledged Equity upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate, partnership or limited liability company structure of any Issuer or upon the exercise by any Grantor or the Administrative Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to such Investment Property or Pledged Equity, and in connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any and all of the Investment Property or Pledged Equity with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may determine), all without liability except to account for property actually received by it; but the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or option and the Administrative Agent and the other holders of the Obligations shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing. In furtherance thereof, each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer with respect to any Collateral consisting of Investment Property and/or Pledged Equity to (A) comply with any instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in writing that (1) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (2) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer shall be fully protected in so complying following receipt of such notice and prior to notice that such Event of Default is no longer continuing, and (B) except as otherwise expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends, distributions or other payments with respect to any Investment Property or Pledged Equity directly to the Administrative Agent. Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Administrative Agent shall have given three (3) Business Days notice to the relevant Grantor of the Administrative Agent s intent to exercise its corresponding rights pursuant to this Section 7 , each Grantor shall be permitted to receive all cash dividends, payments or other distributions made in respect of any Investment Property and any Pledged Equity, in each case paid in the normal course of business of the relevant Issuer and consistent with past practice, to the extent permitted in the Credit Agreement, and to exercise all voting and other corporate, company and partnership rights with respect to any Investment Property and Pledged Equity to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

In addition, the Administrative Agent may remove Collateral, or any part thereof, from such premises and/or any records with respect thereto, in order to effectively collect or liquidate such Collateral. 
 
 		(f)	 Nonexclusive Nature of Remedies . Failure by the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Obligations to exercise any right, remedy or option under this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any other document relating to the Obligations, or as provided by Law, or any delay by the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Obligations in exercising the same, shall not operate as a waiver of any such right, remedy or option. No waiver hereunder shall be effective unless it is in writing, signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced and then only to the extent specifically stated, which in the case of the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Obligations shall only be granted as provided herein. To the extent permitted by Law, neither the Administrative Agent, the holders of the Obligations, nor any party acting as attorney for the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Obligations, shall be liable hereunder for any acts or omissions or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law other than their 
 16 

gross negligence or willful misconduct hereunder as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Administrative Agent accords its own property, which shall be no less than the treatment employed by a reasonable and prudent agent in the industry, it being understood that the Administrative Agent shall not have responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any of the Collateral. In the event of a public or private sale of Collateral pursuant to Section 7 hereof, the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for (i) ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relating to any Collateral, whether or not the Administrative Agent has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or (ii) taking any steps to clean, repair or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale.

 (ii)	During the continuance of an Event of Default, (A) all rights of a Grantor to exercise the voting and other consensual rights which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to clause (i)(A) above shall cease and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Administrative Agent which shall then have the sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual rights, (B) all rights of a Grantor to receive the dividends, principal and interest payments which it would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to clause (i)(B) above shall cease and all such rights shall thereupon be vested in the Administrative Agent which shall then have the sole right to receive and hold as Collateral such dividends, principal and interest payments, and (C) all dividends, principal and interest payments which are received by a Grantor contrary to the provisions of clause (ii)(B) above shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such Grantor, and shall be forthwith paid over to the Administrative Agent as Collateral in the exact form received, to be held by the Administrative Agent as Collateral and as further collateral security for the Obligations.

(ii) The Administrative Agent may release any of the Pledged Equity from this Agreement or may substitute any of the Pledged Equity for other Pledged Equity without altering, varying or diminishing in any way the force, effect, lien, pledge or security interest of this Agreement as to any Pledged Equity not expressly released or substituted, and this Agreement shall continue as a first priority lien on all Pledged Equity not expressly released or substituted.

 (b)	Each of the Grantors jointly and severally hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a primary obligor, joint and several liability with the other Grantors with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations, it being the intention of the parties hereto that (i) all the Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each of the Grantors without preferences or distinction among them and (ii) a separate action may be brought against each Grantor to enforce this Agreement whether or not any Borrower, any other Grantor or any other person or entity is joined as a party. 
 
 (c)	Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, in any other of the Loan Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Grantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of such Grantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under applicable law (whether federal or state and including, without limitation, Debtor Relief Laws). 
 
 22 

22.	 Consent of Issuers of Pledged Equity . Any party hereto that is an Issuer hereby acknowledges, consents and agrees to the grant of the security interests in such Pledged Equity by the applicable Grantors pursuant to this Agreement, together with all rights accompanying such security interest as provided by this Agreement and applicable Law, notwithstanding any anti-assignment provisions in any operating agreement, limited partnership agreement or similar organizational or governance documents of such Issuer.

This Agreement does not constitute a novation of the obligations and liabilities existing under the Existing Security Agreement, and this Agreement evidences the obligations of the Grantors (as defined in the Existing Security Agreement) that are party hereto under the Existing Security Agreement as continued and amended and restated hereby.

 	The Grantors and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Obligations, hereby acknowledge and agree that the security interest created hereby in the Collateral (A) constitutes continuing collateral security for all of the Obligations, whether now existing or hereafter arising and (B) is not construed as an assignment of any Intellectual Property.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Obligations, shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies provided herein, in the Loan Documents, in any other documents relating to the Obligations, or by any applicable Law (including, but not limited to, levy of attachment, garnishment and the rights and remedies set forth in the PPSA of the jurisdiction applicable to the affected Collateral), the rights and remedies of a secured party under the PPSA (regardless of whether the PPSA is the law of the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted and regardless of whether the PPSA applies to the affected Collateral), and further, the Administrative Agent may, with or without judicial process or the aid and assistance of others, (i) enter on any premises on which any of the Collateral may be located and, without resistance or interference by the Grantors, take possession of the Collateral, (ii) dispose of any Collateral on any such premises, (iii) require the Grantors to assemble and make available to the Administrative Agent at the expense of the Grantors any Collateral at any place and time designated by the Administrative Agent which is reasonably convenient to both parties, (iv) remove any Collateral from any such premises for the purpose of effecting sale or other disposition thereof, and/or (v) without demand and without advertisement, notice, hearing or process of law, all of which each of the Grantors hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by Law, at any place and time or times, sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels any or all Collateral held by or for it at public or private sale, at any exchange or broker's board or elsewhere, by one or more contracts, in one or more parcels, for money, upon credit or otherwise, at such prices and upon such terms as the Administrative Agent deems advisable, in its sole discretion (subject to any and all mandatory legal requirements). Each Grantor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at prices and on terms less favourable to the seller than the prices and other terms which might have been obtained at a public sale and, notwithstanding the foregoing, agrees that such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and, in the case of a sale of Pledged Equity, that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to delay sale of any such securities for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer of such securities to register such securities for public sale under applicable securities Laws. The Administrative Agent or any other holder of the Obligations shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold. Neither the Administrative Agent's compliance with applicable Law nor its disclaimer of warranties relating to the Collateral shall be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale. Each Grantor waives giving of notice to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. To the extent the rights of notice cannot be legally waived hereunder, each Grantor agrees that any requirement of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice, specifying the place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made, is personally served on or mailed, postage prepaid, to the US Borrower in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement at least ten (10) days before the time of sale or other event giving rise to the requirement of such notice. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. If the Administrative Agent determines 
 14 

to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Pledged Equity, each Grantor agrees that, upon request of the Administrative Agent, such Grantor will, at its own expense, do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as may be necessary to make such sale of the Pledged Equity or any part thereof valid and binding and in compliance with applicable Law. The Administrative Agent is not required to take steps to qualify, or cause to be qualified, any Equity Interests forming part of the Pledged Equity for public distribution or request the issuer to qualify them. The Administrative Agent need not dispose of any securities by public distribution even if they are qualified for public distribution. The Administrative Agent may dispose of securities by an exemption from the prospectus requirements of applicable securities legislation as it considers appropriate notwithstanding that doing so may require them to comply with limitations or restrictions relating to the exemption. The limitations or restrictions may include complying with procedures that may restrict the number of prospective bidders and purchasers, requiring that prospective bidders and purchasers have certain qualifications (including being accredited investors, agreeing to pay a minimum price or demonstrating qualifications required to obtain any approval of the sale or resulting purchase that is required under applicable Law), and restricting prospective bidders and purchasers to those who will represent and agree that they are purchasing as principal for their own account for investment and not with a view to distribution or resale. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of the Collateral regardless of notice having been given. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any holder of the Obligations may be a purchaser at any such sale. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Grantors hereby waives all of its rights of redemption with respect to any such sale. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may postpone or cause the postponement of the sale of all or any portion of the Collateral by announcement at the time and place of such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, to the extent permitted by Law, be made at the time and place to which the sale was postponed, or the Administrative Agent may further postpone such sale by announcement made at such time and place. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Administrative Agent or any holder of the Obligations arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder except to the extent any such claims, damages or demands result solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any other holder of the Obligations as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in each case against whom such claim is asserted. Each Grantor agrees that the internet shall constitute a place for purposes of the PPSA and that any sale of Collateral to a licensor pursuant to the terms of a license agreement between such licensor and a Grantor is sufficient to constitute a commercially reasonable sale (including as to method, terms, manner, and time) within the meaning of the PPSA. 
 
 		(b)	 Remedies Relating to Accounts . 
 
 		(i)	Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, whether or not the Administrative Agent has exercised any or all of its rights and remedies hereunder, and so long as the Administrative Agent has provided three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to each applicable Grantor, (A) promptly upon the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent, each Grantor shall instruct all Account Debtors to remit all payments in respect of Accounts to a mailing location selected by the Administrative Agent and (B) the Administrative Agent shall have the right to enforce any Grantor's rights against its customers and Account Debtors, and the Administrative Agent or its designee may notify any Grantor's customers and Account Debtors that the Accounts of such Grantor have been assigned to the Administrative Agent or of the Administrative Agent's security interest therein, and may (either in its own name or in the name of a Grantor or both) demand, collect (including without limitation by way of a lockbox arrangement), receive, take receipt for, sell, sue for, compound, settle, compromise and 
 15 

give acquittance for any and all amounts due or to become due on any Account, and, in the Administrative Agent's discretion, file any claim or take any other action or proceeding to protect and realize upon the security interest of the holders of the Obligations in the Accounts. 
 
 		(ii)	Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof and so long as the Administrative Agent has provided three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to each applicable Grantor, each such Grantor acknowledges and agrees that the Proceeds of its Accounts remitted to or on behalf of the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be solely for the Administrative Agent's own convenience and that such Grantor shall not have any right, title or interest in such Accounts or in any such other amounts except as expressly provided herein. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the holders of the Obligations shall have any liability or responsibility to any Grantor for acceptance of a cheque, draft or other order for payment of money bearing the legend payment in full or words of similar import or any other restrictive legend or endorsement or be responsible for determining the correctness of any remittance. 
 
 		(iii)	Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, and so long as the Administrative Agent has provided three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to each applicable Grantor, (A) the Administrative Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make test verifications of the Accounts in any manner and through any medium that it reasonably considers advisable, and the Grantors shall furnish all such assistance and information as the Administrative Agent may require in connection with such test verifications, (B) upon the Administrative Agent's request and at the expense of the Grantors, the Grantors shall cause independent public accountants or others satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to furnish to the Administrative Agent reports showing reconciliations, aging and test verifications of, and trial balances for, the Accounts and (C) the Administrative Agent in its own name or in the name of others may communicate with Account Debtors on the Accounts to verify with them to the Administrative Agent's satisfaction the existence, amount and terms of any Accounts. 
 
 (c)	 Deposit Accounts/Securities Accounts . Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during continuation thereof, and solely to the extent permitted by the PPSA or other applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may prevent withdrawals or other dispositions of funds in Deposit Accounts and Securities Accounts held with any holder of the Obligations. 
 
 (d)	 Investment Property/Pledged Equity . Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, after (3) Business Days' prior written notice to each applicable Grantor: the Administrative Agent shall have the right to receive any and all cash dividends, payments or distributions made in respect of any Investment Property or Pledged Equity or other Proceeds paid in respect of any Investment Property or Pledged Equity, and any or all of any Investment Property or Pledged Equity may, at the option of the Administrative Agent, be registered in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee, and the Administrative Agent or its nominee may thereafter exercise (i) all voting, corporate and other rights pertaining to such Investment Property, or any such Pledged Equity at any meeting of shareholders, partners or members of the relevant Issuers or otherwise and (ii) any and all rights of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to such Investment Property or Pledged Equity as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including, without limitation, the right to exchange at its discretion any and all of the Investment Property or Pledged Equity upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the 
 16 

corporate, partnership or limited liability company structure of any Issuer or upon the exercise by any Grantor or the Administrative Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to such Investment Property or Pledged Equity, and in connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any and all of the Investment Property or Pledged Equity with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may determine), all without liability except to account for property actually received by it; but the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or option and the Administrative Agent and the other holders of the Obligations shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing. In furtherance thereof, each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer with respect to any Collateral consisting of Investment Property and/or Pledged Equity to (A) comply with any instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in writing that (1) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (2) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer shall be fully protected in so complying following receipt of such notice and prior to notice that such Event of Default is no longer continuing, and (B) except as otherwise expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends, distributions or other payments with respect to any Investment Property or Pledged Equity directly to the Administrative Agent. Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Administrative Agent shall have given three (3) Business Days' notice to the relevant Grantor of the Administrative Agent's intent to exercise its corresponding rights pursuant to this Section 7 , each Grantor shall be permitted to receive all cash dividends, payments or other distributions made in respect of any Investment Property and any Pledged Equity, in each case paid in the normal course of business of the relevant Issuer and consistent with past practice, to the extent permitted in the Credit Agreement, and to exercise all voting and other corporate, company and partnership rights with respect to any Investment Property and Pledged Equity to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 
 (e)	 Access . In addition to the rights and remedies hereunder, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to enter and remain upon the various premises of the Grantors without cost or charge to the Administrative Agent, and use the same, together with materials, supplies, books and records of the Grantors for the purpose of collecting and liquidating the Collateral, or for preparing for sale and conducting the sale of the Collateral, whether by foreclosure, auction or otherwise. In addition, the Administrative Agent may remove Collateral, or any part thereof, from such premises and/or any records with respect thereto, in order to effectively collect or liquidate such Collateral. 
 
 		(f)	 Non-exclusive Nature of Remedies . Failure by the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Obligations to exercise any right, remedy or option under this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any other document relating to the Obligations, or as provided by Law, or any delay by the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Obligations in exercising the same, shall not operate as a waiver of any such right, remedy or option. No waiver hereunder shall be effective unless it is in writing, signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced and then only to the extent specifically stated, which in the case of the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Obligations shall only be granted as provided herein. To the extent permitted by Law, neither the Administrative Agent, the holders of the Obligations, nor any party acting as attorney for the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Obligations, shall be liable hereunder for any acts or omissions or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law other than their gross negligence or willful misconduct hereunder as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the holders of the Obligations under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Obligations may 
 17 

have. The Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to marshal in favour of the Grantors any other security interest or lien or any money or other property that the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Obligations may be entitled to receive or may have a claim upon. 
 
 		(g)	 Retention of Collateral . In addition to the rights and remedies hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in compliance with Section 61 of the PPSA or otherwise complying with the requirements of applicable Law of the relevant jurisdiction, accept or retain the Collateral in satisfaction of the Obligations. Unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have provided such notices, however, the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have retained any Collateral in satisfaction of any Obligations for any reason. 
 
 		(h)	Receiver. The Administrative Agent may take proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a receiver (which term includes a receiver and manager) of the Collateral or may by appointment in writing appoint any person to be a receiver of the Collateral. The Administrative Agent may remove any receiver appointed by it and appoint another in its place, and may determine the remuneration of any receiver, which may be paid from the proceeds of the Collateral in priority to other Obligations. Any receiver appointed by the Administrative Agent shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, have all of the rights, benefits and powers of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the PPSA or otherwise. Any receiver shall be deemed the agent of the Grantors and the Administrative Agent shall not be in any way responsible for any misconduct or negligence of any receiver. 
 
 		(i)	 Waiver; Deficiency . Each Grantor hereby waives, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, all rights of redemption, appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or moratorium now or hereafter in force under any applicable Laws in order to prevent or delay the enforcement of this Agreement or the absolute sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof. In the event that the proceeds of any sale, collection or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Obligations are legally entitled, the Grantors shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate, together with the costs of collection and the fees, charges and disbursements of counsel. Any surplus remaining after the full payment and satisfaction of the Obligations shall be returned to the Grantors or to whomsoever a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine to be entitled thereto. 
 
 	8.	 Rights of the Administrative Agent . 
 
 		(a)	 Power of Attorney . In addition to other powers of attorney contained herein, each Grantor hereby designates and appoints the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Obligations, and each of its designees or agents, as attorney-in-fact of such Grantor, irrevocably and with power of substitution, with authority to take any or all of the following actions upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, to, after three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to each applicable Grantor:

 		(v)	sell, assign, transfer, make any agreement in respect of, or otherwise deal with or exercise rights in respect of, any Collateral or the goods or services which have given rise thereto, as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes;

 		(vii)	execute and deliver all assignments, conveyances, statements, financing statements, continuation financing statements, security agreements, affidavits, notices and other agreements, instruments and documents that the Administrative Agent may determine necessary in order to perfect and maintain the security interests and liens granted in this Agreement and in order to fully consummate all of the transactions contemplated herein in respect of or arising out of the Collateral; 
 
 	(viii)	institute any foreclosure proceedings that the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate in respect of or arising out of the Collateral; 
 
 	(ix)	sign and endorse any drafts, assignments, proxies, stock powers, verifications, notices and other documents relating to the Collateral;

 (xi)	vote for a shareholder resolution, or to sign an instrument in writing, sanctioning the transfer of any or all of the Pledged Equity into the name of the Administrative Agent or one or more of the holders of the Obligations or into the name of any transferee to whom the Pledged Equity or any part thereof may be sold pursuant to Section 7 ; 
 
 (xii)	pay or discharge taxes, liens, security interests or other encumbrances levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral;

 (xvi)	do and perform all such other acts and things as the Administrative Agent may reasonably deem to be necessary, proper or convenient in connection with the Collateral. 
 
 	This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until such time as the Obligations arising under the Loan Documents have been paid in full and the Commitments have expired or been terminated. The Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges and options expressly or implicitly granted to the Administrative Agent in this Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing so. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any act or omission or for any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or law in its individual capacity or its capacity as attorney-in-fact except acts or omissions resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. This power of attorney is conferred on the Administrative Agent solely to protect, preserve and realize upon its security interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Administrative Agent or any other holder of the Obligations to exercise any such powers. 
 
 		(b)	 Assignment by the Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent may from time to time assign the Obligations to a successor Administrative Agent appointed in accordance with the Credit Agreement, and such successor shall be entitled to all of the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement in relation thereto. 
 
 		(c)	 The Administrative Agent's Duty of Care . Other than the exercise of reasonable care to assure the safe custody of the Collateral while being held by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or liability to preserve rights pertaining thereto, it being understood and agreed that the Grantors shall be responsible for preservation of all rights in the Collateral, and the Administrative Agent shall be relieved of all responsibility for the Collateral upon surrendering it or tendering the surrender of it to the Grantors. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Administrative Agent accords its own property, which shall be no less than the treatment employed by a reasonable and prudent agent in the industry, it being understood that the Administrative Agent shall not have responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any of the Collateral. In the event of a public or private sale of Collateral pursuant to Section 7 hereof, the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for (i) ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relating to any Collateral, whether or not the Administrative Agent has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or (ii) taking any steps to clean, repair or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale. 
 
 		(d)	 Liability with Respect to Accounts . Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each of the Grantors shall remain liable under each of the Accounts to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement giving rise to each such Account. Neither the 
 20 

Administrative Agent nor any holder of the Obligations shall have any obligation or liability under any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Administrative Agent or any holder of the Obligations of any payment relating to such Account pursuant hereto, nor shall the Administrative Agent or any holder of the Obligations be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of a Grantor under or pursuant to any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party under any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times. 
 	 
 	(e)	 Voting and Payment Rights in Respect of the Pledged Equity . 
 
 (i)	So long as no Event of Default shall exist, each Grantor may (A) exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Equity of such Grantor or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the Credit Agreement and (B) receive and retain any and all dividends (other than stock dividends and other dividends constituting Collateral which are addressed hereinabove), principal or interest paid in respect of the Pledged Equity to the extent they are allowed under the Credit Agreement; and 
 
 (ii)	During the continuance of an Event of Default, (A) all rights of a Grantor to exercise the voting and other consensual rights which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to clause (i)(A) above shall cease and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Administrative Agent which shall then have the sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual rights, (B) all rights of a Grantor to receive the dividends, principal and interest payments which it would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to clause (i)(B) above shall cease and all such rights shall thereupon be vested in the Administrative Agent which shall then have the sole right to receive and hold as Collateral such dividends, principal and interest payments, and (C) all dividends, principal and interest payments which are received by a Grantor contrary to the provisions of clause (ii)(B) above shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such Grantor, and shall be forthwith paid over to the Administrative Agent as Collateral in the exact form received, to be held by the Administrative Agent as Collateral and as further collateral security for the Obligations. 
 
 	(f)	 Releases of Collateral . 
 
 (i) If any Collateral shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by any Grantor in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement, then the Administrative Agent, at the request and sole expense of such Grantor, shall promptly execute and deliver to such Grantor all releases and other documents, and take such other action, reasonably necessary for the release of the Liens created hereby or by any other Collateral Document on such Collateral. 

(ii) The Administrative Agent may release any of the Pledged Equity from this Agreement or may substitute any of the Pledged Equity for other Pledged Equity without altering, varying or diminishing in any way the force, effect, lien, pledge or security interest of this Agreement as to any Pledged Equity not expressly released or substituted, and this 

21 

Agreement shall continue as a first priority lien on all Pledged Equity not expressly released or substituted. 

9.	 Application of Proceeds . After the exercise of remedies provided for in Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement (or upon acceleration of the Obligations pursuant to Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement), any payments in respect of the Obligations and any proceeds of the Collateral, when received by the Administrative Agent or any holder of the Obligations in cash or cash equivalents will be applied in reduction of the Obligations in the order set forth in Section 8.03 of the Credit Agreement.

Accordingly, each Grantor shall be entitled to receive and retain for its own account any dividend, distribution, payment or other proceeds in respect of the ULC Shares (except insofar as such Grantor has granted a security interest in the dividend or other distribution in favour of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, in which case the other terms hereof granting a the security interest therein will apply thereto) and shall have the right to vote the ULC Shares and to control the direction, management and policies of the applicable Issuer of ULC Shares to the same extent as such Grantor would if the ULC Shares were not pledged to the Administrative Agent.

 25

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, except upon the exercise of rights to sell or otherwise dispose of the ULC Shares following the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Grantors shall not cause or permit or enable any Issuer of ULC Shares to cause or permit or enable the Administrative Agent or any holder of the Obligations to: (a) be registered as a shareholder of the Issuer; (b) have any notation entered in its favour in the share register or other books and records of a ULC in respect of any ULC Shares; (c) act or purport to act as a shareholder of the Issuer of ULC Shares, or obtain, exercise or attempt to exercise any rights of a shareholder of the Issuer of ULC Shares, including the right to attend a meeting of the Issuer, or to vote the ULC Shares; (d) be held out as shareholder or member of the Issuer; or (e) receive, directly or indirectly, any dividends, property or other distributions from the Issuer by reason of the Administrative Agent or any holder of the Obligations holding a security interest in the ULC Shares. The limitations in this Section shall not restrict the Administrative Agent from (i) exercising the rights to sell or otherwise dispose of ULC Shares that it is entitled to exercise under this Agreement or (ii) having the ULC Shares registered in its name, in either case at any time that the Administrative Agent is entitled to realize on all or any portion of the ULC Shares pursuant to this Agreement and, in either case, provided that the Administrative Agent has (y) given notice to such Grantor of its intention to realize upon those ULC Shares (including by selling or disposing of or re-registering those ULC Shares) and (z) consented in writing to any change in registration and not revoked its consent.

Exhibit 19.1 

 RADIUS RECYCLING, INC. 
 STOCK TRADING POLICY 

I. Introduction 

The Class A Common Stock of Radius Recycling, Inc. (the Company is publicly traded and, as a result, the Company is subject to U.S. securities laws intended to protect investors in the purchase and sale of securities, including laws prohibiting so called insider trading in the Company s stock. Violations of these laws can result in liability to the Company, as well as its directors, officers and employees. 
 
 Frequently, Company insiders will become aware of information that has not been disclosed to the public but which, if known, could be material to investment decisions. A purchase or sale of Company stock by an insider at such a time could expose the Company, and the individual insider, to a claim that the purchase or sale of stock was made on the basis of material information not known to the general public. 
 
 In an effort to minimize your and the Company s risk of being subject to such claims, while at the same time considering the need of the employees of the Company to have reasonable opportunities to purchase and sell Company stock, the Company has adopted this Stock Trading Policy (the Policy ), which applies to all employees and directors of the Company, and any other persons the Company determines should be subject to the Policy, such as contractors and consultants, and their household and immediate family members. All executive officers, directors and certain other designated employees of the Company who have regular access to material non-public information must also adhere to certain additional, stricter rules and procedures contained in Part III of this Policy. 
 
 In short, under this Policy: 
 
 You may not trade the Company s securities at any time when you have material, non-public information concerning the Company. It is your responsibility to be certain that you do not have material, non-public information when you determine to trade. 

You may not trade securities of another company at any time when you have material, non-public information about that company or its industry when that information was obtained as a result of your employment or relationship with the Company. 

You may not tip , or pass on material non-public information, to friends, family members or others and thereby try to help them make a profit or avoid a loss, and you may not make buy or sell recommendations on the basis of material, non-public information. 

Directors, executive officers, and other certain designated employees must provide the Company s Stock Compliance Officer with a written notice of a purchase or sale of the Company s stock as further described under Section 3 below. 

It is important for you to be aware of the rules concerning insider trading, and you should review this Policy carefully. Any questions relating to this Policy may be directed to the Company s Stock Compliance Officer, who currently is James Matthew Vaughn, the Company s Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary, or his or her designee, at generalcounsel@rdus.com. 
 II. Rules of General Application 

1. Material, Non-Public Information Inside Information 

In the normal course of business, you may become aware of significant, non-public information. This kind of information, often referred to as material, non-public information in U.S. securities laws, is considered the property of the Company; you have been entrusted with it. Accordingly, you may not seek to make a profit or avoid a loss from it by trading securities yourself or by passing on the information to others to enable them to make a profit or avoid a loss. This rule applies not only to trading in the Company s securities, but also to trading in the securities of other companies if you learn something in the course of your employment or relationship with the Company that might affect the value of those other securities. For instance, if you learned that the Company was about to execute a definitive acquisition agreement with another company, it would likely be an insider trading violation for you to trade in securities of that other company. The insider trading rules apply both to securities purchases (to make a profit based on good news) and securities sales (to avoid a loss based on bad news). You should also keep in mind that the Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and regulations provide that the mere fact that a person is aware of the information is a bar to trading. It is no excuse that such person s reasons for trading were not based on the information. 
 For information to be material within the meaning of U.S. securities laws, it must be information that a reasonable investor would consider important in making a decision to buy, hold or sell securities. The chances are, if you learn something that leads you to want to trade stock, that information will be considered material. Examples of inside information that are likely to be deemed material include, but are not limited to: 
 quarterly or annual financial results; 

projections of future earnings or losses or other earnings guidance, or significant changes to previously announced projections or guidance; 

a significant increase or decrease in financial results; 

significant actions by regulatory bodies; 

significant management changes; 

commencement or settlement of major litigation or government investigations; 

a purchase or sale of substantial assets; 

2 

a significant merger or acquisition proposal or agreement or termination of an agreement of this type; 

dividend increases or decreases; 

financings and other events involving the Company s securities; 

acquisition of, refinancing or repayment of significant debts or defaults on debt; 

a significant disruption in the Company s operations; or 

cybersecurity and privacy incidents or events. 

It is also important to keep in mind that information need not be certain or definitive to be material. Even information concerning events, actions, results, etc. that may happen can be considered material under certain circumstances. For example, if you found out that the Company was in merger negotiations, even though the deal had not yet been agreed to, that information could very well be material. 
 Situations may exist, where an employee or a director has a record ownership of or beneficial interest in securities but has no responsibility for investment decisions, such as, for example, where the investment decisions have been delegated to an investment adviser. In such cases, this Policy is not intended to proscribe dealings in securities so long as the employee or director has neither discussed the merits of the investment with, nor provided inside information to, the person or persons having the decision-making investment responsibility. Similarly, this Policy does not proscribe the purchase, sale or holding of an interest in a publicly traded mutual fund, even if the fund holds or trades in the Company s stock. 
 For the purpose of this Policy, information is non-public until information has been widely disseminated by the Company. In addition, the information disseminated must be some form of official announcement or disclosure, which, in the case of information about the Company, must be made by the Company. In other words, the fact that rumors, speculation, or statements attributed to unidentified sources are public is insufficient to be considered widely disseminated even when the rumors, speculation, or statements are accurate. After the information has been disseminated, a period of time must pass sufficient for the information to be absorbed by the general public. As a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed until after at least one full trading day has elapsed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market Nasdaq after the information has been publicly disclosed in a manner compliant with Regulation FD. 
 
 2. Prohibition on Tipping 

Besides your obligation to refrain from trading while in possession of material, non-public information, you are also prohibited from tipping material non-public information to others. The concept of unlawful tipping includes passing on material, non-public information to friends, family 
 3 

members or others, including recommendations to buy or sell Company stock based on material non-public information. When tipping occurs, both the tipper and the tippee may be held liable, and this liability may extend to all those to whom the tippee, in turn, gives the information. 
 3. Notice of Purchase or Sale of Company Stock 

Executive officers, directors and certain other designated employees of the Company must request pre-clearance by the Stock Compliance Officer before purchasing or selling Company stock, as described in part III of this Policy. A form to be used for pre-clearance is available on SharePoint. Following each purchase and sale of Company stock, such persons must provide the Company s Stock Compliance Officer with a written notice of such transaction not later than three business days following the sale or purchase. A form to be used for such notice is available on SharePoint. 
 
 If you are an executive officer or a director, you must also comply with the additional requirements in part III of this Policy, including the Broker Requirements for Section 16 Persons described in Section 6 of part III. 
 
 4. Exempt Transactions 

The prohibition on trading in the Company s securities set forth in this Policy does not apply to: 
 
 	transferring shares to an entity that does not involve a change in the beneficial ownership of the shares (for example, to certain types of trusts of which you are the sole beneficiary during your lifetime); 
 	the exercise of stock options to buy and hold the Company s stock (and not sell) (including any net settled stock option exercise to buy and hold) under our equity incentive plans; however, the sale of any such stock acquired upon such exercise, including as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option or to satisfy tax withholding requirements, is subject to this Policy; 
 	the withholding by the Company (whether mandated by the Company or pursuant to a tax withholding right) of shares of restricted stock, shares underlying restricted stock units or shares subject to an option, in each case to satisfy tax withholding requirements; and 
 	the execution of transactions pursuant to a trading plan that complies with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and which has been approved by the Company (see Section 2 of part III). 
 
 5. Short Selling of Company Stock and Hedging Transactions 

It is prohibited under this Policy for any director or employee to engage in any short sale of the Company s stock or in speculative trading (e.g. day-trading that is intended to take advantage of short-term price fluctuations, to establish or use a margin account with a broker-dealer for the purpose of buying or selling Company stock or using it as collateral, or to buy or sell puts, calls, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, exchange funds or other instruments or derivatives designed to hedge the value of the Company s stock. This Policy is designed to encourage investment in the Company s stock for the long term, on a buy and hold basis, and to discourage active trading or short-term speculation. 
 4 

6. Transactions by Family Members 

The restrictions set forth in this Policy apply to each family member who resides with you, anyone else who lives in your household, any other family members whose transactions in securities are directed by or subject to your influence or control and trusts, corporations or other entities controlled by you or such family members. You are expected to be responsible for the compliance by these persons with this Policy. 
 
 7. Consequences of Insider Trading 

The consequences of insider trading can be severe. Insider trading is a crime that could result in large criminal fines and/or jail for individuals. In addition, the SEC may seek to impose a civil penalty of up to three times the profits made or losses avoided from the trading. The SEC has imposed large penalties even when the disclosing person did not profit from trading. Insider traders must also disgorge any profits made and are often subjected to an injunction against future violations. Finally, under some circumstances, insider traders may be subjected to civil liability in private lawsuits. 
 
 Under the Insider Trading and Securities Enforcement Act of 1988, the Company and its controlling persons (including the Board of Directors and supervisory personnel) could also be held vicariously responsible for the insider trading violations of employees if they fail to adopt adequate policies and procedures to prevent insider trading. 
 
 For all of the foregoing reasons, it is very important, both to you and the Company, that insider trading violations not occur and that the policies detailed in this statement be adhered to. You should be aware that stock market surveillance techniques are becoming more sophisticated all the time, and the chance that authorities will detect and prosecute even small-level trading is significant. Even an SEC investigation that does not result in prosecution can tarnish one s reputation and damage a career. 

8. Compliance with Policy; Reporting of Possible Violations 

The Company expects strict compliance with this Policy by all employees and directors. Although this Policy is expressly not intended to result in the imposition of additional legal liability that would not otherwise exist, failure to observe these procedures will be considered an extremely serious matter and may be grounds for appropriate disciplinary action, including termination of employment. 
 
 All persons subject to this Policy shall take appropriate measures to restrict access to and disclosure of material non-public information. In the event you become aware of possible insider trading violations, you should immediately contact the Company s Stock Compliance Officer, or such other individual designated by the Stock Compliance Officer, at generalcounsel@rdus.com. 
 5 

Anonymous reporting violations or perceived violations may be made through the Company's Misconduct Reporting System. 
 
 Neither this Policy nor any policy of the Company, and notwithstanding any other confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement (whether in writing or otherwise, including without limitation as part of an employment agreement, separation agreement or similar employment or compensation arrangement) applicable to current or former employees or directors, should be deemed to restrict any current or former employee or director from communicating, cooperating or filing a complaint with any U.S. federal, state or local governmental or law enforcement branch, agency or entity (collectively, a Governmental Entity with respect to possible violations of any U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation, or otherwise making disclosures to any Governmental Entity, in each case, that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of any such law or regulation, provided that (1) in each case such communications and disclosures are consistent with applicable law and (2) the information subject to such disclosure was not obtained by the current or former employee or director through a communication that was subject to the attorney-client privilege, unless such disclosure of that information would otherwise be permitted by an attorney pursuant to 17 CFR 205.3(d)(2), applicable state attorney conduct rules, or otherwise. Any agreement in conflict with the foregoing is hereby deemed amended by the Company to be consistent with the foregoing. 
 
 III. Stock Trading by Directors, Officers and Other Insiders 

All directors, executive officers, and other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries designated as insiders by the Company or the Stock Compliance Officer because of their regular access to material non-public information (a Restricted Person are required to comply with the following insider trading rules, in addition to the general policy regarding stock trading applicable to all employees and directors. To the extent the rules in this Policy are inconsistent with the general policy, these rules shall prevail. 
 
 1. Pre-Clearance of Transactions in the Company s Securities 

To help prevent inadvertent violations of the U.S. securities laws and avoid even the appearance of trading on material, non-public information, Restricted Persons may not engage in any transaction involving the Company s stock (including any gifts, loans, contributions to a trust or other transfers, whether the transaction is for the individual s own account, one over which he or she exercises control or one in which he or she has a beneficial interest) without first certifying that such transaction will be conducted in compliance with the provisions of this Policy and obtaining the Stock Compliance Officer s pre-clearance of the transaction. A request for pre-clearance must be submitted using the form provided on SharePoint in advance of the proposed transaction. Approval for transactions will generally be granted only outside of a closed-window period (as described below), and the transaction may only be performed outside of a closed-window period within two business days from the date of the approval, provided that notwithstanding receipt of pre-clearance, you may not trade in Company securities if you subsequently become aware of material, non-public information prior to effecting the transaction. The Stock Compliance Officer is under no obligation to approve a transaction submitted for 
 6 

pre-clearance and may determine not to permit the transaction. Notwithstanding any pre-clearance of a transaction, the Company assumes no liability for the consequences of any transaction. 
 
 2. Rule 10b5-1 Plans 

A 10b5-1 Plan is a binding, written contract between you and your broker that specifies the price, amount, and date of trades to be executed in your account in the future, or provides a formula or mechanism that your broker will follow, and satisfies various other conditions and limitations set forth in Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. A 10b5-1 Plan can only be established when you do not possess material nonpublic information. Therefore, you cannot enter into these plans at any time when in possession of material, non-public information and, in addition, Restricted Persons cannot enter into these plans when a closed-window period is in effect. In addition, a 10b5-1 Plan must not permit you to exercise any subsequent influence over how, when, or whether the purchases or sales are made. 
 
 You must pre-clear with the Stock Compliance Officer any 10b5-1 Plans prior to establishing, amending or terminating such plan, and all 10b5-1 Plans must use a Company-approved template that can be requested from the Stock Compliance Officer. The Company reserves the right to withhold pre-clearance of the adoption, amendment or termination of any such trading plan that the Company determines is not consistent with the rules regarding such plans. Additionally, any modification or termination of a pre-approved 10b5-1 Plan requires pre-clearance by the Stock Compliance Officer. Additional requirements include: 
 
 No Fast Selling and No Sales Outside of the Plan 10b5-1 Plans should be designed to cause a number of smaller sales over time to minimize the appearance of sales timed with material, non-public information. While a Plan is in effect sales generally should not be made outside of the Plan, especially in large concentrations during a short time period. 

Terminations If a 10b5-1 Plan is terminated before the end of its stated term, the individual may not adopt a new Plan for 180 days, and no trades outside of a Plan may be made for at least 60 days. 

Duration of Plan 10b5-1 Plans must have a minimum duration of six months and a maximum of two years. 

3. Closed-Window Periods 

(a) Quarterly Closed-Window Periods 

The Company s announcement of quarterly financial results almost always has the potential to have a material effect on the market for the Company s stock. Therefore, to avoid even the appearance of trading while aware of material, non-public information, Restricted Persons generally will not be permitted to trade in the Company s stock during the period beginning at the close of business on the 15th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter of the Company and ending after one full trading day following the release of quarterly or annual results for the prior fiscal quarter or year by the Company. 
 
 (b) Event-Specific Closed-Window Periods 

7 

From time to time, an event may occur that is material to the Company and which is known by only a few directors, executive officers and other employees. For so long as the event remains material and non-public, directors, executive officers and other employees designated by the Stock Compliance Officer may not trade in the Company s stock. The existence of an event-specific closed-window will not be announced other than to those who are already aware of the event giving rise to the closed-window. A Restricted Person who requests pre-clearance to trade in the Company s stock during an event-specific closed-window period will be informed by the Stock Compliance Officer of the existence of the event-specific closed-window period without an explanation for the reason behind the event-specific closed-window period. Any person made aware of the existence of an event-specific closed-window period should not disclose the existence of the closed-window for any reason. The failure of the Stock Compliance Officer to designate a person as being subject to an event-specific closed-window shall not relieve that person of the obligation not to trade while aware of material non-public information. 
 
 4. Hardship Exemption 

Transactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons (such as the need to raise money for an emergency expenditure) are no exception to the basic policy described above. The U.S. securities laws do not recognize such mitigating circumstances, and even the appearance of an improper transaction must be avoided to preserve the Company s reputation for adhering to stringent standards of conduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company s Stock Compliance Officer may, on a case-by-case basis, authorize trading in the Company stock during a closed-window period due to financial hardship or other hardships only after 
 
 a. the person wishing to trade has notified the Company s Stock Compliance Officer in writing (which writing may be in the form of e-mail) of the circumstances of the hardship and the amount and nature of the proposed trade(s); and 
 
 b. the person wishing to trade has certified to the Company s Stock Compliance Officer in writing no earlier than two business days prior to the proposed trade(s) that he or she is not in possession of material non-public information concerning the Company. The existence of the foregoing approval procedures does not in any way obligate the Company s Stock Compliance Officer to approve any trades requested by Restricted Persons as hardship applicants. The Company s Stock Compliance Officer may reject any trading requests at his/her sole discretion. Hardship exemptions are granted infrequently and only in exceptional circumstances. 
 
 5. Termination of Employment or Office 

The restrictions set forth in this Policy apply to Restricted Persons following the termination of their employment or term of office, as applicable, for such period as the Stock Compliance Officer shall determine such person is likely to be in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company. 
 
 6. Broker Requirements for Section 16 Persons 

8 

The timely reporting of transactions requires tight interface with brokers handling transactions for the Company s directors and executive officers. A knowledgeable, alert broker can also serve as a gatekeeper, helping to ensure compliance with the Company s pre-clearance procedures and helping prevent inadvertent violations. Therefore, in order to facilitate timely compliance by the Company s directors and executive officers Section 16 Persons with the requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, brokers of Section 16 Persons need to comply with the following requirements: 
 
 (a) To not enter any order (except for orders under pre-approved Rule 10b5-1 plans) without first verifying with the Company that your transaction was pre-cleared and complying with the brokerage firm s compliance procedures (e.g., Rule 144); and 
 
 (b) To report before the close of business on the day of the execution of the transaction to the Company by telephone and in writing via e-mail to the Stock Compliance Officer the complete (i.e., date, type of transaction, number of shares and price) details of every transaction involving the Company s equity securities, including gifts, transfers and all transactions under 10b5-1 and other trading plans. 
 
 Because it is the legal obligation of the trading person to cause any filings on Form 3, Form 4, Form 5 or Form 144 (or as otherwise be required) to be made, Section 16 Persons are strongly encouraged to confirm following any transaction that your broker has immediately telephoned and e-mailed the required information to the Company. 
 
 7. Consultation with Stock Compliance Officer 

Because there are so many gray areas in the law of insider trading, you should not try to make close calls about what is legal or illegal by yourself. Err on the side of caution: either refrain from trading altogether if there is any question in your mind about the propriety of a particular trade, even if it is proposed to take place outside of a closed-window period, or consult with the Stock Compliance Officer with respect to a particular trade prior to execution. Remember, however, the ultimate responsibility for adhering to this Policy and avoiding improper transactions rests with you. It is imperative that you use your best judgment. 
 
 8. Transactions by the Stock Compliance Officer 

In the case of a proposed transaction in the Company s stock by the Stock Compliance Officer, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company shall take such actions as are usually required of the Stock Compliance Officer hereunder. 
 
 9. Compliance with Procedures 

The Company expects strict compliance with these procedures by all Restricted Persons. Although this Policy is expressly not intended to result in the imposition of additional legal liability that would not otherwise exist, failure to observe these procedures will be considered an extremely serious matter and may be grounds for appropriate disciplinary action, including termination of employment. 
 
 9 

IV. Company Transactions 

From time to time, the Company may engage in transactions in Company securities. It is the Company s policy to comply with all applicable securities laws when engaging in transactions in Company securities.

Exhibit 97.1 

 RADIUS RECYCLING 
 Incentive Compensation Clawback Policy 
 (As Adopted on November 10, 2023 Pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5608) 
 1. Overview . The Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board of Radius Recycling (the Company has adopted this Incentive Compensation Clawback Policy (the Policy which requires the recoupment of certain incentive-based compensation in accordance with the terms herein and is intended to comply with Listing Rule 5608, as promulgated by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, as such rule may be amended from time to time (the Listing Rules ). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms under Section 12 of this Policy. 

2. Interpretation and Administration . The Committee shall have full authority to interpret and enforce the Policy; provided, however, that the Policy shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with its intent to meet the requirements of the Listing Rules. As further set forth in Section 10 below, this Policy is intended to supplement any other clawback policies and procedures that the Company may have in place from time to time pursuant to other applicable law, plans, policies or agreements. 

3. Covered Executives . The Policy applies to each current and former Executive Officer of the Company who serves or served as an Executive O cer at any time during a performance period in respect of which Incentive Compensation is Received, to the extent that any portion of such Incentive Compensation is (a) Received by the Executive Officer during the last three completed Fiscal Years or any applicable Transition Period preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement (regardless of whether any such Restatement is actually filed) and (b) determined to have included Erroneously Awarded Compensation. For purposes of determining the relevant recovery period referenced in the preceding clause (a), the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement under the Policy is the earlier to occur of (i) the date that the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement. For the sake of clarity, recovery of Incentive Compensation Received prior to becoming an Executive Officer is not required under this Policy, although Incentive Compensation Received during the performance period by former Executive Officers is covered. Executive Officers subject to this Policy pursuant to this Section 3 are referred to herein as Covered Executives . 

4. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation . If any Erroneously Awarded Compensation is Received by a Covered Executive, the Company shall reasonably promptly take steps to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in a manner described under Section 5 of this Policy. 

5. Forms of Recovery . The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion and in a manner that effectuates the purpose of the Listing Rules, one or more method for recovering any 

Erroneously Awarded Compensation hereunder in accordance with Section 4 above, which may include, without limitation: (a) requiring cash reimbursement; (b) seeking recovery or forfeiture of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer or other disposition of any equity-based awards; (c) offsetting the amount to be recouped from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive; (d) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; or (e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Committee. To the extent the Covered Executive refuses to pay to the Company an amount equal to the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the Company shall have the right to sue for repayment and/or enforce the Covered Executive s obligation to make payment through the reduction or cancellation of outstanding and future compensation. Any reduction, cancellation or forfeiture of compensation shall be done in compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 

6. No Indemnification . The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation for which the Committee has determined to seek recoupment pursuant to this Policy. 

7. Exceptions to the Recovery Requirement . Notwithstanding anything in this Policy to the contrary, Erroneously Awarded Compensation need not be recovered pursuant to this Policy if the Committee (or, if the Committee is not composed solely of Independent Directors, a majority of the Independent Directors serving on the Board) determines that recovery would be impracticable as a result of any of the following: 

(a) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered; provided that, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the Exchange; or 

(b) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and the regulations thereunder. 

8. Committee Determination Final . Any determination by the Committee with respect to the Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested parties. 

9. Amendment . The Policy may be amended by the Committee from time to time, to the extent permitted under the Listing Rules. 

10. Non-Exclusivity . Nothing in the Policy shall be viewed as limiting the right of the Company or the Committee to pursue additional remedies or recoupment under or as required by any similar policy adopted by the Company or under the Company s compensation plans, award agreements, employment agreements or similar agreements or the applicable provisions of any law, rule or regulation which may require or permit recoupment to a greater degree or with respect to additional compensation as compared to this Policy (but without duplication as to any 

2 		 

recoupment already made with respect to Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this Policy). This Policy shall be interpreted in all respects to comply with the Listing Rules. 

11. Successors . The Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. 

12. Defined Terms . 

Covered Executives shall have the meaning set forth in Section 3 of this Policy. 
 Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall mean the amount of Incentive Compensation actually Received that exceeds the amount of Incentive Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, and computed without regard to any taxes paid. For Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded Incentive Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement: 
 (A) The calculation of Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive Compensation was Received; and 

(B) The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Exchange. 

Exchange shall mean The Nasdaq Stock Market. 
 Executive Officer shall mean the Company s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive officers of the Company s parent(s) or subsidiaries shall be deemed executive officers of the Company if they perform such policy-making functions for the Company. This definition of Executive Officer aligns with the definition of officer under Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 Financial Reporting Measures shall mean measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, including, without limitation, stock price and total shareholder return (in each case, regardless of whether such measures are presented within the Company s financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission). 
 Fiscal Year shall mean the Company s fiscal year; provided that a Transition Period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months will be deemed a completed fiscal year. 
 3 		 

Incentive Compensation shall mean any compensation (whether cash or equity-based) that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure, and may include, but shall not be limited to, performance bonuses and long-term incentive awards such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units or other equity-based awards. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive Compensation does not include (i) awards that are granted, earned and vested exclusively upon completion of a specified employment period, without any performance condition, and (ii) bonus awards that are discretionary or based on subjective goals or goals unrelated to Financial Reporting Measures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compensation amounts shall not be considered Incentive Compensation for purposes of the Policy unless such compensation is Received (1) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association and (2) on or after October 2, 2023, the effective date of the Listing Rules. 
 Independent Director shall mean a director who is determined by the Board to be independent for Board or Committee membership, as applicable, under the rules of the Exchange, as of any determination date. 
 Listing Rules shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1 of this Policy. 
 Incentive Compensation shall be deemed Received in the Company s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period. 
 Restatement shall mean an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the Company s previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to as Big R restatements), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as little r restatements). 
 Transition Period shall mean any transition period that results from a change in the Company s Fiscal Year within or immediately following the three completed Fiscal Years immediately preceding the Company s requirement to prepare a Restatement. 
 
 Adopted on: November 10, 2023
