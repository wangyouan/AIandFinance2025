 PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General First Savings Financial Group, Inc., an Indiana corporation, was incorporated in May 2008 and serves as the holding company for First Savings Bank (the Bank or First Savings Bank ). First Savings Financial Group s principal business activity is the ownership of the outstanding common stock of First Savings Bank. First Savings Financial Group does not own or lease any property but instead uses the premises, equipment and other property of First Savings Bank with the payment of appropriate rental fees, as required by applicable law and regulations, under the terms of an expense allocation agreement. Accordingly, the information set forth in this annual report including the consolidated financial statements and related financial data contained herein, relates primarily to the Bank. First Savings Bank converted from a federally-chartered savings bank to an Indiana-chartered commercial bank and became a member the Federal Reserve System effective December 19, 2014. As a result of the Bank s charter conversion, First Savings Financial Group converted to a bank holding company and simultaneously elected financial holding company status effective December 19, 2014. First Savings Bank operates as a community-oriented financial institution offering traditional financial services to consumers and businesses in its primary market area. We attract deposits from the general public and use those funds to originate primarily residential and commercial mortgage loans. We also originate commercial business loans, residential and commercial construction loans, multi-family loans, land and land development loans, and consumer loans. We conduct our lending and deposit activities primarily with individuals and small businesses in our primary market area, except as otherwise discussed herein. Our website address is www.fsbbank.net. Information on our website is not, and should not be considered a part of, this annual report. Market Area We are located in South Central Indiana along the axis of Interstate 65 and Interstate 64, directly across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. We consider Clark, Floyd, Harrison, Crawford, Washington and Daviess counties, Indiana, in which all of our offices are located, and the surrounding areas to be our primary market area. The current top employment sectors in these counties are the private retail, service and manufacturing industries, which are likely to continue to be supported by the projected growth in population and median household income. These counties are well-served by barge transportation, rail service, and commercial and general aviation services, including the United Parcel Service s major hub, which are located in our primary market area. Competition We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the several financial institutions operating in our primary market area and from other financial service companies such as securities and mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions and insurance companies. We also face competition for investors funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. At June 30, 2024, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the FDIC, we held approximately 33.22 , 18.12 , 2.23 , 23.80 , 100.00 and 28.74 of the FDIC-insured deposits in Clark, Daviess, Floyd, Harrison, Crawford and Washington Counties, Indiana, respectively. This data does not reflect deposits held by credit unions with which we also compete. In addition, banks owned by large national and regional holding companies and other community-based banks also operate in our primary market area. Some of these institutions are larger than us and, therefore, may have greater resources. Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our primary market area and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies, mortgage brokers and credit unions. Competition for loans also comes from non-depository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies, and specialty and captive finance companies.

Table of Contents 
 We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowing banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet, and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Changes in federal law now permit affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future. Lending Activities Consistent with the Bank s conversion to an Indiana-chartered commercial bank in December 2014, the Bank is continuing the process of transforming the composition of its balance sheet from that of a traditional thrift institution to that of a commercial bank. We intend to continue to emphasize residential lending, primarily secured by owner-occupied properties, but also to continue concentrating on ways to expand our consumer/retail banking capabilities and our commercial banking services with a focus on serving small businesses and emphasizing relationship banking in our primary market area. The largest segments of our loan portfolio are single tenant net lease and residential real estate mortgage loans, which are primarily one- to four-family residential loans, and, to a lesser extent, commercial real estate and commercial business loans. We also originate residential and commercial construction loans, land and land development loans, and consumer loans. We generally originate loans for investment purposes, although, depending on the interest rate environment and our asset/liability management goals, we may sell into the secondary market the 25-year and 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate, as well as the portion of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA that we originate under its 7(a) program. We do not offer, have not offered and have not purchased or acquired Alt-A, sub-prime or no-documentation loans. One- to Four-Family Residential Loans. Our origination of residential mortgage loans enables borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes located in Clark, Floyd, Harrison, Crawford, Washington and Daviess Counties, Indiana, and the surrounding areas. Our residential lending policies and procedures conform to the secondary market guidelines. We generally offer a mix of adjustable-rate mortgage loans and fixed-rate mortgage loans with terms of 10 to 30 years. Borrower demand for adjustable-rate loans compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to an initially discounted interest rate and loan fees for multi-year adjustable-rate mortgages. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us based on our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally adjust annually after an initial fixed period that typically ranges from one to five years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate typically equal to a margin above the one year U.S. Treasury index. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally one percentage point per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally six percentage points over the initial interest rate of the loan. However, a portion of the adjustable-rate mortgage loan portfolio has a maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased of two percentage points per adjustment period and a lifetime interest rate cap generally of six percentage points over the initial interest rate of the loan. While one- to four-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans on a regular basis. We do not offer loans with negative amortization and generally do not offer interest-only loans.

Table of Contents 
 We generally do not originate conventional loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80 , including that for non-owner occupied residential real estate loans whose loan-to-value ratios generally may not exceed 75 , or 65 where the borrower has more than five non-owner occupied loans outstanding. Loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80 generally require private mortgage insurance. However, the total balance of residential mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 90 amounted to 17.2 million, of which some do not have private mortgage insurance or government guaranty. We generally require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a board-approved independent appraiser. We also generally require title insurance on all first mortgage loans with principal balances of 250,000 or more. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for all loans located in flood hazard areas. Commercial Real Estate Loans. We offer fixed and adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by small to moderately-sized office, retail and industrial properties located in our primary market area and are typically made to small business owners and professionals such as attorneys and accountants. We originate fixed-rate commercial real estate loans, generally with terms up to five years and payments based on an amortization schedule of 15 to 20 years, resulting in balloon balances at maturity. We also offer adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans, generally with terms up to five years and with interest rates typically equal to a margin above the prime lending rate or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Loans are secured by first mortgages, generally are originated with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80 and often require specified debt service coverage ratios depending on the characteristics of the project. Rates and other terms on such loans generally depend on our assessment of credit risk after considering such factors as the borrower s financial condition and credit history, loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage ratio and other factors. During 2013, we began a commercial real estate lending program that is focused on loans to high net worth individuals that are secured by low loan-to-value, single-tenant commercial properties that are generally leased to investment grade national-brand retailers, the borrowers and collateral properties for which are outside of our primary market area NNN Finance Program ). This program is designed to diversify the Company s geographic and credit risk profile given the geographic dispersion of the loans and collateral, and the investment grade credit of the national-brand lessees. The terms of the loans are generally consistent with the aforementioned terms of in-market commercial real estate loans; however, these cannot exceed 70 loan-to-value and loan maturities cannot exceed the expiration of the underlying leases. In addition, the Company has established guidelines with respect to concentrations by state, lessee and industry of lessees as a percentage of regulatory capital. The average size of these loans originated was 1.8 million and the portfolio balance was 750.6 million at September 30, 2024. Construction Loans. We originate construction loans for one to four family homes and commercial properties such as small industrial buildings, warehouses, retail shops and office units. Construction loans, including speculative construction loans to builders who have not identified a buyer or lessee for the completed property at the time of origination, are made to a limited group of well-established builders in our primary market area and we limit the number of projects with each builder. Construction loans are typically for a term of 12 months with monthly interest only payments and interest rates on these loans are generally tied to the prime lending rate. Except for speculative construction loans, repayment of construction loans typically comes from the proceeds of a permanent mortgage loan for which a commitment is typically in place when the construction loan is originated. Occasionally, a speculative construction loan may be converted to a permanent loan if the builder has not secured a buyer within a limited period of time after the completion of the home. We also offer construction loans for the financing of pre-sold homes, which convert into permanent loans at the end of the construction period. Such loans generally have a six month construction period with interest only payments due monthly, followed by an automatic conversion to a 15 year to 30 year permanent loan with monthly payments of principal and interest. Construction loans, other than land development loans, generally will not exceed the lesser of 80 of the appraised value or 90 of the direct costs, excluding items such as developer fees, operating deficits or other items that do not relate to the direct development of the project. We require a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80 for speculative construction loans. Generally, commercial construction loans require the personal guarantee of the owners of the business. We generally disburse funds on a percentage-of-completion basis following an inspection by a third party inspector.

Table of Contents 
 Land and Land Development Loans. On a limited basis, we originate loans to developers for the purpose of developing vacant land in our primary market area, typically for residential subdivisions. Land development loans are generally interest-only loans for a term of 18 to 24 months. We generally require a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75 of the appraisal market value upon completion of the project. We generally do not require any cash equity from the borrower if there is sufficient indicated equity in the collateral property. Development plats and cost verification documents are required from borrowers before approving and closing the loan. Our loan officers are required to personally visit the proposed development site and the sites of competing developments. We also originate loans to individuals secured by undeveloped land held for investment purposes. Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. We offer multi-family mortgage loans that are generally secured by properties in our primary market area. Multi-family loans are secured by first mortgages and generally are originated with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80 and generally require specified debt service coverage ratios depending on the characteristics of the project. Rates and other terms on such loans generally depend on our assessment of the credit risk after considering such factors as the borrower s financial condition and credit history, loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage ratio and other factors. Consumer Loans. Although we offer a variety of consumer loans, our consumer loan portfolio consists primarily of home equity loans, both fixed rate amortizing term loans with terms up to 15 years and adjustable rate lines of credit with interest rates equal to a margin above the prime lending rate. We also offer auto and truck loans, personal loans and small boat loans. Consumer loans typically have shorter maturities and higher interest rates than traditional one-to four-family lending. We typically do not make home equity loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 90 , including any first mortgage loan balance. The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. Commercial Business Loans. We typically offer commercial business loans to small businesses located in our primary market area. Commercial business loans are generally secured by equipment and general business assets. Key loan terms and covenants vary depending on the collateral, the borrower s financial condition, credit history and other relevant factors, and personal guarantees are typically required as part of the loan commitment. Loan Underwriting Risks Adjustable Rate Loans. While we anticipate that adjustable rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed rate mortgages, an increased monthly mortgage payment required of adjustable rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. Non-Owner Occupied Residential Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by rental properties represent a unique credit risk to us and, as a result, we adhere to special underwriting guidelines. Of primary concern in non-owner occupied real estate lending is the consistency of rental income of the property. Payments on loans secured by rental properties often depend on the maintenance of the property and the payment of rent by its tenants. Payments on loans secured by rental properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on rental properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements and we consider and review a rental income cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property. We generally require collateral on these loans to be a first mortgage along with an assignment of rents and leases. If the borrower holds loans on more than four rental properties, a loan officer or collection officer is generally required to inspect these properties annually to determine if they are being properly maintained and rented. We have generally limited these loan relationships to an aggregate total of 500,000.

Table of Contents 
 Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in multi-family and commercial real estate lending is the borrower s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements on multi-family and commercial real estate loans. In addition, some loans may contain covenants regarding ongoing cash flow coverage requirements. In reaching a decision on whether to make a multi-family or commercial real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property. An environmental survey or environmental risk insurance is obtained when the possibility exists that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials. Construction and Land and Land Development Loans. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the building. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a building having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment if liquidation is required. If we are forced to foreclose on a building before or at completion due to a default, we may be unable to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, speculative construction loans, which are loans made to home builders who, at the time of loan origination, have not yet secured an end buyer for the home under construction, typically carry higher risks than those associated with traditional construction loans. These increased risks arise because of the risk that there will be inadequate demand to ensure the sale of the property within an acceptable time. As a result, in addition to the risks associated with traditional construction loans, speculative construction loans carry the added risk that the builder will have to pay the property taxes and other carrying costs of the property until an end buyer is found. Land and land development loans have substantially similar risks to speculative construction loans. Consumer Loans. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as motor vehicles and boats. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In the case of home equity loans, real estate values may be reduced to a level that is insufficient to cover the outstanding loan balance after accounting for the first mortgage loan balance. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. Commercial Business Loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from his or her employment income or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. Loan Originations, Sales and Purchases. Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary sources of loan originations are existing customers, walk-in traffic, advertising, and referrals from customers and centers of influence, such as real estate agents, attorneys, accountants and other professionals. We generally do not sell whole loans, other than long-term fixed rate residential mortgage loans that we originate, or participation interests in loans originated by us. We also generally do not purchase whole loans or participation interests in loans originated by other financial institutions. However, in order to manage certain risk factors or supplement our lending portfolio, we may sell or purchase whole loans or participation interests in loans from time to time depending on various factors. At September 30, 2024, loans totaling 154.8 million included sold participation interests of 103.9 million, for a net position of 50.9 million outstanding in our portfolio. At September 30, 2024, acquired participation interests totaled 37.5 million.

 Beginning in April 2015, the Bank hired a management team, business development officers (loan officers), underwriters and supporting staff that are seasoned and experienced in SBA lending in order to enhance the Company s proficiency in SBA 7(a) program loan originations and sales. The Bank continues to hire additional business development officers and appropriate supporting staff in order to grow this lending platform. The primary purpose of this lending platform is to originate SBA 7(a) program loans, the borrowers and collateral for which are outside of our primary market area, and sell the amounts guaranteed by the SBA in the secondary market. This lending platform is also designed to diversify the Company s geographic and interest rate risk profile with respect to the retained unguaranteed amounts given the geographic dispersion of the loans and collateral, and their floating rate structure. The Company originated SBA loans with a total commitment of 79.3 million during the year ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, 299.7 million of SBA loans included sold guaranteed portions of 194.4 million, for a net position of 105.3 million outstanding in our portfolio. All SBA loans held for sale were carried at the lower of cost or fair market value at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Mortgage Banking. Beginning in April 2018, the Bank hired a management team, business development officers (loan officers), underwriters and supporting staff that are seasoned and experienced in the origination and sale of one- to four-family residential real estate loans on a nationwide basis. The primary purpose of this lending platform is to originate one- to four-family residential real estate loans, the borrowers and collateral for which are outside of our primary market area, and sell the whole loans in the secondary market. The Company originated 60.8 million and sold 83.2 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans within this lending platform during the year ended September 30, 2024. The were no outstanding one- to four-family residential real estate loans within the lending platform in the Bank s portfolio at September 30, 2024. In October 2023, the Company announced the Board of Directors decision to wind down the Bank s residential mortgage banking operations, which was completed during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The Bank continues to offer residential mortgage lending in its primary market areas. Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our conventional lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management. Certain of our employees have been granted individual lending limits, which vary depending on the individual, the type of loan and whether the loan is secured or unsecured. Generally, all loan requests for non-SBA 7(a) program lending relationships that exceed the individual officer lending limits, which is generally 300,000 secured or 25,000 unsecured, require committee or Board of Directors approval. Loans resulting in aggregated lending relationships in excess of individual officer lending limits but less than 10.0 million require approval by the Officer Loan Committee and loans resulting in aggregated lending relationships in excess of 10.0 million but less than 14.0 million require approval of the Board Credit Committee. The Board Credit Committee consists of the President and three independent Board members, and the Officer Loan Committee consists of members of senior management and certain other officers designated by the Board of Directors. Loans resulting in aggregated lending relationships in excess of 14.0 million require approval by the Board of Directors. Our SBA 7(a) program lending activities also follow underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management. Certain of our employees have been granted individual lending limits, which is 2.0 million for the aggregate loan balance, of which 75 or greater is guaranteed by the SBA. Generally, all SBA 7(a) program loan requests for lending relationships that exceed the individual officer lending limits require approval by the SBA Officer Loan Committee. The SBA Officer Loan Committee consists of the President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief of Credit Administration, Chief of SBA Lending. The aggregated lending relationships for the SBA 7(a) program may not exceed 5.0 million according to SBA guidelines and therefore no loan requests require approval by the Board of Directors given that the portion of SBA 7(a) program loans that are not guaranteed by the SBA may not exceed 1.25 million. Loans to One Borrower. The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower s related entities is limited, by regulation, to generally 15 of our stated capital and reserves. At September 30, 2024, our regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was 36.3 million. At that date, our largest lending relationship was for a commitment of 29.0 million, of which 20.0 million was outstanding, and was performing according to its original terms at that date. Loan Commitments. We issue commitments for commercial loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers. Generally, our loan commitments expire after 30 days. See Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this annual report for additional information regarding our loan commitments at September 30, 2024.

 Investment Activities We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various U.S. government agencies and sponsored enterprises, securities of various state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. Within certain regulatory limits, we also may invest a portion of our assets in other permissible securities. As a member of the Federal Reserve System and Federal Home Loan Bank System, in particular a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis FHLB ), First Savings Bank is also required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB. At September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. Treasury notes, government agency and sponsored enterprises securities, mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by U.S. government agencies and sponsored enterprises, municipal bonds, privately-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities, and pass-through asset-backed securities guaranteed by the SBA. Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, and to provide an alternate source of low-risk investments at a favorable return when loan demand is weak. Our Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of the investment policy. Messrs. Myers, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Schoen, our Chief Financial Officer, are responsible for implementation of the investment policy and monitoring our investment performance. Our Board of Directors reviews the status of our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if warranted. Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds General. Deposits, borrowings, and loan and investment security repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows, loan prepayments and investment security calls are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Deposit Accounts. Deposits are attracted from within our primary market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), regular savings accounts and time deposits. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability to us, matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing weekly. Our deposit pricing strategy has typically been to offer competitive rates on all types of deposit products, and to periodically offer special rates in order to attract deposits of a specific type or term. Borrowings. We use advances from the FHLB to supplement our investable funds. First Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. First Savings Bank, as a member of the FHLB, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB and is authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of the U.S., U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the FHLB s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness. We have four federal funds purchased line of credit facilities with other financial institutions that are subject to continued borrower eligibility and are intended to support short-term liquidity needs. We also utilize brokered certificates of deposit and reciprocal time deposits as sources of borrowings and may use broker repurchase agreements and internet certificates of deposit from time to time, depending on our liquidity needs and pricing of these facilities versus other funding alternatives.

 Employees and Human Capital Resources We believe that the success of a business is largely due to the quality of its employees, the development of each employee s full potential, and the Company s ability to provide timely and satisfying rewards. We encourage and support the development of our employees and, whenever possible, strive to fill vacancies from within. We invest in learning and development including tuition reimbursement for courses, degree programs and fees paid for certifications. As of September 30, 2024, we had 250 full-time employees and 24 part-time employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining unit. Subsidiaries The Company has one wholly-owned subsidiary, First Savings Bank. The Bank has three subsidiaries, Q2 Business Capital, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company specializing in the origination and servicing of SBA loans, First Savings Investments, Inc., a Nevada corporation that manages a securities portfolio, and Southern Indiana Financial Corporation, an independent insurance agency, offering various types of annuities and life insurance policies. Southern Indiana Financial Corporation is currently inactive. REGULATION AND SUPERVISION General First Savings Bank, as an Indiana commercial bank, is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions INDFI ). As a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, First Savings Bank s primary federal regulator is the Federal Reserve Board FRB ). First Savings Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. First Savings Bank must file reports with its regulatory agencies concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the INDFI and FRB to evaluate First Savings Bank s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the Deposit Insurance Fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of an adequate allowance for credit losses for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the INDFI, FRB, or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on First Savings Financial Group and First Savings Bank and their operations. Certain of the regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to First Savings Bank and First Savings Financial Group are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on First Savings Bank and First Savings Financial Group. Regulation of First Savings Bank Business Activities. The activities of Indiana-chartered banks, such as First Savings Bank, are governed by Indiana and federal laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations delineate the nature and extent of the business activities in which banks may engage. Federal law generally limits the activities as principal and equity investments of FDIC insured state banks to those permitted for national banks. Activities as principal of state bank subsidiaries are also limited to those permitted for subsidiaries of national banks, absent regulatory approval for a particular subsidiary activity. In addition, federal law limits the authority of Federal Reserve System member banks, such as First Savings Bank, to purchase investment securities. Generally, such authority is limited to investment securities permissible for national banks, which includes investment grade, marketable debt obligations. Certain activities, such as the establishment of new branches and mergers and acquisitions, require the prior approval of both the INDFI and the FRB. Loans to One Borrower. Indiana law establishes limits on a bank s loans to one borrower. Generally, subject to certain exceptions, an Indiana bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15 of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10 of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable collateral. These limits are similar to those applicable to First Savings Bank under its previous federal savings bank charter.

 Capital Requirements . Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions, including state chartered Federal Reserve System member banks, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets of 8 and a 4 Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. As noted, the capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , 6 and 8 , respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4 Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI ), up to 45 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0 is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50 is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100 is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150 is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0 to 600 is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions by the institution and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was 2.50 for 2024 and 2023. The Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The FRB has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of the particular risks or circumstances. As of September 30, 2024, First Savings Bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements in effect at that date. Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The law requires that certain supervisory actions be taken against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends on the degree of undercapitalization. The FRB has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation as to state member banks. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or greater. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5 or greater. An institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 . An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 . An institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . Subject to a narrow exception, a receiver or conservator is required to be appointed for an institution that is critically undercapitalized within specified time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FRB 

 11 

Table of Contents 
 within 45 days of the date an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. Compliance with the plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company up to the lesser of 5 of the institution s total assets when it was deemed to be undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve compliance with applicable capital requirements. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The FRB could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures. Insurance of Deposit Accounts. First Savings Bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Currently, deposit insurance per account owner is 250,000. Under the FDIC s existing risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain specified adjustments. The assessment rates (inclusive of adjustments) currently range from two and one half to 45 basis points of total capital less tangible assets, depending upon the particular institution s risk category. The rate schedules will automatically adjust in the future when the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches certain milestones. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15 of estimated insured deposits to 1.35 of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC adopted a plan to restore the fund to the 1.35 ratio by September 30, 2028. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of First Savings Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FRB or FDIC. The management of First Savings Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. Limitation on Dividends. Indiana law authorizes a bank s board of directors to declare dividends out of profits as deemed expedient. However, application to and the prior approval of the INDFI and FRB is required before payment of a dividend if total dividends for the calendar year exceed net income for the year to date plus the amount of retained net income for the preceding two years. Federal law specifies that a bank may not pay a dividend if it fails to satisfy any applicable federal capital requirement after the dividend. If First Savings Bank s capital ever fell below its regulatory requirements or the FRB notified it that it was in need of increased supervision, its ability to pay dividends or otherwise make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the INDFI and/or FRB could prohibit a proposed capital distribution, which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the regulator determined that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking agencies have adopted Interagency Guidelines prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness in various areas such as internal controls and information systems, internal audit, loan documentation and credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the FRB determines that a state member bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the FRB may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Community Reinvestment Act. All federally-insured banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution s failure to satisfactorily comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could result in denials of regulatory applications. First Savings Bank received a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed examination.

 Transactions with Related Parties. Federal law limits First Savings Bank s authority to engage in transactions with affiliates e.g ., any entity that controls or is under common control with First Savings Bank, including First Savings Financial Group and its other subsidiaries). The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10 of the capital and surplus of a bank. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20 of a bank s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type specified by federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must generally be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by First Savings Financial Group to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, First Savings Bank s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10 shareholders insiders ), as well as entities such persons control, is limited. The laws limit both the individual and aggregate amount of loans that First Savings Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on First Savings Bank s capital level and requires that certain board approval procedures be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved. Enforcement. The INDFI maintains enforcement authority over First Savings Bank, including the power to issue cease and desist orders and civil money penalties and remove directors, officers or employees. The INDFI also has the power to appoint a conservator or receiver for a bank upon insolvency, imminent insolvency, unsafe or unsound condition or certain other situations. The FRB has primary federal enforcement responsibility over Federal Reserve System member state banks and has authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including shareholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on the bank. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to 25,000 per day, or even 1 million per day in especially egregious cases. The FDIC, as deposit insurer, has the authority to recommend to the FRB that enforcement action be taken with respect to a member bank. If action is not taken by the FRB, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. In general, regulatory enforcement actions occur with respect to situations involving unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, violations of law or regulation or breaches of fiduciary duty. Federal and Indiana law also establish criminal penalties for certain violations. Assessments. Indiana banks are required to pay assessments to the INDFI to fund the agency s operations. The assessments paid to the INDFI by First Savings Bank for the year ended September 30, 2024 totaled 129,000. Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. First Savings Bank, as a member of the FHLB, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. First Savings Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB capital stock of 23.1 million at September 30, 2024. Federal Reserve Board System. The FRB regulations require banks to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). On March 26, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB reduced the reserve requirement to zero, and the requirement remained at zero at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Other Regulations First Savings Bank s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, including the: Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

 13 

Table of Contents 
 Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 
 The operations of First Savings Bank also are subject to laws such as the: Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21 ), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check. 
 Holding Company Regulation General. As a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, First Savings Financial Group is subject to FRB regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over First Savings Financial Group and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to First Savings Bank. The INDFI also has examination and enforcement authority since First Savings Financial Group controls an Indiana bank. As a bank holding company, First Savings Financial Group is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any other bank or bank holding company. Prior FRB approval is required for any bank holding company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the acquiring bank holding company would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5 of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In addition to the approval of the FRB, prior approval may for such acquisitions also be necessary from other agencies including the INDFI and agencies that regulate the target. A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in nonbanking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5 of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being well capitalized and well managed, to opt to become a financial holding company and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. First Savings Financial Group elected to become a financial holding company because of the former activities of the Captive. Bank holding companies are generally subject to consolidated capital requirements established by the FRB. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to amend its consolidated minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies to make them no less stringent than those applicable to insured depository institutions themselves. The FRB s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine.

Table of Contents 
 A bank holding company is generally required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or violate any law, regulation, FRB order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be limited if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The guidance also provides for regulatory consultation prior to a bank holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or where the redemption or repurchase of common or preferred stock cause a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding at the end of a quarter compared to the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of First Savings Financial Group to pay dividends, repurchase shares of its stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. The status of First Savings Financial Group as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. Acquisition of Control. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as First Savings Financial Group unless the FRB has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25 of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10 of any class of a bank holding company s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, is the case with First Savings Financial Group, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Indiana law requires INDFI approval for changes in control of companies controlling Indiana banks, with control defined to mean power to direct the management or policies of the holding company or power to vote at least 25 of the company s voting securities. Federal Securities Laws First Savings Financial Group s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. First Savings Financial Group is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. TAXATION Federal Income Taxation General. We report our income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The federal income tax laws apply to us in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly our reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us. First Savings Financial Group and First Savings Bank have entered into a tax allocation agreement.

For fiscal years beginning before June 30, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code, as the Bank did prior to its conversion to a commercial bank in December 2014, were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for nonqualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after 1995 and required savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves. Approximately 4.6 million of our accumulated bad debt reserves would not be recaptured into taxable income unless First Savings Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to First Savings Financial Group as described below. Distributions. If First Savings Bank makes non-dividend distributions to First Savings Financial Group, the distributions will be considered to have been made from First Savings Bank s unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves, including the balance of its reserves as of September 30, 1988, to the extent of the non-dividend distributions, and then from First Savings Bank s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an amount based on the amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in First Savings Bank s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of First Savings Bank s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of First Savings Bank s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in First Savings Bank s taxable income. The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if First Savings Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to First Savings Financial Group, approximately one and one-quarter times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21 federal corporate income tax rate. First Savings Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves. State Taxation Indiana. Effective July 1, 2013, Indiana amended its tax code to provide for reductions in the franchise tax rate. For the Company s tax year ended September 30, 2023, Indiana imposed a 5.00 franchise tax based on a financial institution s adjusted gross income as defined by statute. The Indiana franchise tax rate was reduced to 4.90 for the Company s tax years ending September 30, 2024 and years thereafter. In computing Indiana taxable income, deductions for municipal interest, state and local income taxes and certain accelerated depreciation permitted for federal tax purposes are disallowed. The Company and its subsidiaries also file income and franchise tax returns in various other states where they are deemed to have tax nexus. The Company s Indiana tax returns for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2021 were audited by the Indiana Department of Revenue. These audits were closed during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Our other state income tax returns have not been audited during the last five years.

 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect First Savings Financial Group s consolidated financial condition and results of operations and an investment in its securities. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect us. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in a decrease in earnings or material losses. Risks Related to Our Lending Activities Our emphasis on commercial real estate lending and commercial business lending may expose us to increased lending risks. At September 30, 2024, 1.15 billion, or 58.2 , of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans. Subject to market conditions, we intend to increase our origination of these loans. Commercial real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Commercial real estate loans also typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers both at origination and at maturity because many of our commercial real estate loans are not fully-amortizing, but result in balloon balances at maturity. Commercial business loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower s business and are secured by non-real estate collateral that may depreciate over time. In addition, some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship may expose us to a greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. At September 30, 2024, nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled 8.8 million. At September 30, 2024 nonperforming commercial business loans totaled 3.2 million. For more information about the credit risk we face, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management. Our construction loan and land and land development loan portfolios may expose us to increased credit risk. At September 30, 2024, 80.1 million, or 4.0 of our loan portfolio consisted of construction loans, and land and land development loans, and 6.4 million, or 10.2 of the construction loan portfolio (excluding undisbursed commitments and portions participated to other financial institutions), consisted of speculative construction loans at that date. Speculative construction loans are loans made to builders who have not identified a buyer for the completed property at the time of loan origination. Subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to emphasize the origination of construction loans and land and land development loans. These loan types generally expose a lender to greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential mortgage loans because the repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operation or sale of the property and the income stream of the borrowers and such loans typically involve larger balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. In addition, many borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us so an adverse development with respect to one loan or credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of non-payment and loss. Furthermore, we may need to increase our allowance for credit losses through future charges to income as the portfolio of these types of loans grows, which would adversely affect our earnings. For more information about the credit risk we face, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management. Our concentration in non-owner occupied residential real estate loans may expose us to increased credit risk. At September 30, 2024, 24.9 million, or 3.7 of our residential mortgage loan portfolio and 1.3 of our total loan portfolio, consisted of loans secured by non-owner occupied residential properties. Loans secured by non-owner occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured by owner occupied properties because repayment of such loans depend primarily on the tenant s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties is often below that of owner occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which has a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. Furthermore, some of our non-owner occupied residential loan borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. At September 30, 2024, we had four non-owner 

 17 

Table of Contents 
 occupied residential loan relationships, each having an outstanding balance over 500,000, with aggregate outstanding balances of 6.8 million. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one credit relationship may expose us to a greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to an owner occupied residential mortgage loan. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had three nonperforming non-owner occupied residential loans totaling 157,000. At September 30, 2024, the Bank did not have any non-owner occupied residential properties held as real estate owned. For more information about the credit risk we face, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management. We may suffer losses in our loan portfolio despite our underwriting practices. Our results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Lending money is an essential part of the banking business. However, borrowers do not always repay their loans. The risk of non-payment is historically small, but if nonpayment levels are greater than anticipated, our earnings and overall financial condition, as well as the value of our common stock, could be adversely affected. No assurance can be given that our underwriting practices or monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks. Loan losses can cause insolvency and failure of a financial institution and, in such an event, our stockholders could lose their entire investment. In addition, future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. For more information about the credit risk we face, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management. Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses. Like all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for credit losses for loans to provide for current expected credit losses due to loan defaults, non-performance, and other qualitative factors. Our allowance for credit losses for loans is based on our historical loss experience as well as an evaluation of the risks associated with our loan portfolio, including the size and composition of the loan portfolio, loan portfolio performance, fair value of collateral securing the loans, current and forecasted economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. Similarly, we maintain an allowance for credit losses for securities to provide for current expected credit losses due to payment defaults or significant adverse financial performance of the issuer. Our allowance for credit losses for securities may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses on securities, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. For more information about our analysis and determination of allowance for credit losses, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management. Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the federal government and we face specific risks associated with originating SBA loans. Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the federal government. As an SBA Preferred Lender, we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of the lender s Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as a Preferred Lender, we may lose some or all of our customers to lenders who are SBA Preferred Lenders. Also, any changes to the SBA program, including changes to the level of guarantee provided by the federal government on SBA loans, could adversely affect our business and earnings. We generally sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) program loans in the secondary market. These sales have resulted in premium income for us at the time of sale and created a stream of future servicing income. We may not be able to continue originating these loans or selling them in the secondary market. Furthermore, even if we are able to continue originating and selling SBA 7(a) program loans in the secondary market, we might not continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portion of these loans. When we sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) program loans, we incur credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans, and if a customer defaults on the non-guaranteed portion of a loan, we share any loss and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA. If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by us, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us, which could adversely affect our business and earnings.

 The laws, regulations and standard operating procedures that are applicable to SBA loan products may change in the future. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, changes in the laws, regulations and procedures applicable to SBA loans could adversely affect our business and earnings. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances. When residential mortgage loans are sold, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. We may be required to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach certain representations or warranties in connection with the sale of such loans. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase, are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which would lead to lower revenue, higher loan losses and lower earnings. Recessionary conditions and/or continued negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and increased unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition. The value of our residential mortgage loan servicing rights and SBA loan servicing rights is subjective by nature and may be vulnerable to inaccuracies or other events outside our control. The value of our loan servicing rights can fluctuate. The assets could decrease if prepayment speeds or delinquency rates of the underlying loans increase, or if the costs to service the loans increase. The value of the assets could also decline if there is a lack of liquidity in the loan servicing rights market. Similarly, the value may decrease if interest rates decrease or change in a non-parallel manner or are otherwise volatile. All of these factors are largely out of our control. Estimates must be developed and assumptions and judgments must be made when valuing these assets. An inaccurate valuation, or changes to the valuation due to factors outside of our control, could negatively impact our ability to realize the full value of these assets. As a result, our balance sheet may not precisely represent the fair market value of these and other financial assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no residential loans mortgage loan servicing rights due to the wind down of the national mortgage banking operation and subsequent sale of the residential mortgage loan servicing rights portfolio, which was completed during the year ended September 30, 2024.

 Risks Related to Competition Strong competition within our primary market area could hurt our profits and slow growth. We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and attract deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which would reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits. At June 30, 2024, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the FDIC, we held approximately 33.22 , 18.12 , 2.23 , 23.80 , 100.00 and 28.74 of the FDIC-insured deposits in Clark, Daviess, Floyd, Harrison, Crawford and Washington Counties, Indiana, respectively. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our primary market area. See Item 1. Business Market Area and Item 1. Business Competition for more information about our primary market area and the competition we face. Risks Related to Changes in Market Interest Rates Changing interest rates may hurt our earnings and asset value. Our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investments less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding. Changes in interest rates up or down could adversely affect our net interest margin and, as a result, our net interest income. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up. Changes in the slope of the yield curve or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, as it has in recent years, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. Also, interest rate decreases can lead to increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk as we may have to redeploy such repayment proceeds into lower yielding loans or investments, which would likely hurt our income. At September 30, 2024, approximately 977.3 million, or 49.3 of the total loan portfolio, consisted of fixed-rate loans with maturity dates after September 30, 2025. This investment in fixed-rate loans exposes the Company to increased levels of interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets, and in particular our securities portfolio. Generally, the value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity. Conversely, the value of MSRs generally increases when market interest rates increase. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Interest Rate Risk Management. Inflation can have an adverse impact on our business and on our customers. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. In recent years, there have been market indicators of a pronounced rise in inflation and the Federal Reserve Board has raised certain benchmark interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. As inflation increases, the value of our investment securities, particularly those with longer maturities, would decrease, although this effect can be less pronounced for floating rate instruments. In addition, inflation increases the cost of goods and services we use in our business operations, such as electricity and other utilities, which increases our noninterest expenses. Furthermore, our customers are also affected by inflation and the rising costs of goods and services used in their households and businesses, which could have a negative impact on their ability to repay their loans with us.

 Risks Related to Our Liquidity Position Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition. Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Risks Related to Mergers and Acquisitions and Other Expansionary Activities Market expansion and acquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties and dilution to existing shareholder value. We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future, and we may engage in de novo branch expansion. We may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services. We may incur substantial costs to expand, and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek. There can be no assurance that integration efforts for any mergers or acquisitions will be successful. Also, we may issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders. There is no assurance that, following any mergers or acquisitions, our integration efforts will be successful or that, after giving effect to the acquisition, we will achieve profits comparable to, or better than, our historical experience. Market expansion and acquisitions involve a number of expenses and risks, including but not limited to: the time and costs of associated with identifying and evaluating potential new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion; the time and costs associated with identifying potential acquisition and merger targets; the accuracy of the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to a target institution; the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combined businesses; our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders; closing delays and expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by shareholders of targets; entry into new markets where we lack experience; introduction of new products and services into our business; the risk of loss of key employees and customers; and incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on our results of operations. 
 Future acquisitions could be material to the Company and it may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholder s ownership interests.

 If the goodwill that we recorded in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could have a significant negative impact on our profitability. Goodwill represents the amount of consideration exchanged over the fair value of net assets we acquired in the purchase of another financial institution. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset might be impaired. At September 30, 2024, our goodwill totaled 9.8 million. While we have recorded no such impairment charges since we initially recorded the goodwill, there can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Investment Portfolio If additional provisions for credit losses are recorded in connection with our investment portfolio it could have a significant negative impact on our profitability. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprises securities, mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by U.S. government agencies and sponsored enterprises, municipal bonds, and privately-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities. We must evaluate these securities for credit losses on a periodic basis. The privately-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities exhibit signs of weakness, which may necessitate a provision for credit loss in the future should the financial condition of the pools deteriorate further. Any future provisions for credit losses on securities could have a significant adverse effect our earnings. Risks Related to Our Operations Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company and Bank, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to our reputation. A disruption, failure in or breach, including cyber-attacks, of our operational, communications, information or security systems, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business and face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Any failure or interruption of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure or interruption of these information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions of these information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 We rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take numerous protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks and those of our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact and result in significant losses by us and/or our customers. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties, such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or the threats may originate from within our organization. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified. We are inherently exposed to risks caused by the use of computer, internet and telecommunications systems, and susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses to us or our clients, privacy breaches against our clients or damage to our reputation. These risks include fraud by employees, customers and other outside entities targeting us and/or our customers, and such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including internet fraud, check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, and other dishonest acts. In recent periods, there has been a rise in electronic fraudulent activity within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector, due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity in recent periods. Given such increase in electronic fraudulent activity and the growing level of use of electronic, internet-based and networked systems to conduct business directly or indirectly with our clients, certain fraud losses may not be avoidable regardless of the preventative and detection systems in place. Although, to date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the outsourcing of some of our business operations and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. We maintain an insurance policy which we believe provides sufficient coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, we cannot assure that this policy will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third party s systems failing or experiencing attack. We operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the INDFI, its chartering authority, the FRB, its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as insurer of its deposits. The Company is also subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of the Company s common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for credit losses. If our regulators require us to charge-off loans or increase our allowance for credit losses, our earnings would suffer. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.

 The Dodd-Frank Act has created a new federal agency to administer consumer protection and fair lending laws, a function that was formerly performed by the depository institution regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various other provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions including the implementation of more stringent capital adequacy rules. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business and operations will not be known for years until regulations implementing the statute are written and adopted. The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs. Any future legislative changes could have a material impact on our profitability, the value of assets held for investment or collateral for loans. Future legislative changes could require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and potentially expose us to additional costs, liabilities, enforcement action and reputational risk. In addition to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal regulatory agencies have taken stronger supervisory actions against financial institutions that have experienced increased loan losses and other weaknesses as a result of the recent economic crisis. The actions include entering into written agreements and cease and desist orders that place certain limitations on operations. Federal bank regulators have also been using with more frequency their ability to impose individual minimum capital requirements on banks, which requirements may be higher than those required under the Dodd-Frank Act or that would otherwise qualify a bank as being well capitalized under applicable prompt corrective action regulations. If we were to become subject to a regulatory agreement or higher individual minimum capital requirements, such action may have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business plan, as well as our ability to grow, pay dividends or engage in mergers and acquisitions and may result in restrictions in our operations. For a further discussion, see Item 1. Business Regulation and Supervision. We rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect our operations, and we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. We are a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. We expect our future growth to be driven in a large part by the relationships maintained with our customers by our executive and other senior officers. Although we are party to non-compete and non-solicitation agreements with certain executive, senior and other officers, the unexpected loss of any of our key employees could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The implementation of our business strategy will also require us to continue to attract, hire, motivate and retain skilled personnel to develop new customer relationships as well as new financial products and services. The market for qualified employees in the businesses in which we operate is competitive and we may not be successful in attracting, hiring or retaining key personnel. Our inability to attract, hire or retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock Our ability to pay dividends is subject to certain limitations and restrictions, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue paying the same level of dividends in the future that we paid in 2024 or that we will be able to pay future dividends at all. Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the FRB regarding capital adequacy and dividends, other regulatory restrictions, and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company is subject to regulation by the INDFI, applicable Indiana law and the FRB, and is limited by the Bank s obligations to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity. In addition, banking regulators may propose guidelines seeking greater liquidity and regulations requiring greater capital requirements. If such new regulatory requirements were not met, the Bank would not be able to pay dividends to the Company, and consequently we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.

 The trading volume of our stock varies and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them. The price of the common stock purchased may decrease significantly. Although our common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol FSFG , trading activity in the stock historically has been sporadic. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of liquidity and order depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers at any given time. The presence of willing buyers and sellers depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic conditions, all of which are beyond our control. Insiders have substantial control over us, and this control may limit our shareholders ability to influence corporate matters and may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control over us. As of December 6, 2024, our directors, executive officers, and their related entities and persons currently beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 15.32 of our outstanding common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. In addition, these shareholders will be able to exercise influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change in control would benefit our other shareholders. For information regarding the ownership of our outstanding stock by our directors, executive officers, and their related entities and persons, see Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters .

 Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION Overview Income. Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Other significant sources of pre-tax income are service charges (mostly from service charges on deposit accounts and loan servicing fees), ATM and interchange fees on debit and credit cards, increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance, income from sales of residential mortgage and SBA loans originated for sale in the secondary market, commissions on sales of securities and insurance products, and real estate lease income. We also recognize income from the sale of investment securities. Allowance for Credit Losses. On October 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which replaced the previously required incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. The ACL is increased by provision expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged off. The Company s policy is to charge off all or a portion of a loan when, in management s opinion, it is unlikely to collect the principal amount owed in full either through payments from the borrower or a guarantor or from the liquidation of the collateral. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this annual report for additional information regarding the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses. Expenses. The noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses, occupancy expenses, data processing expenses, professional service fees, federal deposit insurance premiums, advertising, net losses on foreclosed real estate and other miscellaneous expenses. Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries, wages and incentive compensation paid to our employees; payroll taxes; and expenses for health insurance, retirement plans and other employee benefits. We also recognize annual employee compensation expenses related to our equity incentive plans as the equity incentive awards vest. Occupancy expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of depreciation charges, furniture and equipment expenses, maintenance, real estate taxes, office lease expense and costs of utilities. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to 40 years. Data processing expenses are the fees we pay to third parties for processing customer information, deposits and loans. Professional fees expense represents the fees we pay to third parties for legal, accounting, investment advisory and other consulting services. Federal deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the FDIC to insure of our deposit accounts. Other expenses include expenses for office supplies, postage, telephone, insurance, regulatory assessments and other miscellaneous operating expenses. Critical Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding reported results. Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made; and different estimates that the Company reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements. These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices, and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under generally accepted accounting principles. Significant accounting policies, including the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The policies considered to be the critical accounting policies are described below.

Table of Contents 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for credit losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current and forecasted economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this annual report for additional information regarding the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses. Goodwill Valuation. Goodwill is recognized when the fair value of consideration transferred in an acquisition is greater than the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the excess is allocated to goodwill. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated on at least an annual basis for potential impairment, and more often if circumstances warrant more frequent evaluations. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value. Significant judgment and assumptions are utilized by management in the impairment analysis. The Company performs its annual qualitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30 of each year, but considering the recent economic conditions of the current year, the Company performed a Step 1 goodwill impairment test (which compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill) during the third fiscal quarter of 2024, and the results indicated that there was no impairment. The Company continued to evaluate the economic conditions for applicable changes and at September 30, 2024, there was no impairment of goodwill. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this annual report for additional information. Deferred Tax Assets . Income tax expense involves estimates related to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers the likelihood that sufficient taxable income of appropriate character will be generated within carryback and carryforward periods, including consideration of available tax planning strategies. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this annual report for additional information.

The average balance of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased 8.0 million, or 2.2 , from 368.2 million for 2023 to 376.2 million for 2024, and the average cost of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings increased from 2.92 for 2023 to 3.35 for 2024. Average other borrowings, which is comprised of subordinated debt, decreased 10.6 million or 17.9 from 59.2 million for 2023 to 48.5 million for 2024. The average cost of other borrowings increased from 5.48 for 2023, net of amortization of debt issuance costs, to 6.63 for 2024, net of amortization of debt issuance costs. In 2023, total interest expense increased 31.1 million or 296.3 , due primarily to an increase in the average cost of funds from 0.80 for 2022 to 2.44 for 2023, and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of 385.7 million, from 1.32 billion for 2022 to 1.71 billion for 2023. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased 292.2 million, or 29.5 , from 990.3 million for 2022 to 1.28 billion for 2023, and the average cost of funds for deposits was 0.49 for 2022 compared to 2.16 for 2023.

 Average Balances and Yields. The following tables present information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances only. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans and totaled 1.1 million, 1.2 million and 1.5 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Tax exempt income on loans and investment securities has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using a federal marginal tax rate of 21.0 . There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be excluded from the following table.

The Company recognized a provision for credit losses for loans of 3.5 million, a credit for unfunded lending commitments of 421,000, and a provision for credit losses for securities of 21,000 for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision for loan losses of 2.6 million only for 2023. The provision for credit losses for loans increased primarily due to loan growth and the effects of adopting the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology during 2024. Net charge-offs in 2024 were 527,000 compared to 1.1 million for 2023 and nonperforming loans increased 3.0 million to 16.9 million at September 30, 2024. In 2023, the Company recognized a provision for loan losses of 2.6 million compared to a provision for loan losses of 1.9 million for 2022. Net charge-offs in 2023 were 1.1 million compared to 849,000 for 2022 and nonperforming loans increased 3.1 million to 13.9 million at September 30, 2023. See Analysis of Nonperforming and Classified Assets included herein. It is management s assessment that the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 was adequate and appropriately reflected the current expected losses in the Bank s loan portfolio at that date. Noninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased 12.8 million, or 50.6 , from 25.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 to 12.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was due primarily to a 14.1 million decrease in mortgage banking income due to the wind down of the Company s national mortgage banking operations in 2024. Mortgage loans originated for sale were 60.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 587.7 million for 2023. In 2023, noninterest income decreased 25.9 million, or 50.5 , from 51.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 to 25.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a 24.0 million decrease in mortgage banking income in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in mortgage banking income was primarily due to lower origination and sales volume in 2023 compared to 2022. Mortgage loans originated for sale were 587.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 1.61 billion for 2022.

 Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expenses decreased 23.2 million, or 30.5 , from 76.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 to 52.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was due primarily to decreases in compensation and benefits, data processing expense and other operating expenses of 12.0 million, 2.2 million and 7.8 million, respectively. The decrease in compensation and benefits expense was due primarily to a reduction in staffing related to the wind down of the Company s national mortgage banking operations in the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in data processing expense was due primarily to expenses recognized in the prior year related to the implementation of the new core operating system in August 2023. The decrease in other operating expense was due primarily to a 1.9 million decrease in net loss on captive insurance operations due to the dissolution of the captive insurance company in September 2023; a decrease in loss contingency accrual for SBA-guaranteed loans of 754,000 in 2024 compared to an increase of 1.5 million in 2023; a decrease in the loss contingency accrual for restitution to mortgage borrowers of 283,000 in 2024 compared to an increase of 609,000 in 2023; and a decrease of 853,000 in loan expense for 2024 as compared to 2023 due primarily to lower mortgage loan originations related to the cessation of national mortgage banking operations in the quarter ended December 31, 2023. In 2023, noninterest expenses decreased 16.5 million, or 17.8 , from 92.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 to 76.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in compensation and benefits and professional fees of 17.3 million and 3.7 million, respectively, partially offset by a 2.2 million increase in data processing expense. The decrease in compensation and benefits expense was due primarily to a reduction in staff and incentive compensation for the Company s mortgage banking segment as a result of decreased mortgage banking volume. The decrease in professional fees was due primarily to a 2.0 million consulting fee incurred in 2022 in connection with negotiating a new core processing contract. The increase in data processing expense is primarily due to one-time charges totaling 1.4 million in connection with the conversion of the Bank s data processing system. Income Tax Expense. The Company recognized income tax expense of 1.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023 and 1.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The effective tax rate was 7.0 , 0.1 and 11.1 , for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for 2024 compared to 2023, was primarily due to higher taxable income in the 2024 period. The lower effective tax rate for 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily due to the recognition of investment tax credits related to solar projects in 2023 and lower pre-tax income in 2023 as compared to 2022. The lower pre-tax income for 2023 is due primarily to losses incurred for mortgage banking operations, professional fees related to mortgage banking loss contingencies, and expenses related to the conversion of the Bank s data processing system. Risk Management Overview. Managing risk is essential to successfully managing a financial institution. Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as available-for-sale securities that are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Other risks that we face are operational risks, liquidity risks and reputation risk. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, technology and disaster recovery. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors, lenders or borrowers. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue or in the value of our common stock. The Company has implemented an enterprise risk management structure in order to better manage and mitigate these identified and perceived risks. Credit Risk Management. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans.

 When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. When the loan becomes 15 days past due, a late notice is sent to the borrower and a late fee is assessed. When the loan becomes 30 days past due, a more formal letter is sent. Between 15 and 30 days past due, telephone calls are also made to the borrower. After 30 days, we regard the borrower as in default. The borrower may be sent a letter from our attorney and we may commence collection proceedings. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure. Generally, when a consumer loan becomes 60 days past due, we institute collection proceedings and attempt to repossess any personal property that secures the loan. Generally, we institute foreclosure proceedings when a loan is 60 days past due. Management obtains the approval of the Board of Directors to proceed with foreclosure of property. Management informs the Board of Directors monthly of all loans in nonaccrual status, all loans in foreclosure and all repossessed property and assets that we own. Analysis of Nonperforming and Classified Assets. We consider nonaccrual loans, financial difficulty modifications FDMs ), repossessed assets and loans that are 90 days or more past due to be nonperforming assets. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days delinquent at which time the accrual of interest ceases and the allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations. Typically, payments received on a nonaccrual loan are first applied to the outstanding principal balance. Real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned until it is sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at its fair market value, less estimated costs to sell, at the date of foreclosure. Holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income. Former bank premises held for sale are also included in other real estate owned, but are not included in the nonperforming asset totals below. The following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. Included in nonperforming loans are loans for which the Bank has modified the repayment terms, and therefore are considered to be FDMs. There were no new FDMs made or modifications of existing FDMs during the year ended September 30, 2024.

In addition, the Bank s regulators have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. Substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution, without establishment of a specific allowance or charge-off, is not warranted. The regulations also provide for a special mention category, described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention. When we classify an asset as doubtful we may establish a specific allowance for credit losses. If we classify an asset as loss, we charge off an amount equal to 100 of the portion of the asset classified loss.

Table of Contents 
 Classified assets include loans that are classified due to factors other than payment delinquencies, such as lack of current financial statements and other required documentation, insufficient cash flows or other deficiencies, and, therefore, are not included as nonperforming assets. Other than as disclosed in the above tables, there are no other loans where management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. Classified assets also include investment securities that have experienced a downgrade of the security s credit quality rating by various rating agencies. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 effective October 1, 2023. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this annual report for additional information regarding the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses. The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for credit losses by loan category at the dates indicated.

The banking regulators may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses based on judgments different from ours. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for credit losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for credit losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings. To reduce the potential volatility of our earnings, we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates, while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread. Our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes: adjusting the maturities of borrowings; adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration and generally selling in the secondary market substantially all newly originated, fixed rate one-to four-family residential real estate loans. We currently do not participate in hedging programs, interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments, other than the use of forward mortgage loan sale contracts in connection with our mortgage banking activities. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this annual report for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments. We have an Asset/Liability Management Committee, which includes members of management selected by the Board of Directors, to communicate, coordinate and control all aspects involving asset/liability management. The committee establishes and monitors the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals. Our goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income. Market Risk Analysis. An element in our ongoing interest rate risk management process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a Net Interest Income at Risk simulation to model the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet and to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on the Company. The model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income over a one-year horizon. The model assumes a semi-static balance sheet and measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of hypothetical changes in interest rates over twelve months and provides no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movements. The scenarios include prepayment assumptions, changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, and spreads between market interest rates in order to capture the impact from re-pricing, yield curve, option, and basis risks.

 Results of our simulation modeling, which assumes an immediate and sustained parallel shift in market interest rates, project that the Company s net interest income could change as follows over a one-year horizon, relative to our base case scenario, based on September 30, 2024 and 2023 financial information. The simulated changes presented in the following table are within policy guidelines approved by the Company s Board of Directors. 

At September 30, 2024 At September 30, 2023 Immediate Change One Year Horizon One Year Horizon in the Level Dollar Percent Dollar Percent of Interest Rates Change Change Change Change (Dollars in thousands) 300bp (6,833) (10.11) (6,660) (11.71) 200bp (4,475) (6.62) (4,349) (7.65) 100bp (2,486) (3.68) (2,223) (3.91) Static (100)bp 3,209 4.75 2,214 3.89 (200)bp 6,339 9.38 4,451 7.83 At September 30, 2024, our simulated exposure to an increase in interest rates shows that an immediate and sustained increase in rates of 1.00 will decrease our net interest income by 2.5 million or 3.68 over a one year horizon compared to a flat interest rate scenario. Furthermore, rate increases of 2.00 and 3.00 would cause net interest income to decrease by 6.62 and 10.11 , respectively. An immediate and sustained decrease in rates of 1.00 and 2.00 would increase our net interest income by 3.2 million and 6.3 million, or 4.75 and 9.38 , respectively, over a one year horizon compared to a flat interest rate scenario. The Company also has longer term interest rate risk exposure, which may not be appropriately measured by Net Interest Income at Risk modeling, and therefore uses an Economic Value of Equity EVE interest rate sensitivity analysis in order to evaluate the impact of its interest rate risk on earnings and capital. This is measured by computing the changes in net EVE for its cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. EVE modeling involves discounting present values of all cash flows for on and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios and provides no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movements. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents the Company s EVE and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with adjustments made for off-balance sheet items. The amount of base case EVE and its sensitivity to shifts in interest rates provide a measure of the longer term re-pricing and option risk in the balance sheet. Results of our simulation modeling, which assumes an immediate and sustained parallel shift in market interest rates, project that the Company s EVE could change as follows, relative to our base case scenario, based on September 30, 2024 and 2023 financial information. The simulated changes presented in the following table are not within policy guidelines approved by the Company s Board of Directors due to the strategic decision to attempt to enhance the Company s profile in the declining rate scenarios.

At September 30, 2023 Immediate Change Economic Value of Equity Economic Value of Equity as a in the Level Dollar Dollar Percent Percent of Present Value of Assets of Interest Rates Amount Change Change EVE Ratio Change (Dollars in thousands) 300bp 168,287 (103,095) (37.99) 8.80 (386) bp 200bp 200,335 (71,047) (26.18) 10.10 (256) bp 100bp 234,422 (36,960) (13.62) 11.38 (128) bp Static 271,382 12.66 bp (100)bp 309,457 38,075 14.03 13.87 121 bp (200)bp 348,979 77,597 28.59 15.00 234 bp The previous table indicates that at September 30, 2024, the Company would expect a decrease in its EVE in the event of a sudden and sustained 100, 200 and 300 basis point increase in prevailing interest rates, and an increase in its EVE in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 and 200 basis point decrease in prevailing interest rates. The models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect the Company s net interest income and EVE. For this reason, we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand its overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes. Therefore, as with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables and it is recognized that the model outputs are not guarantees of actual results. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Liquidity Management. Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future short-term financial obligations. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the FHLB. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank regularly adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon its assessment of (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management policy. The Bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 52.1 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, amounting to 248.7 million, at September 30, 2024, provide additional sources of liquidity. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately 800.0 million from the FHLB, of which 301.6 million was borrowed and outstanding. In addition, we had the ability to borrow the lesser of 20 million or 25 of the Bank s equity capital, excluding reserves, using a federal funds purchased line of credit facility with another financial institution at September 30, 2024. We also had three other federal funds line of credit facilities with other financial institutions from which we had the ability to borrow the lesser of 5.0 million or 50 of the Bank s equity capital, 22 million and 15 million, respectively. The Bank did not have any outstanding federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had 325.8 million in commitments to extend credit outstanding. Time deposits due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled 780.6 million, or 96.0 of time deposits. We believe the large percentage of time deposits that mature within one year reflects customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods due to the recent higher interest rate environment and local competitive pressure. The balance also includes 509.2 million in brokered and reciprocal time deposits at September 30, 2024. If these maturing time deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the time deposits due on or before September 30, 2025. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of our time deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.

 The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay its operating expenses and other financial obligations, to pay any dividends and to repurchase any of its outstanding common stock. The Company s primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. The amount of dividends that the Bank may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year, without the receipt of prior approval from banking regulators, cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income (as defined) for the preceding two calendar years. At September 30, 2024, the Company had liquid assets of 4.2 million on a stand-alone, unconsolidated basis. Our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities. Our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts and FHLB borrowings. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors. We generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive. Occasionally, we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits. Capital Management. The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements. The Bank is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Item 1. Business Regulation and Supervision Regulation of Federal Savings Associations Capital Requirement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For the year ended September 30, 2024, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this annual report have been prepared according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. Item 7A.

 Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act ). Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. (b) Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. The system of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the consolidated financial statements is evaluated for effectiveness by management. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed First Savings Financial Group, Inc. s system of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting as described in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective and met the criteria of the Internal Control Integrated Framework. (c) Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except with respect to our remediation actions described below, the Company did not materially change its internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and made no changes that it believes are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. Remediation of Material Weaknesses As previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company determined that material weaknesses existed as of September 30, 2023 in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses that management identified were the following: The Company did not maintain effective controls over the review of the allowance for loan losses calculation, including appropriate precision of management review of qualitative factors. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the design and operation of the monthly and quarterly closing routines. Specifically, inappropriate assignment of administrator access for multiple significant information technology

 applications, lack of requirements for review of manual journal entries, timing and frequency of certain general ledger account reconciliations, precision and accuracy of management period end financial statement review process, and inappropriate documentation to support performance of closing routines including completion of a disclosure checklist. 
 Remediation Plan and Status Through the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company implemented remediation measures with respect to these material weaknesses. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, management concluded that each material weakness identified above was remediated. A material weakness will not be considered fully remediated until the enhanced controls related to that material weakness are fully implemented and operate for a sufficient period and management has concluded that these controls are operating effectively. To remediate these material weaknesses, the Company implemented the following measures as it relates to each: The Company did not maintain effective controls over the review of the allowance for loan losses calculation, including appropriate precision of management review of qualitative factors. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company engaged a nationally recognized third party consultant to assist in performing a gap analysis of the control environment and enhancing the documentation and operation of controls related to the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, management refined the documentation supporting the qualitative factor adjustments, and enhanced the level of detail and precision with which the management reviews of the qualitative factors was conducted. This was accomplished through improving the Company s internal control documentation and adding a second management level review of the ACL calculation, including the qualitative factors. The Company s remediation steps outlined above strengthened its internal control over financial reporting. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company successfully tested its enhanced internal policies and controls regarding the review of the allowance for credit losses function. As a result, management concluded that it had remediated the material weakness relating to the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the design and operation of the monthly and quarterly closing routines. Specifically, inappropriate assignment of administrator access for multiple significant information technology applications, lack of requirements for review of manual journal entries, timing and frequency of certain general ledger account reconciliations, precision and accuracy of management period end financial statement review process, and inappropriate documentation to support performance of closing routines including completion of a disclosure checklist. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company engaged a nationally recognized third party consultant to assist in performing a gap analysis of the control environment and enhancing the documentation and operation of controls related to financial reporting. Additionally, management improved the monthly and quarterly closing routines and modified the timing and frequency of general ledger account reconciliations and review of the reconciliations with a greater emphasis on quarter end dates. Management also enhanced the review and documentation of manual journal entries and improved the review process of the quarterly analytical review by adding an additional layer of executive management to the process. Finally, certain members of financial management have developed and completed quarterly checklists and disclosure checklists are now being completed on a quarterly basis. The Company s remediation steps outlined above strengthened its internal control over financial reporting. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company successfully tested its enhanced internal polices and controls regarding the monthly and quarterly closing function. As a result, management concluded that it had remediated the material weakness relating to the monthly and quarterly closing routines as of September 30, 2024. Item 9B. OTHER INFORMATION During the three months ended September 30, 2024, of the Company s directors or executive officers or any , instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of the Company s securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of SEC Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such term is defined in Item 408 of SEC Regulation S-K).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 13, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective October 1, 2023 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

 Allowance for Credit Losses As described in Notes 1 and 4, the Company s allowance for credit losses (ACL) on loans was 21.3 million at September 30, 2024. The ACL is an estimate of current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The determination of the ACL requires significant judgment reflecting the Company s best estimate of expected future losses for the loan portfolio s entire contractual term adjusted for expected prepayments. In calculating the ACL, the loan portfolio is segmented into pools based upon similar risk characteristics. Management measures expected credit losses over the life of each loan pool utilizing a weighted average remaining maturity loss methodology model. The model primarily utilized historical internal and peer loss rates applied to the estimated remaining life of each pool. The model is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts of relevant macroeconomic factors including U.S. national unemployment rate, consumer price index and gross domestic product. A one-year forecast period for these factors is utilized, with loss rates then reverting to their historic average. Additional qualitative adjustments are applied for risk factors that are not considered within the modeling process but are relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan pools. We identified the valuation of the ACL as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for that determination included the high degree of judgment and subjectivity involved in evaluating management s estimates, particularly as it relates to evaluating management s assessment of the qualitative factors. The primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter included: Obtained an understanding of the Company s process for establishing the ACL, including model selection and the qualitative factor adjustments of the ACL. Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls relating to management s determination of the ACL, including controls over: 
 o Management s review of identification and relevance of qualitative factors utilized in the ACL, and the reasonableness of the related adjustment scale of the qualitative factor component of the ACL. o Management s review of the relevance, reliability and accuracy of the underlying data inputs, judgments, and calculations used to determine the historical loss rates and qualitative adjustments to historic loss rates. 
 Evaluated management s determination of historical loss rates and peer loss rates utilized to calculate the quantitative components of the ACL calculation. Evaluated the reasonableness of management s application of qualitative factor adjustments to historical loss rates in the ACL, including: 
 o Evaluating the reasonableness of management s significant assumptions, judgments, and conclusions related to the application of the qualitative adjustments. Our evaluation considered the weight of evidence from internal and external sources and loan portfolio composition and performance. o Testing the relevance and reliability of data inputs and mathematical accuracy of the qualitative adjustments to historical loss rates.

 (1 continued) Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses - continued for individually evaluated loans unless further analysis in the future suggests a change is needed to this threshold based on the credit environment at that time. For collateral dependent financial assets where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the financial asset to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the asset as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the financial asset exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the financial asset exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated cost to sell. The allowance for credit losses may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. If the loan is not collateral dependent, the measurement of loss is based on the difference between the expected and contractual future cash flows of the loan. Management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a loan modification with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably expected loan modification, the Company factors the reasonably-expected loan modification into the current expected credit losses estimate. The Company has identified the following portfolio segments and measures and adjusts the ACL using the following methods: Residential real estate Residential real estate loans represent loans to consumers for the financing of a residence. Our residential lending policies and procedures conform to the secondary market guidelines, utilizing underwriting processes that rely on empirical data to assess credit risk as well as analysis of the borrower s ability to repay their obligations, credit history, the amount of any down payment and the market value or other characteristics of the property. We generally offer a mix of adjustable-rate mortgage loans and fixed-rate mortgage loans with terms of to years. The residential real estate ACL model is adjusted for forecasted changes in the housing price indices at both the national and local level, the Case-Schiller Home Price Index, the national unemployment rate, Consumer Price Index CPI and Real Gross Domestic Product Real GDP ). Commercial real estate, single tenant net lease and multifamily The Company offers fixed and adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by small to moderately-sized office, retail and industrial properties located in our primary market area and are typically made to small business owners and professionals such as attorneys and accountants. We originate fixed-rate commercial real estate loans, generally with terms up to and payments based on an amortization schedule of to , resulting in balloon balances at maturity.

 (1 continued) Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses - continued and generally require specified debt service coverage ratios depending on the characteristics of the project. The Company offers single tenant net lease loans, which are derived from a commercial real estate lending program that is focused on loans to high net worth individuals and that are secured by low loan-to-value, single-tenant commercial properties that are generally leased to investment grade national-brand retailers, the borrowers and collateral properties for which are outside of our primary market area NNN Finance Program ). This program is designed to diversify the Company s geographic and credit risk profile given the geographic dispersion of the loans and collateral, and the investment grade credit of the national-brand lessees. The terms of the loans are generally consistent with the aforementioned terms of in-market commercial real estate loans; however, these cannot exceed loan-to-value and loan maturities cannot exceed the expiration of the underlying leases. The commercial real estate, single tenant net lease and multi-family ACL models are adjusted for forecasted changes in the Commercial Real Estate Price Index, which is a time series of commercial property values prepared by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the national unemployment rate, CPI and Real GDP. SBA commercial real estate and SBA commercial business The Company originates SBA commercial real estate loans and SBA commercial business loans under the SBA 7(a) program. Guaranteed portions are generally sold to the secondary market. The SBA commercial real estate ACL model is adjusted for forecasted changes in the Commercial Real Estate Price Index. Both the SBA commercial real estate ACL model and the SBA commercial business model are adjusted for the national unemployment rate, CPI and Real GDP. Residential and commercial construction The Company originates construction loans for one to four family homes and commercial properties such as small industrial buildings, warehouses, retail shops and office units. Construction loans, including speculative construction loans to builders who have not identified a buyer or lessee for the completed property at the time of origination, are made to a limited group of well-established builders in our primary market area and we limit the number of projects with each builder. Construction loans are typically for a term of 12 months with monthly interest only payments and interest rates on these loans are generally tied to the prime lending rate. The construction ACL model is adjusted for forecasted changes in the housing price indices, the Case-Schiller Home Price Index, the national unemployment rate, CPI and Real GDP. Land and land development On a limited basis, we originate loans to developers for the purpose of developing vacant land in our primary market area, typically for residential subdivisions. Land development loans are generally interest-only loans for a term of to . We generally require a maximum loan-to-value ratio of of the appraisal market value upon completion of the project. The land and land development ACL model is adjusted for forecasted changes in the housing price indices, the Case-Schiller Home Price Index, the national unemployment rate, CPI and Real GDP. Commercial business The Company typically offer commercial business loans to small businesses located in our primary market area. Commercial business loans are generally secured by equipment and general business assets. Key loan terms and covenants vary depending on the collateral, the borrower s financial condition, credit history and other relevant factors, and personal guarantees are typically required as part of the loan commitment.

 (1 continued) Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses continued and adjustable rate lines of credit with interest rates equal to a margin above the prime lending rate. We also offer auto and truck loans, personal loans and small boat loans. Consumer loans typically have shorter maturities and higher interest rates than traditional one-to four-family lending. We typically do not make home equity loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding , including any first mortgage loan balance. The ACL model for consumer loans is adjusted for forecasted changes in the housing price indices, the Case-Schiller Home Price Index, the national unemployment rate, CPI and Real GDP. Allowance for Credit Losses Unfunded Commitments The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated lives consistent with the Company s ACL methodology for loans. The allowance for unfunded commitments was million as of September 30, 2024, and is included in the liabilities section on the consolidated balance sheet. The current adjustment to the ACL for unfunded commitments is recognized through the provision for unfunded lending commitments, a component of provision for credit losses, in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Collateral Dependent Loans Loans on nonaccrual status which management believes the likely source of repayment to be operation or sale of the collateral are considered collateral dependent. Factors considered by management in determining collateral dependency include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Individually evaluated loans are measured on a loan-by-loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Values for collateral dependent loans are generally based on appraisals obtained from independent licensed real estate appraisers, with adjustments applied for estimated costs to sell the property, estimated costs to complete unfinished or repair damaged property, and other known defects. New appraisals are generally obtained for all significant properties when a loan is identified as collateral dependent. Generally, a property is considered significant if the value of the property is estimated to exceed . Subsequent appraisals are obtained as needed or if management believes there has been a significant change in the market value of a collateral property securing a collateral dependent loan. In instances where it is not deemed necessary to obtain a new appraisal, management would base its allowance for credit loss on the original appraisal with adjustments for current conditions based on management s assessment of market factors and management s inspection of the property.

The portion of the benefits associated with the income tax positions claimed on income tax returns that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits in the consolidated balance sheets, along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities, if there were an examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits are classified as additional income taxes in the consolidated statements of income. Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred income taxes. Income tax reporting and financial statement reporting rules differ in many respects. As a result, there will often be a difference between the carrying amount of an asset or liability as presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the amount that would be recognized as the tax basis of the same asset or liability computed based on the effects of tax positions recognized, as described in the preceding paragraph. These differences are referred to as temporary differences because they are expected to reverse in future years. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for temporary differences where their future reversal will result in future tax benefits. Deferred income tax assets are also recognized for the future tax benefits expected to be realized from net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences where their future reversal will result in the payment of future income taxes. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.

 privately-issued CMO was in a loss position and had depreciated approximately from its carrying value. This security was collateralized by residential mortgage loans, had a total fair value of and an unrealized loss of at September 30, 2024. Based on the independent third party analysis of the expected cash flows, securities had a credit loss totaling that was recorded through provision for credit losses on securities during the year ended September 30, 2024. An other-than temporary impairment charge of was recognized during the year ended September 30, 2023, which was prior to the Company s adoption of CECL. While the Company does not anticipate additional credit-related impairment losses at September 30, 2024, additional deterioration in market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the credit quality in the future and therefore, require additional credit-related impairment charges. The unrealized losses on U.S. Treasury bills and notes, agency mortgage-backed securities, agency CMOs, SBA certificates and municipal bonds relate principally to changes in current interest rates for similar types of securities. In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government, its agencies, or other governments, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition. Because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of its amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity, the Company has not recorded an allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024.

 Commercial real estate Single tenant net lease SBA commercial real estate Multifamily Residential construction Commercial construction Land and land development Commercial business SBA commercial business Consumer Total Financial Difficulty Modifications Effective October 1, 2023, the Company prospectively adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting for TDRs while establishing a new standard for the treatment of modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties (Financial Difficulty Modifications, or FDMs ). Prior period data, which included TDRs, has not been adjusted. An FDM may result when a borrower is in financial distress and may be in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, a term extension or an other than insignificant payment delay. In some cases, the Company may provide multiple types of modifications for a single loan. One type of modification, such as payment delay, may be granted initially. However, if the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another modification, such as term extension and/or interest rate reduction may be granted. Additionally, modifications with a term extension or interest rate reduction are intended to reduce the borrower s monthly payment, while modifications with a payment delay, which typically allow borrowers to make monthly payments or interest only payments for a period of time, are structured to cure the payment defaults by making delinquent payments due at maturity. There were new FDMs made or modifications of existing FDMs during the year ended September 30, 2024. The following table summarizes information regarding TDRs that were restructured during the year ended September 30, 2023: Total At September 30, 2023, the Company had commitments to lend to customers with outstanding loans classified as TDRs.

 recorded as a result of TDRs during the year ended September 30, 2023. There were principal charge-offs recorded as a result of TDRs during the year ended September 30, 2022. Provisions for loan losses related to TDRs totaled and for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the event that a TDR subsequently defaults, the Company evaluates the restructuring for possible impairment. As a result, the related allowance for loan losses may be increased or charge-offs may be taken to reduce the carrying amount of the loan. During the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any TDRs that were modified within the previous twelve months for which there was a payment default (defined as more than 90 days past due or in the process of foreclosure). SBA Loan Servicing Rights The Company originates loans to commercial customers under the SBA 7(a) and other programs, and sells the guaranteed portion of the SBA loans with servicing retained. Loan servicing rights on originated SBA loans that have been sold are initially recorded at fair value. Capitalized SBA servicing rights are then amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. Impairment of SBA servicing rights is assessed using the present value of estimated future cash flows. The aggregate fair value of SBA loan servicing rights approximates its carrying value. A valuation model employed by an independent third party calculates the present value of future cash flows and is used to estimate fair value at the date of sale and on a quarterly basis for impairment analysis purposes. Management periodically compares the valuation model inputs and results to published industry data in order to validate the model results and assumptions. Key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the SBA loan servicing rights include the discount rate and prepayment speed assumptions. For purposes of impairment, risk characteristics such as interest rate, loan type, term and investor type are used to stratify the SBA loan servicing rights. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. Changes in the valuation allowance are reported in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. Key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the SBA loan servicing rights at September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: to to Prepayment rate to to

MSRs retained for originated loans that have been sold are accounted for at fair value. The fair value of MSRs are determined using the present value of estimated expected net servicing income using assumptions about expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rate, servicing costs, and other economic factors, which are determined based on current market conditions. Changes in these underlying assumptions could cause the fair value of MSRs to change significantly in the future. Changes in fair value of MSRs are recorded in mortgage banking income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. MSRs are subject to changes in value from, among other things, changes in interest rates, prepayments of the underlying loans and changes in the credit quality of the underlying portfolio.

Dividends payable on allocated shares are charged to retained earnings and are satisfied by the allocation of cash dividends to participant accounts or by utilizing the dividends as additional debt service on the ESOP loan. Dividends payable on unallocated shares are not considered dividends for financial reporting purposes. Shares held by the ESOP trust are allocated to participant accounts based on the ratio of the current year principal and interest payments to the total of the current year and future years principal and interest to be paid on the employer loan. Compensation expense is recognized based on the average fair value of shares released for allocation to participant accounts during the year with a corresponding credit to stockholders equity. There was compensation expense recognized related to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The employer loan was fully repaid in December 2015 and all shares of Company stock were allocated to participant accounts as of September 30, 2016. The ESOP trust held and shares of Company common stock allocated to participant accounts at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The aggregate fair value of shares allocated to ESOP participants was million and million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company accounts for any forfeitures as they occur, and any previously recognized compensation cost for an award is reversed in the period the award is forfeited. Stock based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows: Restricted stock expense Stock Options: Under the plans, the Company may grant both non-statutory and incentive stock options that may not have a term exceeding . In the case of incentive stock options, the aggregate fair value (determined at the time the incentive stock options are granted) which are first exercisable during any calendar year shall not exceed . Exercise prices may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of the grant. The terms of the plans also include provisions whereby all unearned options and restricted shares become immediately exercisable and fully vested upon a change in control. Stock options granted generally vest ratably over one or and are exercisable in whole or in part for a period up to from the date of the grant. Compensation expense is measured based on the fair market value of the options at the grant date and is recognized ratably over the period during which the shares are earned (the vesting period). The fair market value of stock options granted is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes or a binomial option pricing model. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company s stock. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. The risk free rate for the expected life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date.

 million, which included federal tax credit carryforwards of million and state tax credit carryforwards of . All tax credit carryforwards were fully utilized in 2024. In assessing the ability of the Company to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, availability of operating loss carrybacks, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits of these deductible differences at September 30, 2024 and 2023, except for a valuation allowance of million and million, respectively, on the net deferred tax asset related to capital losses generated. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets for the capital loss carryforward, the Company considered all positive and negative evidence in assessing whether the weight of available evidence supports the recognition of some or all of the deferred tax assets related to these carryforwards. The Company may not be able to generate capital gains in the future to be able to utilize the capital losses. Therefore, the Company s assessment of the deferred tax asset warrants the need for a valuation allowance. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and does not anticipate any increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. The Company believes that its income tax positions would be sustained upon examination and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position or results of operations. The Company files consolidated U.S. federal and Indiana state income tax returns and the Bank files returns in additional states due to various nexus creating activities in these jurisdictions. Returns filed in these jurisdictions for tax years ending on or after September 30, 2021, are subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Each entity included in the consolidated federal and state income tax returns filed by the Company are charged or given credit for the applicable tax as though separate returns were filed. Retained earnings of the Bank at September 30, 2024 and 2023 include approximately million for which no deferred federal income tax liability has been recognized. This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions as of September 30, 1988 for tax purposes only. Reduction of such allocated amounts for purposes other than tax bad debt losses, including redemption of bank stock, excess dividends or loss of bank status, would create income for tax purposes only, subject to the then-current corporate income tax rate. The unrecorded deferred income tax liability on these amounts was approximately at September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 the leases in five year increments. Pursuant to FASB ASC 842, operating lease agreements are required to be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as a right of use ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability. All of the Company s leases are classified as operating leases. The Company has adopted all applicable practical expedients permitted under the standard, including the option to expense short-term leases with a term of one year or less. The Company s right to use an asset over the life of a lease is recorded as an ROU asset included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. The Company recorded a lease liability in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, which had a balance of million and million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of minimum lease payments. Regarding the discount rate, FASB ASC 842 requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. As this rate is rarely determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term. For operating leases existing prior to October 1, 2019, the rate for the remaining lease term as of October 1, 2019 was used. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases include one or more options to , with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to or more. The exercise of renewal options on operating leases is at the Company s sole discretion, and certain leases may include options to purchase the leased property. If at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. The Company does not enter into lease agreements which contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. At September 30, 2024, the Company had not entered into any leases that had yet to commence that conveyed the right to control the use of the property to the Company. Lease expense is included in occupancy and equipment expense on the consolidated statements of income, and was , and million for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

As noted in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , the Company estimates expected credit losses for unfunded lending commitments. Standby letters of credit are conditional lending commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company s policy for obtaining collateral, and the nature of such collateral, is essentially the same as that involved in making commitments to extend credit.

If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on internally-developed models or obtained from third parties that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters or a matrix pricing model that employs the Bond Market Association s standard calculations for cash flow and price/yield analysis and observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, or the lower of cost or fair value. These adjustments may include unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments have been applied consistently over time. The Company s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Company s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the valuation techniques and related inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis during the year ended September 30, 2024.

 interest rate lock commitments as of September 30, 2024. The table below presents information about significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used in the valuation of derivative financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2023. - Direct costs to close - Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights . The Company had residential mortgage servicing rights at September 30, 2024. Prior to the wind down of the Company's national mortgage banking operation in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company held residential mortgage servicing rights. The current market for residential MSRs is not sufficiently liquid to provide participants with quoted market prices. Therefore, the Company uses a discounted cash flow valuation model from an independent third party to determine the fair value of residential MSRs. The discounted cash flow model approach consists of projecting expected servicing cash flows and calculating the present value. The key assumptions used in the valuation of residential MSRs include mortgage prepayment speeds, discount rates and loan servicing costs. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, residential MSRs are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Collateral Dependent Loans . Collateral dependent loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional individual reserves and adjusted accordingly. In accordance with accounting standards, only collateral dependent loans for which an allowance for credit loss has been established or a partial charge-off recorded require classification in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of collateral dependent loans is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral may be real estate and/or business assets, including equipment, inventory and/or accounts receivable, and its fair value is generally determined based on real estate appraisals or other independent evaluations by qualified professionals. The appraisals are then discounted to reflect management s estimate of the fair value of the collateral given the current market conditions and the condition of the collateral. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of collateral dependent loans were as follows: - - Estimated costs to sell - - Provisions for credit losses recognized for collateral dependent loans for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

The fair value of nonresidential mortgage loan servicing rights is determined by management on a quarterly basis using a discounted cash flow model, and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have any nonresidential mortgage loan servicing rights measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The Company did t recognize any impairment charges on nonresidential mortgage loan servicing rights for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Other Real Estate Owned . Other real estate owned held for sale is reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. Fair value of other real estate owned is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Other real estate owned is reported at fair value, less estimated costs to dispose of the property. The fair values are determined by real estate appraisals which are then discounted to reflect management s estimate of the fair value of the property given current market conditions and the condition of the property. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have any other real estate owned measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

Under FASB ASC 825-10, the Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis, with changes in fair value reported in income. The election is made at the acquisition of an eligible financial asset or financial liability and may not be revoked once made. The Company had residential mortgage loans held for sale as of September 30, 2024. The Company has elected the fair value option for its residential mortgage loans held for sale as of September 30, 2023. These loans are intended for sale and the Company believes that the fair value is the best indicator of the resolution of these loans. Interest income is recorded based on the contractual terms of the loans and in accordance with the Company s policy on loans held for investment. None of these loans were 90 days or more past due, nor were any on nonaccrual status, as of September 30, 2023.

The fair value of loans (excluding loans held for sale), fixed-maturity certificates of deposit, and borrowed funds is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk of the instrument. It is not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLB and other restricted stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of investment securities, loans held for sale, loan servicing rights, and derivative assets and liabilities are discussed previously in Note 18.

 primary segments: core banking and SBA lending. Prior to September 30, 2023, the Company also operated a mortgage banking segment. However, the mortgage banking segment was wound down during the quarter ended December 30, 2023. The core banking segment originates residential, commercial and consumer loans and attracts deposits from its customer base. Net interest income from loans and investments funded by deposits and borrowings is the primary revenue for the core banking segment. The SBA lending segment originates loans guaranteed by the SBA, subsequently selling the guaranteed portion to outside investors. Net gains on sales of loans and net interest income are the primary sources of revenue for the SBA lending segment. The mortgage banking segment originated residential mortgage loans and sold them in the secondary market. Net gains on the sales of loans, income from derivative financial instruments and net interest income were the primary sources of revenue for the mortgage banking segment. The core banking segment is comprised primarily of the Bank and First Savings Investments, Inc., while the SBA lending segment s revenues are comprised primarily of net interest income and gains on the sales of SBA loans generated by Q2. The mortgage banking segment operated as a separate division of the Bank. The following segment financial information has been derived from the internal financial statements of the Company which are used by management to monitor and manage financial performance.

Exhibit 19.1 FIRST SAVINGS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. POLICY REGARDING INSIDER TRADING First Savings Financial Group, Inc. (the Company is a public company, the common stock of which is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a public company, the Company files periodic reports and proxy statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Investment in the Company s stock by directors, officers and employees is generally desirable and encouraged. However, such investments should be made with caution and with recognition of the legal prohibitions against the use of confidential information by insiders for their own profit. As a director, officer or employee of a public company, you have the responsibility not to participate in the market for the Company s stock while in possession of material, inside information about the Company. There are harsh civil and criminal penalties if you wrongly obtain or use such material, inside information in connection with buying or selling securities, or if you give that information to another person who uses it in connection with buying or selling securities. If you buy or sell securities while in possession of material, inside information, you will not only have to pay back any profit you made or loss you avoided, but you could be found guilty of criminal charges and face substantial fines or even prison. Additionally, the Company could be held liable for your violations of insider trading laws. To avoid these harsh consequences, the Company has developed the following guidelines to briefly explain the insider trading laws and set forth procedures and limitations on trading by directors, officers and employees. However, these guidelines do not address all possible situations that you may face. In addition, you need to review and understand the Company s Policy on Fair Disclosure to Investors that describes your obligations regarding the selective disclosure of confidential information to ensure compliance with SEC Regulation FD, which requires fair disclosure of material, non-public information. Insider Trading Concepts What is Inside Information? Inside information includes anything you become aware of because of your special relationship with the Company as a director, officer or employee and which has not been disclosed to the public (i.e., is non-public). The information may be about the Company, First Savings Bank (the Bank or other affiliates. It may also include information you learn about another company (for example, companies that are current or prospective customers or suppliers to the Company or the Bank or those with which the Company or the Bank may be in negotiations regarding a potential transaction). 

What is Material Information ? Information is material if a reasonable investor would think that it is important in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold stock, or if it could affect the market price of the stock. To fulfill the materiality requirement, there must be a substantial likelihood that a fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available. Generally, this means any information relating to the business and affairs of the Company that results in or would reasonably be expected to result in a significant change in the market price or value of any of the Company s securities. Either good or bad information may be material. If you are unsure whether the information is material, assume it is material. Examples of material information typically include, but are not limited to: Financial or accounting problems; Estimates of future earnings or losses; Events that could result in restating financial information; A proposed acquisition, sale or merger; Changes in key management personnel; Beginning or settling a major lawsuit; Changes in dividend policies; Declaring a stock split or dividend; A stock repurchase program; A stock or bond offering; or Any event requiring the filing or furnishing of a Form 8-K. What is Non-Public Information ? Non-public information is information that has not yet been widely disseminated to the public by the Company. Information only becomes public when the Company makes an official announcement (in a publicly accessible conference call, a press release issued through a national wire service or in SEC filings, for example) and people have had an adequate opportunity to see or hear and absorb it. Trading Guidelines A. Rules Applicable to All Directors, Officers and Employees No director, officer or employee may trade any security , whether issued by the Company or by any other company, while in possession of material inside information about the issuer. Further, no director, officer or employee may disclose material inside information to any other person (including immediate family members, friends or stockbrokers) so that such other person may trade in the stock. It is usually safe to buy or sell stock after the information is officially announced, as long as you do not know of other material information that has not yet been announced. Even after the information is announced, you should generally wait two full trading days before buying or selling securities to allow the market to absorb the information. 
 2 

 1. This means the following with respect to certain Bank or Company employee benefit plans: 401(k) Plan . An officer or employee having material inside information regarding the Company may not (i) initiate a transfer of funds into or out of the First Savings Financial Group, Inc. stock fund of the 401(k) plan, or (ii) increase or decrease an existing election to invest funds in the First Savings Financial Group, Inc. stock fund. However, ongoing purchases of the Company s stock through the plan pursuant to a prior election are not prohibited. Other Company Stock Purchase Plans . A director, officer or employee having material inside information regarding the Company may not sign up for, or increase participation in, any employee stock purchase plan or dividend reinvestment plan. However, ongoing purchases through those plans pursuant to a prior election are not prohibited. Stock Options . A director, officer or employee may exercise a Company employee or director stock option at any time, but any stock acquired upon such exercise may not be sold (whether by means of a cashless exercise or otherwise) if the director, officer or employee has material inside information regarding the Company. At any time, however, an employee may deliver Company stock already owned to pay the option exercise price and taxes. 2. This means with respect to hedging and other derivative transactions: Hedging and Other Derivative Transactions . Pursuant to the Company s Anti-Hedging Policy, no director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including the Bank), or any of his or her designees or related persons, may at any time purchase financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds), or otherwise engage in transactions, that hedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value of the Company s stock or other equity securities. B. Additional Rules Applicable to All Senior Officers, All Directors and All Persons in the Accounting Department (the Restricted Group 1. Blackout Periods Quarterly Blackout Periods . No person in the Restricted Group may trade in Company securities during a blackout period that begins on the fifteenth day of the last month of each calendar quarter (i.e., on September 15, December 15, March 15 and June 15) and ends two trading days after the public release of the Company s earnings for such quarter. The blackout period applies to (i) open market purchases or sales, (ii) a sale of securities following exercise of a stock option (including a sale by way of a cashless exercise), (iii) signing up for, or increasing participation in, any employee stock purchase plan or dividend reinvestment plan, (iv) initiating 
 3 

 a transfer of funds into or out of the First Savings Financial Group, Inc. stock fund of the 401(k) plan, or (v) increasing or decreasing an existing election to invest funds in the First Savings Financial Group, Inc. stock fund. However, ongoing purchases by any person through the 401(k) plan or other Company-sponsored plan pursuant to a prior election are permitted at any time (i.e., they are not subject to the blackout period). The Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, in consultation with the Company s counsel, may permit transactions during the blackout period upon request where the person making the request is not in possession of material inside information. Temporary Blackout Periods . The Company may also institute temporary blackout periods in the event of a material corporate development. Notice of temporary blackout periods will be distributed by means of a written or electronic communication specifying the duration of the blackout period and the persons subject to it. Written Plan Exception . The limitations of the quarterly and temporary blackout periods shall not apply to trading in Company securities pursuant to a written plan for trading securities provided that such plan meets the requirements of SEC Rule 10b5-1 and is approved in advance by the Company s Board of Directors. See also Sections C.4 and C.5 below. 2. Selling Short . No person in the Restricted Group may at any time sell short Company stock or otherwise sell any equity securities of the Company that they do not own. Generally, a short sale means any transaction whereby one may benefit from a decline in the Company s stock price. 3. Options . No person in the Restricted Group may at any time buy or sell options on Company securities (so called puts and calls except in accordance with a program approved by the Company s Board of Directors or a trade cleared by the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer. This restriction does not apply to the exercise of employee or director stock options, which is treated under Section A above. 4. Margin Accounts and Pledges . Securities held in a margin account may be sold by the broker without the customer s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities held in an account which may be borrowed against or are otherwise pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. A margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of material non-public information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Company securities and, as a result, the pledgor may be subject to liability under insider trading laws. Therefore, you may not purchase Company securities on margin, or borrow against any account in which Company securities are held, or pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan. 
 4 

 An exception to this prohibition may be granted where a person wishes to pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan from a third party (not including margin debt) and clearly demonstrates the financial capacity to repay the loan without resort to the sale of the pledged securities. Any person who wishes to pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan from a third party must submit a request for approval to the Company s Board of Directors at least two weeks before signing the documents evidencing the proposed pledge. C. Additional Rules for Section 16 Reporting Persons 1. Pre-Clearance and Reporting . Any trade of the Company s securities by a director or executive officer, or a family member sharing the same household or a corporation or trust they control, must be pre-cleared with the Filing Coordinator identified in the Company s Section 16 Compliance Program and must be reported promptly to the Filing Coordinator once made. If, upon requesting clearance, you are advised that Company stock may not be traded, you may not engage in any trade of any type under any circumstances, nor may you inform anyone of the restriction. You may re-apply for pre-clearance at a later date when trading restrictions may no longer be applicable. It is critical that you obtain pre-clearance of any trading to prevent both inadvertent short-swing profit or insider trading violations and to avoid even the appearance of an improper transaction (which could result, for example, when an officer engages in a trade while unaware of a pending major corporate development). 2. Options and Other Stock Plans . The exercise of Company stock options and/or the sale of stock acquired upon an exercise, the transfer of funds into and out of the First Savings Financial Group, Inc. stock fund in the 401(k) plan, and other transactions in the Company s stock plans are subject to special rules. The Filing Coordinator must be contacted before any such transaction is conducted. 3. Pension Fund Blackouts . All purchases, sales or transfers of the Company s securities by directors and executive officers during a pension fund blackout period are prohibited. A pension fund blackout period exists whenever 50 or more of the plan participants are unable to conduct transactions in their accounts for more than three consecutive days. These blackout periods typically occur when there is a change in the retirement plan s trustee, record keeper or investment manager. Directors and executive officers will be contacted when these or other restricted trading periods are instituted. 4. Pre-Clearance for Rule 10b5-1 Plans . Directors and executive officers may not implement a trading plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1 at any time without prior clearance. Directors and executive officers may only enter into a trading plan when they are not in possession of material inside information. In addition, directors and executive officers may not enter into a trading plan during a quarterly blackout period, a temporary blackout period or a pension fund blackout period. Once a 
 5 

 trading plan is pre-cleared, trades made pursuant to the plan will not require additional pre-clearance, but only if the plan specifies the dates, prices and amounts of the contemplated trades or establishes a formula for determining dates, prices and amounts. Transactions made under a trading plan must be promptly reported to the Filing Coordinator who will prepare the necessary Form 4. 5. Cooling-Off Period for Rule 10b5-1 Plans . Transactions under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan may only begin after a cooling-off period: For directors and executive officers, the cooling-off period is the later of (i) 90 days after the adoption of the trading plan or (ii) two business days following the disclosure of the Company s financial results for the fiscal quarter in which the trading plan was adopted, whether disclosed in a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as applicable. For persons who are not directors or executive officers, the cooling-off period is 30 days after adoption of the trading plan. D. Additional Rules Applicable to Proposed Mergers/Acquisitions Whenever the Company is actively considering a particular company for acquisition or for another significant business relationship (such as a joint venture) or whenever another company is considering acquiring the Company, all of the Company s employees involved in, or aware of, due diligence or other planning for or attention to the acquisition or business relationship are prohibited from trading in any of the Company s securities and any securities of the other company. Note : This policy applies to personal securities transactions by the directors, officers and employees identified above, and also applies to: 1. Transactions for accounts in which a director, officer or employee has an interest in or an ability to influence transactions; and 2. Transactions by a director s, officer s or employee s spouse or any other member of his or her household unless (i) the household member s investment decisions are made independently of the director, officer or employee, and (ii) the household member has not received inside information about the issuer of the security. It must be understood, however, that the director, officer and employee and/or the household member will bear the burden of demonstrating that the household member has not received inside information. Furthermore, directors and executive officers are subject to special rules in this regard and any proposed transaction in Company securities by a corporation, trust or other entity they control or by a family member sharing the same household must be discussed 
 6 

 in advance with the President and Chief Executive Officer or Company counsel. E. Stock Repurchases by the Company Although this policy does not restrict the Company from purchasing its common stock, the Board of Directors has delegated to the President and Chief Executive Officer or his designee(s) the authority and discretion to authorize the Company to purchase Company common stock pursuant to a Board-approved and currently effective stock repurchase program, including during a restricted trading period under this policy, provided that the President and Chief Executive Officer or his designee(s) determines that the following conditions are met: 1. The Company is not in possession of non-public material information that prohibits such purchases; 2. Market conditions for the repurchase are favorable; 3. There are no material differences in the financial condition of the Company from that referenced in the last publicly reported balance sheet date; 4. There are no material differences in the consolidated results of core operations of the Company for the current quarter and the average for the four most recent quarterly periods; 5. It is anticipated that expected earnings for the current quarter will not be materially different from analysts publicly-announced estimates for the current quarter or guidance provided by the Company, if any; 6. The Company is not currently in the process of conducting a transaction or series of related transactions that have not been publicly disclosed and which, if consummated, would likely have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company, nor is the Company actively considering any such transaction or series of transactions; 7. The stock repurchases are conducted in accordance with the currently effective stock repurchase program and are not being conducted for the purpose of manipulating the trading market for the Company common stock; and 8. The President and Chief Executive Officer or his designee(s) has sought the advice of any advisors as he or they shall deem appropriate. 
 7 

 Confidentiality Serious problems could develop for the Company by unauthorized disclosure of inside information about the Company, whether or not for the purpose of facilitating improper trading of the Company s stock. Confidentiality of Non-Public Information Directors, officers and employees of the Company should not discuss internal matters or developments with anyone outside of the Company (including family members, securities analysts, individual investors, members of the investment community and news media), except as required in the performance of regular corporate duties. In addition, directors, officers and employees of the Company with knowledge of material, non-public information should only disclose such information to other Company personnel on a need-to-know basis so that the group of individuals with knowledge of material, non-public information is kept as small as possible. All inquiries about the Company made by the financial press, by investment analysts or others in the financial community, or by shareholders must be handled in accordance with the Company s Policy on Fair Disclosure to Investors. If you have any doubt as to your responsibilities under this policy, you should seek clarification from the Disclosure Policy Compliance Officer before acting. Prohibition Against Internet Disclosure It is inappropriate for any unauthorized person to disclose Company information or to discuss the Company s prospects on the Internet, including in any forum or chat room where companies and their prospects are discussed. The posts in these forums are, in some cases, made by investors who are poorly informed, who have malicious intent, or who intend to benefit their own stock positions. To avoid the disclosure of material, inside information, no director, officer or employee may discuss the Company or Company-related information in an Internet forum or chat room, regardless of the situation. If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact the Company s Compliance Officer.
