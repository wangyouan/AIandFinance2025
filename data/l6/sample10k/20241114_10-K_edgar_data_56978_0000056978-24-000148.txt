 Key Events in Fiscal 2024 
 Cancellation of Project W 
 The Company was engaged by one of its customers (the "Customer") to support the Customer with the development and future mass production of certain technologies relating to advanced display (the "Project"), which project was previously referred to as Project W. In connection with the Customer's strategic review of its business, the Customer informed the Company that it cancelled the Project. In connection with the foregoing, on March 11, 2024, the Company committed to a plan to cease operational activities and commence wind down activities concerning various aspects of the Project. As of September 28, 2024, the wind down activities have been substantially completed. The cancellation of the Project resulted in the reduction of the Company's fiscal 2024 revenue by approximately 15 million. The Company also incurred certain charges during the year ended September 28, 2024 and expects to incur an immaterial amount of additional related charges in fiscal year 2025.

 Macroeconomic Headwinds 
 The cost of logistics remains high as a result of macroeconomic conditions, inflation and labor shortages across layers of the supply chain. The Company s management continues to monitor the economy for signs of any expansion of economic or supply chain disruptions or broader supply chain inflationary and logistical costs resulting either directly or indirectly from the tensions in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia. 
 The ongoing tensions in the Middle East and the prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict did not have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in fiscal 2024. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, existing facility agreements, and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements, notwithstanding the ongoing tensions in the Middle East and the prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict and other macroeconomic factors, for at least the next twelve months from the date of this Annual Report. However, this is a highly dynamic situation. As the macroeconomic situation remains highly volatile and the geopolitical situation remains uncertain, there is uncertainty surrounding the operations of our manufacturing locations, our business, our expectations regarding future demand and supply conditions, our near- and long-term liquidity and our financial condition. Consequentially, our operating results could deteriorate. 
 During fiscal years 2021 and 2022, semiconductor suppliers rapidly increased production output in response to increases in end-consumer demand. Concerns surrounding supply availability have spurred defensive inventory purchases, which led to a heightened demand for our products. 
 The current macroeconomic conditions and declining consumer sentiment during fiscal years 2023 and 2024 have persisted, which continues to exacerbate inventory buildup in the semiconductor industry. Many of our customers who accumulated our products in the past three years continue to reduce their order rates as a result of inventory adjustment. 
 Due to general inflationary pressures, declining consumer sentiment, and an economic downturn caused, directly or indirectly, by various macroeconomic factors, including the ongoing tensions in the Middle East and the prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict, the sector continues to experience volatility and disruption. However, we believe that the long-term semiconductor industry macroeconomics have not changed and we anticipate that the industry s growth projections will normalize. 
 For other information, please see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors . 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On August 15, 2017, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a program (the Program to repurchase up to 100 million of the Company s common stock on or before August 1, 2020. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization under the Program to 200 million, 300 million and 400 million, respectively. On March 3, 2022, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization under the Program by an additional 400 million to 800 million, and extended its duration through August 1, 2025. On November 17, 2023, the Company modified its written trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, dated as of May 7, 2022, to facilitate repurchases under the Program. The modification provided for the purchase of up to approximately 169 million of the Company s common stock from November 20, 2023 through August 1, 2025. The Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and is funded using the Company s available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased through open market and/or privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the Program depend on market conditions as well as corporate and regulatory considerations. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, the Company repurchased a total of approximately 3,221.0 thousand shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately 151.0 million. The stock repurchases were recorded in the periods they were delivered and accounted for as treasury stock in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company records treasury stock purchases under the cost method using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Upon re-issuance of treasury stock, amounts in excess of the acquisition cost are credited to additional paid-in capital. If the Company reissues treasury stock at an amount below its acquisition cost and additional paid-in capital associated with prior treasury stock transactions is insufficient to cover the difference between acquisition cost and the reissue price, this difference is recorded against retained earnings. 
 As of September 28, 2024, our remaining stock repurchase authorization under the Program was approximately 30.3 million.

Dividends 
 On August 26, 2024, May 16, 2024, March 14, 2024 and November 15, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.20 per share of common stock, resulting in an aggregate dividend of 0.80 per share of common stock for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that such dividends are in the best interests of the Company s shareholders. 
 Business Environment 
 The semiconductor business environment is highly volatile and is driven by internal dynamics, both cyclical and seasonal, in addition to macroeconomic forces. Over the long term, semiconductor consumption has historically grown, and is forecasted to continue to grow. This growth is driven, in part, by regular advances in device performance and by price declines that result from improvements in manufacturing technology. In order to exploit these trends, semiconductor manufacturers, both IDMs and OSATs, periodically invest aggressively in the latest generation capital equipment. This buying pattern often leads to periods of excess supply and reduced capital spending the so-called semiconductor cycle. Within this broad semiconductor cycle there are also, generally weaker, seasonal effects that are specifically tied to annual, end-consumer purchasing patterns. Typically, semiconductor manufacturers prepare for heightened demand by adding or replacing equipment capacity by the end of the September quarter. Occasionally, this results in subsequent reductions in the December quarter. This annual seasonality can be overshadowed by effects of the broader semiconductor cycle. Macroeconomic factors also affect the industry, primarily through their effect on business and consumer demand for electronic devices, as well as other products that have significant electronic content such as automobiles, white goods, and telecommunication equipment. There can be no assurances regarding levels of demand for our products and we believe historic industry-wide volatility will persist. 
 From time to time, our customers may request that we deliver our products to countries where they own or operate production facilities or to countries where they utilize third-party subcontractors or warehouses as part of their supply chain. For example, customers headquartered in the U.S. may require us to deliver our products to their back-end production facilities in China. Our customer base in the Asia/Pacific region has become more geographically concentrated over time as a result of general economic and industry conditions and trends. Approximately 90.6 and 91.2 of our net revenue for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, was for shipments to customer locations outside of the U.S., primarily in the Asia/Pacific region. Approximately 53.3 and 38.6 of our net revenue for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, was for shipments to customers headquartered in China. 
 While our customers have generally been impacted by the current global macroeconomic conditions, those with operations in China, an important manufacturing and supply chain hub, have witnessed a faster decline in demand and, accordingly, a faster decline in product shipments, compared to the rest of the world. The shipments to customers headquartered in China are subject to heightened risks and uncertainties related to the respective trade and export control policies of the governments of China and the U.S. Furthermore, there remains a potential risk of conflict and instability in the relationship between Taiwan and China that could disrupt the operations of our customers and/or suppliers in both Taiwan and China and our manufacturing operations in Taiwan and China. 
 The U.S. and several other countries have levied tariffs on certain goods and have introduced other trade restrictions resulting in substantial uncertainties in the semiconductor, LED, memory and automotive markets. 
 Our Ball Bonding Equipment, Wedge Bonding Equipment and Advanced Solutions reportable segments, as well as the remaining operating segments in the All Others category, are primarily affected by the industry s internal cyclical and seasonal dynamics in addition to broader macroeconomic factors that can positively or negatively affect our financial performance. The sales mix of IDM and OSAT customers in any period also impacts financial performance, as changes in this mix can affect our products average selling prices and gross margins due to differences in volume purchases and machine configurations required by each customer type. 
 Our Aftermarket Products and Services APS segment has historically been less volatile than the other reportable segments. APS sales are more directly tied to semiconductor unit consumption rather than capacity requirements and production capability improvements.

We continue to position our business to leverage our research and development leadership and innovation and to focus our efforts on mitigating volatility, improving profitability and ensuring longer-term growth. We remain focused on operational excellence, expanding our product offerings through continuous research and development or acquisitions and managing our business efficiently throughout the business cycles. Our visibility into future demand is generally limited, forecasting is difficult, and we generally experience typical industry seasonality. 
 To limit potential adverse cyclical, seasonal and macroeconomic effects on our financial position, we have continued our efforts to maintain a strong balance sheet. As of September 28, 2024, our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were 577.1 million, a 182.3 million decrease from the prior fiscal year end. We believe our ability to maintain a strong cash position will allow us to continue to invest in product development, pursue non-organic growth opportunities and return capital to investors through our share repurchase and dividend programs. Please see Part II, Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information. 
 Technology Leadership 
 We compete in the General Semiconductor, LED, Automotive Industrial and Memory end markets by offering our customers advanced capital equipment, tools and solutions primarily addressing their semiconductor interconnect and device assembly needs. Our technology leadership directly contributes to the strong market positions of our ball bonder, wedge bonder, advanced solutions, and other leading tools, services and solutions. To maintain our competitive advantage, we invest in product development activities designed to enhance existing products and to deliver next-generation solutions. These investments often focus on progressing the broader assembly process in addition to advancing specific hardware and software features within our broadening capital equipment and aftermarket solutions portfolios. In support of this development effort, we typically work in close collaboration with customers, end users, and other industry members. In addition to producing technical advances, these collaborative development efforts strengthen customer relationships and enhance our reputation as a technology leader and solutions provider. 
 In addition to gold, silver alloy wire and aluminum wire, our leadership in the industry s use of copper wire for the bonding process is an example of the benefits of our collaborative efforts. By working with customers, material suppliers, and other equipment suppliers, we have developed a series of robust, high-yielding production processes, which have made the use of copper wire for the bonding process widely accepted and significantly reduced the cost of assembling an integrated circuit. 
 Our leadership also has allowed us to maintain a competitive position in the latest generations of ball bonders. Building on the success of RAPID, which is the first product in the smart bonder series to address the Industry 4.0 requirements, our RAPID Pro introduces additional functionality including the latest response-based processes. The RAPID series continues to excel in providing real-time process and performance monitoring, real-time equipment health monitoring, advanced data analytics and traceability, predictive maintenance monitoring and analysis, and detection and enhanced post-bond inspection. 
 We optimize our bonder platforms to deliver variants of our products to serve emerging high-growth markets. For example, we have developed extensions to address opportunities in memory assembly with our RAPID MEM, in particular for NAND Flash storage. 
 Our leading technology for wedge bonder equipment uses ribbon or heavy wire for different applications such as power electronics, automotive and semiconductor applications. The advanced interconnect capabilities of PowerFusion PS improve the processing of high-density power packages, due to an expanded bondable area, wider leadframe capability, indexing accuracy and teach mode. In all cases, we are making a concerted effort to develop commonality of subsystems and design practices, in order to improve performance and design efficiencies. We believe this will benefit us as it will increase synergies between our various product engineering groups. Furthermore, we continually research adjacent market segments where our technologies could be used. Our Asterion hybrid wedge bonder has demonstrated the capability to provide and enable an expanded bond area, laser bonding, new robust pattern recognition capabilities and extremely tight process controls. Another example of our developing equipment for high-growth niche markets is our AT Premier PLUS . This machine utilizes a modified wire bonding process to mechanically place bumps on devices in a wafer format, for variants of the flip chip assembly process. Typical applications include complementary metal-oxide semiconductor CMOS image sensors, surface acoustical wave SAW filters and high brightness LEDs. These applications are commonly used in most, if not all,

Table of Contents 

 of the smartphones available today in the market. We also have expanded the use of AT Premier PLUS for wafer level wire bonding for micro-electro-mechanical systems MEMS and other sensors. 
 Our technology leadership and bonding process know-how have enabled us to develop highly function-specific equipment with high throughput and accuracy. This forms the foundation for our advanced packaging equipment development. With the launch of our APAMA TM , APAMA Plus TM and APTURA TM , we are also developing and manufacturing advanced packaging solutions for the emerging 2.5-dimensional integrated circuit 2.5D IC and 3-dimensional integrated circuit 3D IC markets. By reducing the interconnect dimensions, 2.5D ICs and 3D ICs are expected to provide form factor, performance and power efficiency enhancements over traditional flip-chip packages in production today. High-performance processing and memory applications, in addition to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, are earlier adopters of this new packaging technology. Chiplets are emerging as an alternative methodology for developing advanced system-level designs. Chiplets of various functions and typically fabricated in different process nodes are mixed-and-matched and assembled in a package with the goal of speeding up time-to-market and reducing cost. This methodology of developing advanced system-level designs is increasing the complexity of packages. Our leadership in system-in-package SiP ), multi-chip module MCM and heterogeneous integration are well positioned to address the requirements of this emerging and growing trend. 
 The APTURA TM is a highly capable thermo-compression bonding system which supports ultra-fine-pitch fluxless direct-copper thermo-compression as well as the CuFirst TM hybrid bonding process. Both fluxless thermo-compression ("FTC") as well as CuFirst TM are well positioned to enable growth of chiplet-based advanced packages. 
 We continue to expand technology partnerships with key customers and through engagements with institutions and consortiums, including the UCLA Center for Heterogeneous Integration and Performance Scaling CHIPS ), Penn State Center for Heterogeneous Integration of Micro Electronic Systems CHIMES ), and the US-Joint semiconductor consortium led by Resonac Holdings Corporation. 
 In addition to our growing heterogeneous opportunities, we have also broadened our mass reflow advanced packaging solutions to include high-accuracy flip chip and fan-out wafer level packaging FOWLP with Katalyst TM . Our electronics assembly solutions are also capable of advanced package-on-package, wafer level packaging WLP ), embedded die, and active and passive die placement for SiP, enabling us to diversify our business while further expanding market reach into the automotive, LED lighting, medical and industrial segments. 
 With the launch of LUMINEX TM , our high-speed die placement as well as mass die transfer are now available to support various applications in the integrated circuit and advanced display value chain. In LUMINEX TM , we believe we remain well positioned to provide mini-LED and direct-emissive displays for high volume adoption. We remain focused on driving innovation and delivering new solutions that directly address the next set of semiconductor assembly challenges assembling the next-generation of electronic devices. 
 We bring the same technology focus to our tools business, driving tool design and manufacturing technology to optimize the performance and process capability of the equipment in which our tools are used. For all our equipment products, tools are an integral part of their process capability. We believe our unique ability to simultaneously develop both equipment and tools is a core strength supporting our products' technological differentiation.

 Sales and Customer Support 
 We believe long-term customer relationships are critical to our success, and comprehensive sales support and customer support are an important means of establishing those relationships. To maintain these relationships, we primarily utilize our direct sales force, as well as distribution channels such as agents and distributors, depending on the product, region, and end-user application. In all cases, our goal is to position our sales support and customer support resources near our customers facilities so as to provide support for customers in their own language and consistent with local customs. Our sales support and customer support resources are located primarily in Singapore, Israel, Taiwan, China, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, India, the U.S., Germany, Mexico, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Supporting these local resources, we have technology centers offering additional process expertise in Singapore, China, Switzerland, Israel, the U.S. and the Netherlands. 
 By establishing relationships with semiconductor manufacturers, OSATs, and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems, we gain insight into our customers' future semiconductor packaging strategies. In addition, we also send our products and equipment to customers and potential customers for trial and evaluation. These insights assist us in our efforts to develop products and processes that address our customers' future assembly requirements. 
 Backlog 
 Our backlog consists of customer orders scheduled for shipment within the next twelve months. A majority of our orders are subject to cancellation or deferral by our customers with limited or no penalties. Also, customer demand for our products can vary dramatically without prior notice. Because of the volatility of customer demand, possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations and potential delays in product shipments, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of net revenue for any succeeding period. 
 The following table reflects our backlog as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023: 
 As of (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Backlog 148,585 423,824 
 Manufacturing 
 We believe excellence in manufacturing can create a competitive advantage, both by producing at lower costs and by providing superior responsiveness to changes in customer demand. To achieve these goals, we manage our manufacturing operations through a single organization and believe that fewer, larger factories allow us to capture economies of scale and generate cost savings through lower manufacturing costs. 
 Our equipment manufacturing activities consist mainly of integrating outsourced parts and subassemblies and testing finished products to customer specifications. We largely utilize an outsource model, allowing us to minimize our fixed costs and capital expenditures. For certain low-volume, high customization parts, we manufacture subassemblies ourselves. Just-in-time inventory management has reduced our manufacturing cycle times and lowered our on-hand inventory requirements. Raw materials used in our equipment manufacturing are generally available from multiple sources; however, many outsourced parts and components are only available from a single or limited number of sources. 
 Our ball bonder, wedge bonder, AT Premier, APAMA TM , APAMA Plus TM , APTURA TM and Katalyst TM bonder manufacturing and assembly is done at our facility in Singapore. Our Hybrid and Electronic Assembly solutions manufacturing and assembly is done at our facility in the Netherlands. Our advanced dispensing manufacturing and assembly is done at our facility in Taiwan. We have ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certifications for our equipment manufacturing facilities in Singapore and in the Netherlands. 
 We manufacture dicing blades, capillaries and a portion of our bonding wedge inventory at our facility in China. The capillaries are produced at our facilities in China and Israel. We both produce and outsource the production of our bonding wedges. Our China and Israel facilities are ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certified.

 Research and Product Development 
 Many of our customers generate technology roadmaps describing their projected packaging technology requirements. Our research and product development activities are focused on delivering robust production solutions to those projected requirements. We accomplish this by regularly introducing improved versions of existing products or by developing next-generation products. We follow this product development methodology in all our major product lines. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Where circumstances warrant, we apply for patents on inventions governing new products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, and manufacturing activities. We currently hold a number of U.S. patents, many of which have foreign counterparts. We believe the duration of our patents often exceeds the commercial life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents. Additionally, we believe much of our important technology resides in our trade secrets and proprietary software. 
 Competition 
 The market for semiconductor equipment and packaging materials products is intensely competitive. Significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment market include price, speed/throughput, production yield, process control, delivery time, innovation, quality and customer support, each of which contribute to lower the overall cost per package being manufactured. Our major equipment competitors are ASM Pacific Technology, Hesse GmbH, Han's Laser Technology Co., Ltd., BE Semiconductor Industries N.V., Hanwha Precision Machinery Co., Ltd., Panasonic Holdings Corporation, Yamaha Robotics Holdings Co. Ltd., and Nordson Corporation. 
 Significant competitive factors in the semiconductor packaging materials industry include performance, price, delivery, product life, and quality. Our significant consumables competitors are PECO Co., Ltd., Disco Corporation, Small Precision Tools Co., Ltd. and Chaozhou Three-Circle (Group) Co., Ltd. 
 In each of the markets we serve, we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants, some of which may have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing resources. 
 Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use, emission, discharge, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees. In addition, we are subject to environmental laws which may require investigation and cleanup of any contamination at facilities we own or operate or at third-party waste disposal sites we use or have used. 
 We have incurred in the past, and expect in the future to incur, costs to comply with environmental laws. We are not, however, currently aware of any material costs or liabilities relating to environmental matters, including any claims or actions under environmental laws or obligations to perform any cleanups at any of our facilities or any third-party waste disposal sites, that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. However, it is possible that material environmental costs or liabilities may arise in the future. 
 Though the majority of our manufacturing activities take place outside of the U.S., certain of our advanced packaging products are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations EAR because they are based on U.S. technology or contain more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content. The EAR require licenses for, and sometimes prohibit, the export of certain products. The Commerce Control List CCL sets forth the types of goods and services controlled by the EAR, including civilian science, technology, and engineering dual-use items. For products listed on the CCL, a license may be required as a condition to export depending on the end destination, end use or end user and any applicable license exceptions. 
 Our business is subject to various other regulations typical of businesses of our type in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We maintain an export compliance program designed to meet the requirements of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State.

 Business Continuity Management Plan 
 We have developed and implemented a global Business Continuity Management Plan BCP for our business operations. The BCP is designed to facilitate the prompt resumption of our business operations and functions arising from an event which impacts or potentially impacts our business operations. As the scale, timing, and impact of disasters and disruptions are unpredictable, the BCP has been designed to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. The BCP provides a structured framework for safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting our books and records, perpetuating critical business functions, and enabling the continuation of customer transactions. We review and update our BCP on a periodic basis to reflect any changes in our Company s structure, operations or environment that may affect its continuity. 
 Environmental, Social and Governance ESG 
 We continue to proactively manage and address the ESG topics that are of concern to us and our stakeholders. The sustainability governance structure at K S continues to evolve and mature. In fiscal 2022, we embedded our four corporate social responsibility pillars into a wider ESG framework now covering the full spectrum of ESG-related efforts and initiatives, and further integrated these ESG-related considerations, efforts and initiatives into many of our business and operational practices. 
 We also established an ESG council to oversee our ESG efforts. The ESG council comprises sub-components overseen by organizational leads, with each lead providing regular updates on status and planned initiatives to defined ESG council work streams. The ESG council provides quarterly updates to our executive leadership, with the Nominating and Governance Committee NGC of the Board of Directors receiving summary reports on a semi-annual basis. 
 In fiscal 2023, we performed an independent, limited external assurance of our direct (Scope 1) and purchased energy indirect (Scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions data under the operational control boundary of eight of our global operational sites. 
 For more information on our ESG efforts, please refer to our Sustainability Report 2023, which can be found on our website at https://www.kns.com/ESG.

 Safe Workplace 
 We endeavor to provide a safe and healthy workplace for all our employees. The health and safety of our employees is of paramount importance to the Company, and forms an integral part of our organizational culture. The Executive Safety Committee (the Safety Committee ), that was established in fiscal 2022, provides overall leadership and policy in discharging the Company s safety responsibilities while promoting a culture of safety within the Company. The Safety Committee, together with key site and operations leadership responsible for the Company s workplace safety and health, works together to establish and communicate a vision for the Company s workplace safety. Each of our key manufacturing and R D sites have also established its Environment, Health and Safety EHS practices, objectives and performance targets, which are overseen by an EHS Committee, led by an EHS Manager or a Safety Representative from each key operations function. To ensure that all employees are familiar with our safety standards and actions, we conduct regular health and safety-related trainings including an online-based Corporate Safety Training module, as well as hands-on emergency preparedness training comprising periodic fire drill evacuations, first-aid, fire-fighting and hazardous chemical spillage response drills. This training is included in our new hire on-boarding programs with employee-wide refresher trainings conducted every two years. 
 As and when required, including as a response to a potential global health crisis, our Company will implement site specific business continuity and risk mitigation plans to help maintain the health and safety of our employees. 
 Human Resource HR Practices 
 At K S, we aim to recruit, develop and retain a high performing and diverse workforce while fostering a safe and productive work environment for employees to maximize individual and organizational potential. Our regional HR managers support the local leaders and managers, ensuring that our employment and labor practices adhere to regional and local regulations. We continually review these policies and benchmark them against market peers to help ensure that we implement leading practices on recruitment, onboarding and employee development. Our HR function also includes centers of excellence in Talent Management, Talent Acquisition, HR Shared Services, and Global Compensation and Benefits, ensuring best practices in these important areas. 
 Employee Development 
 We believe in investing in our employees professional growth by encouraging them to continually develop their functional and leadership skills and to gain different experiences across the Company as they progress along their career paths and grow within our organization. Our Learning and Development Framework which is based on identified professional and management competencies and the Company s core values, is tailored to specific target groups such as new hires, professional and support staff levels, manager levels as well as identified key talents from our succession planning process. These development programs are also based on the 70/20/10 learning and development model under which individuals obtain 70 of their knowledge through experiential learning, 20 through social learning and 10 from formal educational events. We encourage our employees to not only participate actively in technical and soft skill training programs, but also to learn through peer coaching and mentoring, and to develop professionally through various stretch assignments and projects. In fiscal 2024, we continued with our global leadership development programs aimed at accelerating the development of our high potential mid-career professionals and managers to prepare them to assume broader leadership roles. 
 Following employee feedback in the last employee engagement survey, we introduced a formalized career progression framework and associated tools to provide clarity and guidance to both managers and employees. The framework provides clarity and tools for employees in the Professional and Management Career tracks on the requisite competencies for advancement to the next career level within the Company. Employees are encouraged to enroll in the various training courses intended to support their development in the required competency stages as they chart their career progression with the Company. 
 Compensation Benefits 
 We strive to ensure fair, equitable and competitive pay for all employees within the locations where they work, and we obtain market knowledge about pay levels by participating in multiple globally recognized compensation surveys annually. The survey organizations pool our data together with all the responding companies to determine market relevant pay ranges for all our positions. Our analysis and programs also evaluate industry sector information most relevant to us. The Company also strives to ensure that our employee benefits are compliant in the cities, states and countries in which we operate, while annual benefits benchmarking ensures that our benefits are attractive in the markets where we compete for talent.

 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Semiconductor Industry and Macroeconomic Risks 
 Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted by volatile worldwide economic conditions and unpredictable spending by our customers due to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. 
 Though the semiconductor industry s cycle can be independent of the general economy, global economic conditions may have a direct impact on demand for semiconductor units and ultimately demand for semiconductor capital equipment and tools. Accordingly, our business and financial performance is impacted, both positively and negatively, by fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. Expenditures by our customers depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors, LEDs and batteries, including mobile devices, personal computers, consumer electronics, telecommunications equipment, automotive components, electric vehicles and other industrial products. Reductions or other fluctuations in our customers' spending as a result of uncertain conditions and volatility in the macroeconomic environment, including from government, economic or fiscal instability, economic recession, actual or potential inflation, rising interest rates, slower growth in certain geographic regions, global trade issues, global health crises and pandemics, restricted global credit conditions, reduced demand, excess inventory, higher energy prices, or other conditions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Further, our profitability can be affected by volatility because we incur a certain amount of fixed costs that we cannot modulate up and down to meet increases or decreases in demand. The impact of broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment could make our customers cautious and delay orders until the economic outlook becomes clearer. Significant downturns in the market for semiconductor devices or in general economic conditions reduce demand for our products and can materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our visibility into future demand is generally limited and forecasting is difficult, and we believe historic, industry-wide volatility will persist. 
 International political instability, geopolitical tensions, terrorist acts and acts of war may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The threat of terrorism or acts of war, risks and rumors of war, escalation and civil disturbances, including the prolonged tensions in the Middle East and the Ukraine/ Russia conflict, increases the uncertainty in our markets and could adversely affect our business. On October 7, 2023, an escalated armed conflict between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization commenced, leading to a series of extended hostilities along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip. Additionally, since October 8, 2023, the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group has increased its hostilities against Israel over its northern region, including Haifa. The situation in Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon remains highly tense and volatile. 
 Many multinational companies in the semiconductor industry have research, design and development centers situated in Israel, including our Company, which has a manufacturing facility and a business office in Haifa. 
 The intensity, duration and outcome of the ongoing war is uncertain and its continuation or escalation may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. While we are currently maintaining business and operations in Israel without material damage or interruptions at our Israeli facility, our assets and operations in Israel could be vulnerable to future property damage, inventory loss, business disruption, and expropriation. 
 We have approximately 70 employees in Israel. The ongoing war could cause harm to our employees and otherwise impair their ability to work for extended periods of time, as well as disrupt supply chains, transport networks, telecommunications and financial systems, and other critical infrastructure necessary to conduct business in Israel. In late September 2024, missiles fired by the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group were seen being intercepted by Israeli air defense system over the city of Haifa. As the intensity of the war has been rapidly evolving, including the potential for heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, we continue to receive and review reports concerning our operations and business partners and remain vigilant. 
 The risk of cybersecurity incidents may also increase in connection with the ongoing war. These attacks may impact critical infrastructure and financial institutions globally, which in turn could adversely affect our operations. While we have taken actions to mitigate such potential risks, the proliferation of malware from the war into systems unrelated to the war, or cyberattacks targeted against U.S. companies, could adversely affect our operations. 
 Even if the war moderates, or a peaceful resolution in the region is reached, the detrimental impact to the global financial markets may be far-reaching, and may not recover immediately. The potential effects of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 We depend on our suppliers, including sole source suppliers, for raw materials, components and subassemblies. If our suppliers do not deliver their products to us, or deliver non-compliant or defective products, we would be unable to deliver our products to our customers. 
 Our products are complex and require raw materials, components and subassemblies having a high degree of reliability, accuracy and performance. We rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of these components and subassemblies and we rely on sole source suppliers for certain key technology parts and raw materials. As a result, we are exposed to a number of significant risks, including: 
 decreased control over the manufacturing process for components and subassemblies; 
 changes in our manufacturing processes in response to changes in the market, which may delay our shipments; 
 our inadvertent use of defective or contaminated raw materials; 
 the relatively small operations and limited manufacturing resources of some of our suppliers, which may limit their ability to manufacture and sell subassemblies, components or parts in the volumes we require and at acceptable quality levels and prices; 
 restrictions on our ability to rely on suppliers due to changes in trade regulation as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns related to climate change, conflict minerals, or responsible sourcing practices; 
 the inability of suppliers to meet our or other customer demand requirements; 
 reliability or quality issues with certain key subassemblies provided by single source suppliers as to which we may not have any short-term alternative; 
 shortages caused by disruptions at our suppliers and subcontractors for a variety of reasons, including public health emergencies and associated containment measures, war or geopolitical tensions (such as the prolonged tensions in the Middle East and the Ukraine/Russia conflict), significant natural disasters (including as a result of climate change) or significant price changes (including as a result of inflationary pressures); 
 delays in the delivery of raw materials or subassemblies, which, in turn, may delay shipments to our customers; 
 loss of suppliers as a result of consolidation of suppliers in the industry; and 
 loss of suppliers because of their bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 If any of these risks were to materialize, we might be unable to deliver our products to our customers on time and at expected cost, or at all. While we observed some easing of the industry-wide supply constraints in fiscal 2024, we expect some constraints to continue from time to time and the duration of such constraints or their long-term impact on our business cannot be predicted at this time. 
 As part of our supply chain management, we may from time to time increase our inventory levels to mitigate against anticipated future component shortages. These increases in our inventory levels may lead to an excess of materials in the future in the event that the demand for our products is lower than our expectations or if we otherwise fail to anticipate future customer demand properly. Excess inventory levels could result in inventory write-downs at discounted prices, which could adversely affect our cash flows or gross margins. As a result, our business, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. 
 The semiconductor industry is volatile with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns. Cyclical industry downturns are made worse by volatile global economic conditions. 
 The semiconductor industry is volatile, with periods of rapid growth followed by industry-wide retrenchment. These periodic downturns and slowdowns have in the past adversely affected our business, financial condition and operating results. Downturns have been characterized by, among other things, diminished product demand, excess production capacity, and accelerated erosion of selling prices. Historically these downturns have severely and negatively affected the industry s demand for capital equipment, including assembly equipment and, to a lesser extent, tools. In any case, we believe the historical volatility of our business, both upward and downward, will persist. Consequently, our revenues may decline, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

 Difficulties in forecasting demand for our product lines may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excesses. 
 We typically operate our business with limited visibility of future demand. We do not have long-term contracts with many of our customers. As a result, demand for our products in future periods is difficult to predict and we sometimes experience inventory shortages or excesses. We generally order supplies and otherwise plan our production based on internal forecasts for demand. We have in the past failed, and may again in the future fail, to accurately forecast demand for our products. This has led to, and may in the future lead to, delays in product shipments or, alternatively, an increased risk of inventory obsolescence. As part of our supply chain management, we have increased our inventory levels in an effort to mitigate component shortages, which may increase the risk of inventory obsolescence. If we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and may continue to do so in the future. 
 In the past, our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly. We expect that our quarterly results will continue to fluctuate. Although these fluctuations are partly due to the cyclical and volatile nature of the semiconductor industry, they also reflect other factors, many of which are outside of our control. 
 Some of the factors that may cause our net revenue and operating margins to fluctuate significantly from period to period are: 
 market downturns; 
 industry inventory levels; 
 the mix of products we sell because, for example: 
 certain lines of equipment or certain aftermarket tools within our business segments are more profitable than others; and 
 some sales arrangements have higher gross margins than others; 
 canceled or deferred orders; 
 variations in sales channel or mix of direct sales and indirect sales; 
 seasonality; 
 competitive pricing pressures may force us to reduce prices; 
 higher than anticipated costs of development, achieving customer acceptance or production of new products; 
 the availability and cost of the components for our products; 
 delays in the development and manufacture of our new products and upgraded versions of our products and market acceptance of these products when introduced; 
 customers delay in purchasing our products due to anticipation that we or our competitors may introduce new or upgraded products; and 
 our competitors introduction of new products. 
 Many of our expenses, such as research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses, and interest expense, do not vary directly with our net revenue. Our research and development efforts include long-term projects lasting a year or more, which require significant investments. In order to realize the benefits of these projects, we believe that we must continue to fund them even during periods when our revenue has declined. As a result, a decline in our net revenue would adversely affect our operating results as we continue to make these expenditures. In addition, if we were to incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we did not experience comparable increased net revenue, our operating results would decline. In a downturn, we may have excess inventory, which could be written off. Some of the other factors that may cause our expenses to fluctuate from period-to-period include: 
 timing and extent of our research and development efforts; 
 severance, restructuring, and other costs of relocating our manufacturing or warehouse facilities; 
 inventory write-offs due to obsolescence, project cancellations or other causes; and 
 an increase in the cost of labor or materials. 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 Because our net revenue and operating results are volatile and difficult to predict, we believe consecutive period-to-period or year-over-year comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. 
 Competitive Risks 
 Our average selling prices usually decline over time and may continue to do so. 
 Typically, our average selling prices have declined over time due to continuous price pressure from our customers, our competitors and general cost reductions within our industry s supply chains. The Chinese government s initiatives around self-sustainability are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity. With considerable incentives from the Chinese government, manufacturers based in China are able to lower selling prices, thereby increasing overall competition. This has resulted in a lowering of our average selling prices in China. We seek to offset this decline by continually reducing our cost structure by consolidating operations in lower cost areas, reducing other operating costs, by pursuing product strategies focused on product performance and customer service, and developing new products for which we are able to charge higher prices. These efforts may not enable us to fully offset price declines, and if they do not, our financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. 
 We may not be able to rapidly develop, manufacture and gain market acceptance of new and enhanced products required to maintain or expand our business. 
 We believe our continued success depends on our ability to continuously develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner in response to customers demands for higher performance assembly equipment and leading-edge materials customized to address rapid technological advances in integrated circuits, and capital equipment designs. Our competitors may develop new products or enhancements to their products that offer improved performance and features, or lower prices which may render our products less competitive. The development and commercialization of new products require significant capital expenditures over an extended period of time, and some products we seek to develop may never become profitable. In addition, we may not be able to develop and introduce products incorporating new technologies in a timely manner that will satisfy our customers future needs or achieve market acceptance. If we are not able to develop and sell our products that meet the demands of our customers, it would result in lower net revenues and our operating results would be adversely affected. 
 We may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor equipment and packaging materials industries. 
 The semiconductor equipment and packaging materials industries are very competitive. In the semiconductor equipment industry, significant competitive factors include price, speed/throughput, production yield, process control, footprint, delivery time, innovation, quality and customer support. In the semiconductor packaging materials industry, significant competitive factors include price, delivery and quality. 
 In each of our markets, we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants. In addition, established competitors may combine to form larger, better-capitalized companies. Some of our competitors have or may have significantly greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Some of these competitors are Asian and European companies that have had, and may continue to have, an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers who appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers. Some of these competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area, all of which could result in lowering the barriers to entry. Some governments may have provided, and will continue to provide, financial assistance or other support to some of our competitors or to new entrants, to advance the nation's growth in the semiconductor equipment and packaging materials industries.

 We expect our competitors to improve their current products performance, and to introduce new products and materials with improved price and performance characteristics. Our competitors may independently develop technology similar to or better than ours. They may also appropriate our technology and our intellectual property to compete against us and we may not have adequate legal recourse. New product and material introductions by existing competitors or by new market entrants could hurt our sales. If a semiconductor manufacturer or subcontract assembler selects a competitor s product or materials for a particular assembly operation, we may not be able to sell products or materials to that manufacturer or assembler for a significant period of time. Manufacturers and assemblers sometimes develop lasting relationships with suppliers and assembly equipment providers in our industry and often go years without requiring replacement. In addition, we may have to lower our prices in response to price cuts by our competitors, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If we cannot compete successfully, we could lose customers and experience reduced margins and profitability. 
 
 Geographic, Trade and Customer Risks 
 Substantially all of our sales, distribution channels and manufacturing operations are located outside of the U.S., which subjects us to risks, including risks from changes in trade regulations, currency fluctuations, political instability and conflicts. 
 From time to time, our customers may request that we deliver our products to countries where they own or operate production facilities or to countries where they utilize third-party subcontractors or warehouses as part of their supply chain. Our customer base in the Asia/Pacific region has become more geographically concentrated over time as a result of general economic and industry conditions and trends. Over 90 of our net revenue is derived from shipments to customers located outside of the U.S., primarily in the Asia/Pacific region. Approximately 53.3 and 38.6 of our net revenue for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, was derived from shipments to customers headquartered in China. 
 We expect our future performance to depend on our ability to continue to compete in foreign markets, particularly in the Asia/Pacific region. Some of these economies have been highly volatile, resulting in significant fluctuation in local currencies, and political and economic instability. Some of these economies may also increase trade protectionism, thereby increasing barriers to entry, amplifying supply chain risks and adversely affecting the demand for our products. These conditions may continue or worsen, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 We also rely on non-U.S. suppliers for materials and components used in our products, and substantially all of our manufacturing operations are located in countries other than the U.S. We currently manufacture our ball, wedge, APAMA TM and APTURA TM bonders in Singapore, our Hybrid and Electronic Assembly solutions in the Netherlands, our dicing blades, capillaries and bonding wedges in China, our capillaries in Israel and China, and our advanced dispensing equipment in Taiwan. We also rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain of our product lines. As a result, a major portion of our business is subject to the risks associated with international commerce, particularly Asia/Pacific region, such as: 
 stringent and frequently changing trade compliance regulations; 
 less protective foreign intellectual property laws, and the enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights; 
 longer payment cycles in foreign markets and potential default risks; 
 foreign exchange restrictions and capital controls, monetary policies and regulatory requirements; 
 restrictions or significant taxes on the repatriation of our assets, including cash; 
 tariff and currency fluctuations; 
 difficulties of staffing and managing dispersed international operations, including labor work stoppages and strikes in our factories or the factories of our suppliers; 
 changes in our structure or tax incentive arrangements; 
 possible disagreements with tax authorities; 
 episodic events outside our control such as, for example, outbreaks of coronaviruses, influenza, monkeypox or other illnesses;

 war, risks and rumors of war and civil disturbances, including the prolonged tensions in the Middle East and the Ukraine/Russia conflict, or other events that may limit or disrupt manufacturing, markets and international trade; 
 act of terrorism that impact our operations, customers or supply chain or that target U.S. interests or U.S. companies; 
 seizure of our foreign assets, including cash; 
 the imposition of sanctions of countries in which we do business; 
 changing political conditions and rising geopolitical tensions; and 
 legal systems which are less developed and may be less predictable than those in the U.S. 
 In addition, there remains a potential risk of conflict and instability in the relationship between Taiwan and China which could disrupt the operations of our customers and/or suppliers in both Taiwan and China, our manufacturing operations in Taiwan and China, and our future plans in the region. 
 Our international operations also depend on favorable trade relations between the U.S. and those foreign countries in which our customers, subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations. A protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. 
 Catastrophic events, such as pandemics and extreme weather events as a result of climate change, can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. 
 Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by natural disasters, public health issues, interruptions of service from utilities, or other catastrophic events including as a result of climate change. In addition, global climate change can result in natural disasters occurring more frequently, with greater intensity and with less predictability. We also operate in seismic zones including Taiwan, which is located within a complex zone of convergence between the Philippines Sea Plate and Eurasian Plate. For example, in April 2024, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck Taiwan, resulting in significant injuries and death, leading to a temporary suspension of business and services. Although our advanced dispensing manufacturing operations in Taiwan were not affected, the earthquake resulted in the temporary suspension of other semiconductor factories and suppliers who operate in Taiwan. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the semiconductor industry in particular are unclear but could be severe, and could exacerbate the other risk factors described herein. Catastrophic events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, whether on a timely basis or at all, which could adversely affect our revenue and operations. Some of the systems we maintain as part of our business recovery plans cannot guarantee us protection from such disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or if we managed to recover our operations quickly, if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, we may be unable to fulfil our customers orders, and may experience reduced or cancelled orders or other disruptions to our supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We are subject to export restrictions that may limit our ability to sell to certain customers, and trade wars, in particular the U.S.-China trade war, could adversely affect our business. 
 The U.S. and several other countries levy tariffs on certain goods and impose other trade restrictions that may impact our customers investment in manufacturing equipment, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies. In particular, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating since 2018, with U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods, and there remains significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and China. We cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in response. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, additional taxes, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or 
 18

 inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 Though nearly all of our manufacturing activities take place outside of the U.S., certain of our advanced packaging products are subject to the EAR because they are based on U.S. technology or contain more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content. The EAR require licenses for, and sometimes prohibit, the export of certain products. The CCL sets forth the types of goods and services controlled by the EAR, including civilian science, technology, and engineering dual-use items. For products listed on the CCL, a license may be required as a condition to export depending on the end destination, end use or end user and any applicable license exceptions. 
 In 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security BIS amended the EAR to expand controls on certain foreign products based on U.S. technology and sold to Huawei and certain other companies. In October 2022, the BIS amended the EAR again to extend those foreign controls to numerous companies on BIS so-called Entity List. The 2020 and 2022 amendments impact some of our advanced packaging products, which are based on U.S. technology and are within the scope of the expanded EAR controls on Huawei and other Entity List companies. Therefore, these products cannot be sold to Huawei and other Entity List companies, and are subject to certain end-use restrictions. To date, these amendments to the EAR have not had a material direct impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations and we do not expect that they will, although they could have indirect impact, including increasing tensions in U.S. and Chinese trade relations, potentially leading to negative sentiments towards U.S.-based companies among Chinese consumers. Additionally, some end users may prefer to avoid the U.S. supply chain in its entirety to avoid the application of these regulations. 
 In November 2023, the BIS issued additional rules to update export controls on advanced computing semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, as well as items that support supercomputing applications and end-uses, to arms embargoed countries, including China. 
 We are taking appropriate measures to comply with all applicable BIS Rules. Where required, we will apply for export licenses from the BIS to avoid disruption to our customers operations. Export licenses may be subject to a prolonged review and appeals process, to which there cannot be an assurance as to whether an export license may be granted, granted with conditions or eventually revoked due to subsequent challenge. 
 Additionally, the rules promulgated by the BIS are typically complex, and the BIS could revise or expand them in response to public comments. Likewise, the BIS may issue guidance clarifying the scope of the rules. Such revisions, expansions or guidance could change the impact of the rules for our business. 
 Future changes in, and responses to, the various export regulations, tariffs, or other trade regulations between the U.S. and other countries may be unpredictable. Such further changes may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to decline, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Because a small number of customers account for most of our sales, our net revenue could decline if we lose a significant customer. 
 The semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated, with a relatively small number of large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems purchasing a substantial portion of our semiconductor assembly equipment and packaging materials. Sales to a relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for a significant percentage of our net revenue. There was no customer with sales representing more than 10 of net revenue in fiscal 2024. Sales to our ten largest customers comprised 53.6 and 53.5 of our net revenue for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. 
 We expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net revenue for the foreseeable future. Thus, our business success depends on our ability to maintain strong relationships with our customers and closely understand their present and anticipated utilization rates. Any one of a number of factors could adversely affect these relationships. If, for example, during periods of escalating demand for our equipment, we were unable to add inventory or increase our production capacity quickly enough to meet the needs of our customers, or if we are not able to fulfil our customers' orders due to supply chain constraints, they may turn to other suppliers making it more difficult for us to retain their business. We may also make commitments from time-to-time to our customers regarding minimum volumes and performance standards, and if we are unable to meet those commitments, we may incur liabilities to our customers. If we lose orders from a significant customer that we are not 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 able to replace, or if a significant customer reduces its orders substantially, or if we incur liabilities for not meeting customer commitments, these losses, reductions or liabilities may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 We maintain a backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation, reduction or delay in delivery schedules, which may result in lower than expected revenues. 
 We manufacture products primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts. As a result, we must commit resources to the manufacture of products without binding purchase commitments from customers. The semiconductor industry is occasionally subject to double-booking and rapid changes in customer outlooks or unexpected build ups of inventory in the supply channel as a result of shifts in end market demand and macro-economic conditions. Accordingly, many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty. Even in cases where our standard terms and conditions of sale or other contractual arrangements do not permit a customer to cancel an order without penalty, we may from time to time accept cancellations to maintain customer relationships or because of industry practice, custom or other factors. The broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment may result in lower than expected demand for our products, and our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on our levels of inventory, revenues and profitability. 
 The cancellation and wind down of the Project may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In connection with the cancellation of a project with one of its customers (previously referred to as Project W) (the "Project"), on March 11, 2024, the Company committed to a plan to cease operational activities and commence wind down activities concerning various aspects of the Project. As of September 28, 2024, the wind down activities have been substantially completed and as a result of these activities, the Company incurred certain charges during fiscal year 2024. The Company's estimates of the anticipated impact on its results of operations and the timing thereof are subject to a number of assumptions and actual amounts may differ materially from estimates. As we further wind down the Project, we may discover other facts that could require us to incur additional expenses and/or record additional charges that may be different from our initial expectations about the costs of the wind down. In addition, we may not be able to complete the wind down in all respects due to factors outside of our control. If actual amounts were to differ from our estimates, or if the full and complete wind down takes longer than expected, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Cancellations of significant orders or other similar projects by other customers in the future could also cause the Company to incur additional costs or expenses or lead to a reduction in future revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 As a result of the cancellation of the Project, the Company has refocused its development resources towards other growth-centric opportunities supporting technology changes within the thermocompression, Vertical Fan-Out, Automotive and Dispense markets. The Company may experience operational difficulties as it shifts its development resources to these other opportunities, which may result in disruptions to the Company's operations. We cannot be certain that these efforts will be effective or successful, or that we will realize the anticipated benefits of the refocus. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Human Capital Risks 
 Our business depends on attracting and retaining management, sales and technical employees as well as on the succession of senior management. 
 Our future success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified management, sales, finance, accounting and technical employees, including senior management. Experienced personnel with the relevant and necessary skill sets in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Asia, where most of the Company s key personnel are located. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain the managerial, marketing, finance, accounting and technical personnel we require, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. 
 Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution. From time to time, senior management or other key employees may leave our Company, and the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, the effectiveness of our 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and the results of our operations. Changes in immigration policies may also impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. In addition, hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement critical personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future revenues. 
 Product Risks 
 Alternative packaging technologies may render some of our products obsolete and materially and adversely affect our overall business and financial results. 
 Alternative packaging technologies have emerged that may improve device performance, reduce the size of or enhance the number of components inherent in an integrated circuit package, as compared to traditional wire bonding. These technologies include hybrid bonding, thermo-compression bonding, flip chip bonding and wafer-level packaging. Some of these alternative technologies eliminate the need for wires to establish the electrical connection between a die and its package. The semiconductor industry may, in the future, shift a significant part of its volume into alternative packaging technologies which do not employ our products. If a significant shift to alternative packaging technologies or to another technology not offered by us were to occur, demand for our equipment and related packaging materials may be materially and adversely affected. Given that a majority of our revenue comes from wire bonding, a reduced demand for our wire bonding equipment could materially and adversely affect our financial results. 
 We may send products and equipment to customers or potential customers for trial, evaluation or other purposes which may result in retrofit charges, impairments or write-down of inventory value if the products and equipment are not subsequently purchased by the customers. 
 From time to time we send certain products and equipment to customers or potential customers for testing, evaluation or other purposes in advance of receiving any confirmation of purchase or purchase orders. Such equipment may be at the customer location for an extended period of time per the agreements with these customers and potential customers. The customer or potential customer may refuse to buy all or partial quantities of such product or equipment and return this back to us. As a result, we may incur charges to retrofit the machines or sell the machines as second hand at a lower price, and accordingly may have to record impairments on the returned inventory, all of which would adversely affect our operating results. 
 Undetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results. 
 If errata (deviations from product specifications) or flaws in design, production, assembly or testing of our products (by us or our suppliers) were to occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in materially adverse consequences, including: 
 incurring warranty expenses; 
 writing off the value of inventory; 
 disposing of products that cannot be fixed; 
 retrofitting products that have been shipped; 
 providing product replacements or modifications; and 
 defending against litigation. 
 Continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities, control of material, emphasis on product safety and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing are critical factors in our future growth. Our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate tests and manufacturing processes for our products may not be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment, significant repair or replacement costs, potential damage to our reputation or general customer dissatisfaction with our products. We may also not be able to successfully claim against our suppliers or obtain product liability or other insurance to fully cover such risks. Any of the foregoing risks, if they were to materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

 Operations and Supply Chain Risks 
 We may not be able to continue to consolidate or relocate manufacturing and other facilities or entities without incurring unanticipated costs and disruptions to our business. 
 As part of our ongoing efforts to drive further efficiency, we may consolidate or relocate our manufacturing and other facilities or entities. Should we consolidate or relocate, we may experience unanticipated events, including the actions of governments, suppliers, employees, union representatives or customers, which may result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our business. We may also incur restructuring charges, severance costs, asset impairments, loss of accumulated knowledge, inefficiency during transitional periods, employee attrition and other effects that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be materially and adversely affected by environmental and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations implemented in response to climate change. 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use, emission, discharge, transportation and disposal of hazardous material, investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and the health and safety of our employees. Public attention continues to focus on the environmental impact of manufacturing operations and the risk to neighbors of waste and chemical releases from such operations. 
 Proper waste disposal plays an important role in the operation of our manufacturing plants. Most of our facilities operate under permits that must be renewed periodically. A violation of those permits may lead to revocation of the permits, fines, penalties or the incurrence of capital or other costs to comply with the permits, including the potential shutdown of operations. 
 Compliance with existing or future land use, environmental, climate-related and health and safety laws and regulations may: (1) result in significant costs to us for additional capital equipment or other process requirements; (2) restrict our ability to expand our operations; and/or (3) cause us to curtail our operations. We also could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines or other sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations. 
 Increasingly, various agencies and governmental bodies have expressed interest in promulgating rules relating to climate change. For example, in March 2022, the SEC published a proposed rule that would require companies to provide significantly expanded climate-related disclosures in their Form 10-K, which may require us to incur significant additional costs to comply and impose increased oversight obligations on our management and Board of Directors. The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to conduct our business. 
 In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations (including any relating to climate change and greenhouse gas GHG emissions) could require us, or others in our value chain, to install additional equipment, alter operations to incorporate new technologies or processes and generally enhance audit, surveillance and compliance measures. 
 To the extent that higher costs incurred from the above activities result in higher prices for our products, we may experience a reduction in the demand for those products, which could negatively affect our results of operations. Conversely, we may not be able to pass these increased costs onto our customers in the form of higher prices, as a result of which our results of operations may also be adversely affected. 
 We may acquire or divest businesses or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances, which may materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 We continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses and may decide to buy or sell businesses or enter into joint ventures or other strategic alliances. We may not find suitable acquisition candidates, we may not be able to close such acquisitions, and the acquisitions we complete may not be successful. We may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses with our existing businesses and successfully implement, improve and expand our systems, procedures and controls to accommodate these acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully integrate any acquired businesses with ours, the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or may take longer than expected to be realized. We may also incur higher than expected costs as a result of any acquisitions or experience an overall post-completion process that takes longer than originally anticipated. 
 These transactions place additional demands on our management, our various functional teams and our current labor force. The combination of businesses may result in the loss of key personnel or an interruption of, or loss of 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 momentum in, our existing businesses and/or the acquired business. In addition, we may need to divest existing businesses, which would cause a decline in revenue or profitability and may make our financial results more volatile. If we fail to integrate and manage acquired businesses successfully or to mitigate the risks associated with divestitures, joint ventures or other alliances, or if the time and costs associated with integration exceeds our expectations, or if our acquired business were to perform poorly, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. 
 Increasing attention to ESG matters, including any targets or other ESG initiatives, could result in additional costs or risks or adversely impact our business 
 Certain investors, shareholder advocacy groups, other market participants, customers and other stakeholder groups have focused increasingly on companies' environmental, social and governance ESG initiatives, including those concerning climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, human rights, diversity and inclusion, and shareholder proxy access. This may result in increased costs, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations and related costs, or other adverse impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 From time to time, we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters. Our sustainability report continues to outline our Company s strategies, initiatives and performance of ESG topics identified through a materiality assessment to be most relevant to the operations and stakeholders of our Company. In fiscal 2023, we performed an independent, limited external assurance of our direct (Scope 1) and purchased energy indirect (Scope 2) greenhouse gas emission data under the operational control boundary of eight of our global operational sites, and published such limited external assurance in our sustainability report. However, the identification, assessment, and disclosure of such matters remains complex. Many of the statements in such voluntary disclosures are based on our expectations and assumptions, which may require substantial discretion and forecasts about costs and future circumstances. 
 Additionally, ESG matters continue to evolve rapidly. Organizations that provide information to investors on ESG matters may develop more discrete rating matrices, benchmarks and processes on evaluating companies on their ESG approach. This may create opportunities for misalignment or perceived failure resulting in unfavorable ESG ratings. This could foster negative investor sentiment toward us, our customers, or our industry, which could negatively impact our business and operations. To the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, it may also impede our ability to compete as effectively to recruit or retain employees, which may adversely affect our operations. 
 Intellectual Property Risks 
 Our success depends in part on our intellectual property, which we may be unable to protect. 
 Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. To protect this technology, we rely principally on contractual restrictions (such as nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions) in our agreements with employees, subcontractors, vendors, consultants and customers and on the common law of trade secrets and proprietary know-how . We also rely, in some cases, on patent and copyright protection, although this protection may in some cases be insufficient due to the rapid development of technology in our industry. We may not be successful in protecting our technology for a number of reasons, including the following: 
 employees, subcontractors, vendors, consultants and customers may violate their contractual agreements or post-employment non-competition obligations, and the cost of enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive, or those agreements may be unenforceable or more limited than we anticipate; 
 foreign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights; 
 our patent and copyright claims may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our technology; our patents or copyrights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented; or we may otherwise be unable to obtain adequate protection for our technology; and 
 when our patents expire, or if they are invalidated, narrowed or circumvented, our competitors may be able to utilize the inventions protected by our patents. 
 Also, competitors may copy or misappropriate our trade secrets, products or designs either through lawful means of reverse engineering or through independent development. We remain vigilant and take note of similar products and solutions offered by our competitors and, based on reasonable efforts, investigate whether any of our competitors products or solutions is the outcome of unlawful reverse engineering. For example, we are currently investigating a 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 potential unlawful reverse engineering incident and, where necessary, plan to pursue appropriate legal action against parties that may be involved in such unlawful reverse engineering. 
 Competitors or third parties (including ex-employees violating their surviving contractual obligations with us) may also copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or solutions through unlawful means, or illegally use information that we regard as proprietary. While we conduct active surveillance and monitor potential threats surrounding any unauthorized use from competitors or third parties, we may not be able to detect misuse of our proprietary information before it occurs. For example, as a result of our active surveillance, we have learned that certain ex-employees in China, who had access to materials containing proprietary information and trade secrets about our products and designs, may have provided them to their current employer that is our direct competitor. We continue to fully investigate this matter and, if appropriate, pursue litigation against all parties that may be involved to protect our confidential information and trade secrets. 
 Despite our best efforts in active surveillance and monitoring, such policing may be difficult, time-consuming, non-definitive and non-exhaustive, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. 
 Additionally, laws of foreign countries may not provide us with adequate remedy against unauthorized use of our intellectual property, or we may be unable to prove unauthorized use as prescribed by such foreign laws. In either case, if the protection of our intellectual property proves to be inadequate or unenforceable, others may be able to use our proprietary developments without compensation or appropriate remediation to us, resulting in potential cost advantages to our competitors and consequentially eroding our market share. 
 Furthermore, our partners and alliances may have rights to technology developed by us. We may incur significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may be weakened. 
 Third parties may claim we are infringing on their intellectual property, which could cause us to incur significant litigation costs or other expenses, or prevent us from selling some of our products. 
 The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, with frequent introductions of new products and technologies. Industry participants often develop products and features similar to those introduced by others, creating a risk that their products and processes may give rise to claims they infringe on the intellectual property of others. We may unknowingly infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and incur significant liability for that infringement. If we are found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, we could be enjoined from continuing to manufacture, market or use the affected product, or be required to obtain a license to continue manufacturing or using the affected product. A license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing or re-engineering our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly, impractical or time consuming. 
 Occasionally, third parties assert that we are, or may be, infringing on or misappropriating their intellectual property rights. Some of these assertions may not be legitimate. In these cases, we defend or in some instances dispel, and will continue to defend or dispel, against claims or negotiate licenses where we consider these actions appropriate. Intellectual property cases are uncertain, time-consuming and involve complex legal and factual questions. If we become involved in this type of litigation, it could consume significant resources and divert our attention from our business. 
 Information Technology and Enterprise System Risks 
 We may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business. We also hold large amounts of data in data center facilities around the world, primarily in Singapore and the U.S., on which our business depends. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems owned or used by us or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business. Our security procedures, such as virus protection software, data loss protection and our business continuity planning, such as our disaster recovery policies and back-up systems, may not be adequate or implemented properly to fully address the adverse effect of such events, which could adversely impact our operations. 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, our business could be adversely affected to the extent we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems as our technology systems become out-of-date or obsolete and are not able to deliver the type of data integrity and reporting we need to run our business. Furthermore, when we implement new systems and/or upgrade existing systems, we could be faced with temporary or prolonged disruptions that could adversely affect our business. For example, artificial intelligence AI may be used to generate cyberattacks with greater scale and efficacy than the traditional threat actors. In other instance, a cybersecurity threat could be introduced as the result of our business partners incorporating the output of an AI tool that includes a threat, such as introducing malicious code by incorporating an AI generated source code. 
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. For example, in May 2024, the Company detected unauthorized access attempts into its network and servers and determined that the threat actor accessed and acquired some of its data, including source code, engineering information, business partner data and personally identifiable information. The Company believes that this cybersecurity incident has not had a material impact on the Company's operations, and the Company currently does not expect that this incident is reasonably likely to materially impact the Company's overall financial condition, results of operations or business outlook. Notwithstanding the foregoing, future attempts or breaches might, especially given that threat actors may leverage other means and technologies, including artificial intelligence, to circumvent controls and avoid detection. We devote significant resources to network security and other measures to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, our cybersecurity risk management, process, protocols and tools, may not be fully implemented or may not completely protect the Company against future cybersecurity incidents. Depending on its nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (of the Company or that belonging to its third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. 
 We also try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information by using commonly accepted information technology systems and network security measures. Such measures may not provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. For example, our internal procedures may not prevent an existing or former employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to fully protect our interests. 
 While we maintain insurance policies that may cover certain liabilities in connection with a cybersecurity incident, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. 
 We are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system. Our failure to implement it successfully, on time and on budget could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 In 2020 we began implementing a new enterprise resource planning ERP system, and will continue to implement the new system in phases across our various entities over the next two years. ERP implementations are complex, time-consuming, labor intensive, and involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities. The ERP system is critical to our ability to provide important information to our management, obtain and deliver products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately maintain books and records, provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results, and otherwise operate our business. ERP implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system. Any such implementation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. The implementation and maintenance of the new ERP system has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant financial and human resources and the implementation may be subject to delays and cost overruns. In addition, we may not be able to successfully complete the implementation of the new ERP system without experiencing difficulties. 
 Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation or the ongoing maintenance of the new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately maintain books and records, provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results, including reports required by the 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 SEC such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and otherwise operate our business. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed. 
 Currency and Tax Risks 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows. 
 Because most of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollar, an increase in value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies will make our products more expensive than those offered by some of our foreign competitors. In addition, a weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies could make our costs in certain non-U.S. locations more expensive to fund. Our ability to compete overseas may therefore be materially and adversely affected by the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. 
 Because nearly all of our business is conducted outside the U.S., we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Historically, our primary exposures have related to net working capital exposures denominated in currencies other than the foreign subsidiaries functional currency, and remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries net monetary assets from the subsidiaries local currency into the subsidiaries functional currency. In general, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar could require certain of our foreign subsidiaries to record translation and remeasurement gains. Conversely, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar could require certain of our foreign subsidiaries to record losses on translation and remeasurement. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in U.S. dollars, and a weakened U.S. dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials, both of which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows. Our primary exposures include the Singapore Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, Philippine Peso, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollar, South Korean Won, Israeli Shekel, Malaysian Ringgit and Euro. Although we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts from time to time to hedge our operating expenses against certain foreign currency exposure, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful and may result in a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. 
 Changes to our existing tax incentive in Singapore may materially reduce our reported results of operations in future periods. 
 Our existing tax incentive, scheduled to expire in January 2025, allows certain classes of income to be subject to reduced income tax rates in Singapore provided we meet certain employment and investment conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with these conditions, we could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized with respect to this tax incentive. There cannot be assurances that we are able to benefit from future tax incentives granted by the Singapore government beyond the expiration of our existing tax incentive. In the absence of any tax incentive, the income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply is 17 , which would result in a significant increase in our provision for (benefit from) income taxes in future periods. 
 Changes in tax legislation could adversely impact our future profitability. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws and regulations are continuously evolving with corporate tax reform, base-erosion efforts, global minimum tax, and increased transparency continuing to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Although the timing and methods of implementation may vary, many countries, including those in the Asia/Pacific region in which we have significant operations, have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, legislation or practices inspired by the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD ), for example, Pillar Two. While we do not expect Pillar Two to have a material tax impact in fiscal 2025, we will continue to monitor new tax legislation and other developments since changes in tax legislation, or in the interpretation of existing legislation, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 Other changes in taxation could materially impact our future effective tax rate. 
 Additionally, our future effective tax rate could be affected by numerous other factors including higher or lower than anticipated foreign earnings in various jurisdictions where we are subjected to tax rates that differ from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, by changes in the valuation allowances recorded against certain deferred tax balances, or 
 26

 by changes in accounting principles and reporting requirements, or including the interpretations and application of such accounting principles and reporting requirements. Changes in our assertion for foreign earnings, whether permanently or non-permanently reinvested, as a result of changes in facts and circumstances or challenges by tax authorities to our historic or future tax positions and transfer pricing policies, could also significantly adversely impact our future effective tax rate. 
 Risks Related to Our Shares and Corporate Law 
 We have the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock. 
 We may from time to time issue additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, which would result in dilution of our existing shareholders equity interests in us. Our board of directors has the authority to issue, without vote or action of shareholders, preferred shares in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred shares could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. In addition, we are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, up to an aggregate of 200 million common stock, of which approximately 53.9 million shares were outstanding as of September 28, 2024. We are also authorized to issue, without shareholder approval (except as required by the rules of the Nasdaq stock market), securities convertible into either common stock or preferred stock. We may issue such shares in connection with financing transactions, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions or other purposes. In addition, our shareholders will experience additional dilution when performance or restricted share units vest and settle, when we issue equity awards to our employees under our equity incentive plans, or when we otherwise issue additional equity. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and under Pennsylvania law may discourage other companies from attempting to acquire us. 
 Some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws as well as Pennsylvania law may discourage some transactions where we would otherwise experience a fundamental change. For example, our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that: 
 classify our board of directors into four classes, with one class being elected each year; 
 permit our board to issue blank check preferred shares without shareholder approval; and 
 prohibit us from engaging in some types of business combinations with a holder of 20 or more of our voting securities without super-majority board or shareholder approval. 
 Further, under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, because our shareholders approved bylaw provisions that provide for a classified board of directors, shareholders may remove directors only for cause. These provisions and some other provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law could delay, defer or prevent us from experiencing a fundamental change and may adversely affect our common shareholders' voting and other rights. 
 If our internal controls over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in the trading price of our common stock. 
 As a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to revise or restate our financial results. This could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the material weakness, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation, adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.

 Item 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy 
 We rely on information systems and the data stored on them to conduct our operations. We have adopted and maintain a cybersecurity risk management program, as a subset of our broader enterprise risk management program, which is designed in accordance with our risk profile and business. Our cybersecurity risk management program has been informed by industry standards, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework NIST CSF ). 
 Our cybersecurity risk management program incorporates multiple components, including, but not limited to, policies, guidelines, procedures, infrastructure, and systems that are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our critical systems and information. 
 Elements of our cybersecurity risk management process include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Annual cybersecurity risk assessments of critical infrastructure and systems; 
 Annual vulnerability scans and penetration testing; 
 Mandatory, bi-annual cybersecurity awareness training for all employees, including phishing exercises; and 
 An overarching written information security policy and written cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents. 
 We leverage IT service providers to perform penetration testing and support our cybersecurity awareness training program. We oversee cybersecurity risks related to third-party IT cloud service providers who have access to our systems and data. We require certain IT cloud service providers to complete cloud-based cybersecurity assessments. 
 We have not identified any cybersecurity incidents or threats that have materially affected us or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, like other companies in our industry, we and our third-party vendors have from time to time experienced cybersecurity threats and other security incidents that have affected our information or systems. We have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. 
 For additional information on certain risks associated with cybersecurity, including with respect to prior cybersecurity incidents, please refer to We may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on us in Item 1A: Risk Factors . 
 Cybersecurity Governance 
 Our Board of Directors (the Board has delegated responsibility for enterprise risk management, including cybersecurity risk oversight, to our Audit Committee (the Committee ). The Committee receives quarterly information security updates from our Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Information Technology VP of IT ). The Committee in turn reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity, on at least a bi-annual basis. 
 The VP of IT has twenty seven years of experience in information technology, fifteen of which have involved IT leadership for various organizations. Our Director, IT Governance and Security (the Director, IT reports to our VP of IT and is responsible for the day-to-day management of our cybersecurity risk management program. The Director, IT has eighteen years of experience in information technology. The Director, IT receives support from our operational team which comprises cybersecurity, IT, controllership, and legal professionals who regularly review cybersecurity matters and evaluate emerging threats, as well as act as first responders to triage any cybersecurity incidents.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, net revenue and expenses during the reporting periods, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to accounts receivable, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, carrying value and lives of fixed assets, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, equity-based compensation expense and warranties. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. As a result, we make judgments regarding the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and assumptions are used as the basis for making estimates, and on an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 We believe the following critical accounting policies, which have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 In accordance with ASC No. 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. In general, the Company generates revenue from product sales, either directly to customers or to distributors. In determining whether a contract exists, we evaluate the terms of the agreement, the relationship with the customer or distributor and their ability to pay. 
 The Company recognizes revenue from sales of our products, including sales to our distributors, at a point in time, generally upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where applicable, when the customer has accepted the products or upon expiration of the acceptance period. For sales to distributors, payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products.

 Our business is subject to contingencies related to customer orders, including: 
 Right of Return : A large portion of our revenue comes from the sale of equipment used in the semiconductor assembly process. Other product sales relate to consumable products, which are sold in high-volume quantities, and are generally maintained at low stock levels at the customer s facility. Customer returns have historically represented a very small percentage of customer sales on an annual basis. 
 Warranties : Our equipment is generally shipped with a one-year warranty against manufacturing defects. We establish reserves for estimated warranty expense when revenue for the related equipment is recognized. The reserve for estimated warranty expense is based upon historical experience and management s estimate of future expenses, including product parts replacement, freight charges and labor costs expected to be incurred to correct product failures during the warranty period. 
 Conditions of Acceptance: Sales of our consumable products generally do not have customer acceptance terms. In certain cases, sales of our equipment have customer acceptance clauses which may require the equipment to perform in accordance with customer specifications or when installed at the customer s facility. In such cases, if the terms of acceptance are satisfied at our facility prior to shipment, the revenue for the equipment will be recognized upon shipment. If the terms of acceptance are satisfied at our customers facilities, the revenue for the equipment will not be recognized until acceptance, which is typically obtained after installation and testing, is received from the customer. 
 Service revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are performed. 
 The Company measures revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Any variable consideration such as sales incentives are recognized as a reduction of net revenue at the time of revenue recognition. 
 The Company s performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year, therefore as allowed under ASC 606, we have opted not to disclose the unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with original expected durations of less than one year. 
 The length of time between invoicing and payment is not significant under our payment terms. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recognized in net revenue. 
 Shipping and handling costs paid by the Company are included in cost of sales. 
 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We are subject to concentrations of customers and sales to a few geographic locations, which could also impact the collectability of certain receivables. If global or regional economic conditions deteriorate or political conditions were to change in some of the countries where we do business, it could have a significant impact on our results of operations, and our ability to realize the full value of our accounts receivable. 
 Inventories 
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. We generally provide reserves for obsolete inventory and for inventory considered to be in excess of demand. Demand is generally defined as 18 months forecasted future consumption for equipment, 24 months forecasted future consumption for spare parts, and 12 months forecasted future consumption for tools. Forecasted consumption is based upon internal projections, historical sales volumes, customer order activity and a review of consumable inventory levels at customers facilities. We communicate forecasts of our future consumption to our suppliers and adjust commitments to those suppliers accordingly. If required, we reserve the difference between the carrying value of our inventory and the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon projections about future consumption, and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projections, additional inventory reserves may be required. 
 Inventory reserve provision for certain subsidiaries is determined based on management s estimate of future consumption for equipment and spare parts. This estimate is based on historical sales volumes, internal projections and market developments and trends.

 Accounting for Impairment of Goodwill 
 ASC No. 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, a company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then performing the impairment test is unnecessary. However, if a company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the goodwill impairment test. The Company s impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and determining if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. 
 As part of the annual evaluation, the Company performs an impairment test of its goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year to coincide with the completion of its annual forecasting and refreshing of its business outlook processes. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors if a triggering event has occurred that may have the effect of reducing the fair value of a reporting unit below its respective carrying value. Adverse changes in expected operating results and/or unfavorable changes in other economic factors used to estimate fair values could result in a non-cash impairment charge in the future. 
 Impairment assessments inherently involve judgment as to the assumptions made about the expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Future events and changing market conditions may impact the assumptions as to prices, costs, growth rates or other factors that may result in changes in the estimates of future cash flows. Although the Company believes the assumptions that it has used in testing for impairment are reasonable, significant changes in any one of the assumptions could produce a significantly different result. Indicators of potential impairment, including significant and unforeseen customer losses, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, a significant adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a significant stock price decline or unanticipated competition, may lead the Company to perform interim goodwill impairment assessments. 
 The Company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and elected to perform the quantitative impairment test as permitted by ASC 350. Based on the quantitative assessment performed on all its reporting units, the Company concluded that no impairment on the Company's recorded goodwill was required. The persistent macroeconomic headwinds could, in the future, require changes to assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the reporting units which could result in future goodwill impairment charges. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our products. The discount rate utilized in our valuation model could also be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital. For further information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
 Income Taxes 
 In accordance with ASC No. 740 , Income Taxes , deferred income taxes are determined using the balance sheet method. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount expected, on a more likely than not basis, to be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if it were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period when such determination is made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period when such determination is made. 
 The Company determines the amount of unrecognized tax benefit with respect to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on its income tax returns in accordance with ASC No. 740 Topic 10, Income Taxes, General ASC 740.10 ). Under ASC 740.10, the Company utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Step one, or recognition, requires a company to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination solely based on its technical merit. Step two, or measurement, is based on the largest amount of benefit, which is more likely than not to be realized on settlement with the taxing authority, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.

 Equity-Based Compensation 
 The Company accounts for equity-based compensation under the provisions of ASC No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation ASC 718 ). ASC 718 requires the recognition of the fair value of the equity-based compensation in net income. Compensation expense associated with Relative TSR Performance Share Units is determined using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, and compensation expense associated with time-based and Growth Performance Share Units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the fair value on the date of grant. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a summary of the terms of these performance-based awards. The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and the Company elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after the adoption of ASC 718. 
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 Bookings and Backlog 
 Our backlog consists of customer orders scheduled for shipment within the next twelve months. A booking is recorded when a customer order is reviewed and it is determined that all specifications can be met, production (or service) can be scheduled, a delivery date can be set, and the customer meets our credit requirements. We use bookings to evaluate the results of our operations, generate future operating plans and assess the performance of our Company. While we believe that this measure is useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate bookings differently or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Reconciliation of bookings to net revenue is not practicable. A majority of our orders are subject to cancellation or deferral by our customers with limited or no penalties. Also, customer demand for our products can vary dramatically without prior notice. Because of the volatility of customer demand, possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations and potential delays in product shipments, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of net revenue for any succeeding period.

 The semiconductor industry is volatile and our operating results are adversely impacted by volatile worldwide economic conditions. Though the semiconductor industry s cycle can be independent of the general economy, global economic conditions may have a direct impact on demand for semiconductor units and ultimately demand for semiconductor capital equipment and expendable tools. Accordingly, our business and financial performance is impacted, both positively and negatively, by fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. Our visibility into future demand is generally limited and forecasting is difficult. There can be no assurances regarding levels of demand for our products and we believe historical industry-wide volatility will persist. 
 The U.S. and several other countries have levied tariffs on certain goods. In particular, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating since 2018, with U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. These have resulted in uncertainties in the semiconductor, LED, memory and automotive markets. While the Company anticipates long-term growth in semiconductor consumption, we observed trade-related adverse impacts in demand from China, which continues to persist in fiscal 2024 and beyond. 
 Net Revenue 
 Our net revenues for fiscal 2024 decreased as compared to our net revenues for fiscal 2023. The decrease in net revenue is primarily due to lower volume in Wedge Bonding Equipment, Advanced Solutions and All Others, offset by the higher volumes in Ball Bonding Equipment as further outlined in the tables presented immediately below.

 The following table reflects the summarized Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows information for fiscal 2024 and 2023: 
 Fiscal (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 31,037 173,404 Net cash used in investing activities (138,501) (91,338) Net cash used in financing activities (196,100) (111,876) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1,309 3,675 Changes in cash, and cash equivalents (302,255) (26,135) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 529,402 555,537 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 227,147 529,402 
 Fiscal 2024 
 Net cash provided by operating activities consisted of net loss of 69.0 million, non-cash adjustments of 179.3 million and a net unfavourable change in operating assets and liabilities of 79.2 million. The non-cash adjustments were primarily due to impairment charges of 44.5 million and inventory write-down of 57.3 million as a result of the cancellation of the Project. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in accounts and notes receivable of 34.7 million, an increase in inventories of 31.5 million, and a decrease in income tax payable of 17.7 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 9.1 million. 
 The increase in accounts and other receivable was primarily due to the timing of payments due. The increase in inventories was due to the buildup of long lead time materials to fulfill certain customer purchase orders. The decrease in income tax payable is primarily due to the current year payment of the U.S. one-time transition tax and tax benefit from the U.S. Tax Court opinion in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner . The decrease in prepaid expenses was mainly due the transfer of contract assets to net account receivables. 
 The net cash used in investing activities was due to net purchase of short-term investments of 120.0 million, capital expenditures of 16.1 million and investment in a private equity fund of 2.4 million. 
 The net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to common stock repurchases of 150.8 million and dividend payments of 44.2 million. 
 Fiscal 2023 
 Net cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of 57.1 million, non-cash adjustments of 73.8 million and a net favorable change in operating assets and liabilities of 42.4 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable of 152.7 million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of 8.6 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 52.3 million, and income tax payable of 29.3 million, and an increase in inventories of 35.8 million. 
 The decrease in accounts and other receivable was primarily due to lower sales in fiscal 2023. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily due to higher payments to suppliers, lower material purchases and lower accrued employee compensation that was paid out in the period. The increase in inventories was due to slower utilization in the period and buildup of long lead time materials to fulfill certain customer purchase orders. The decrease in income tax payable was primarily due to lower profitability. 
 The net cash used in investing activities was due to net purchase of short-term investments of 10.0 million, cash outflow for the acquisition of Advanced Jet Automation Co., Ltd. of 36.9 million and capital expenditures of 44.4 million. 
 The net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to common stock repurchases of 69.2 million and dividend payments of 42.0 million.

 Fiscal 2025 Liquidity and Capital Resource Outlook 
 We expect our fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be between 13.0 million and 17.0 million. The actual amounts for fiscal 2025 will vary depending on market conditions. Expenditures are anticipated to be primarily used for research and development projects, enhancements to our manufacturing operations, improvements to our information technology security, ongoing implementation of our enterprise resource planning system and leasehold improvements for our facilities. Our ability to make these expenditures will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing macroeconomic conditions, trade tensions, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, tensions in the Middle East, and the prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, approximately 302.6 million and 576.9 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries, respectively, with a large portion of the cash amounts expected to be available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. income tax. The decrease is primarily due to the repatriation of cash held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. 
 The Company s operations and capital requirements are funded primarily by cash on hand, cash generated by foreign operating activities and cash from our existing Facility Agreements. We believe these sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our additional liquidity needs for the foreseeable future including repayment of any outstanding balances under our existing Facility Agreements, as well as payment of dividends, share repurchases and income taxes. 
 We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, existing Facility Agreements, and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements, notwithstanding the macroeconomic headwinds, for the next twelve months and beyond. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some based on normal operations of our business and others related to macroeconomic conditions including inflationary pressures, industry-related uncertainties, and effects arising from the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict, which we cannot predict. We also cannot predict economic conditions and industry downturns or the timing, strength or duration of recoveries. We intend to continue to use our cash for working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. 
 In this unprecedented macroeconomic environment, and as a result of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict or for other reasons, we may seek, as we believe appropriate, additional debt or equity financing which would provide capital for corporate purposes, working capital funding, additional liquidity needs or to fund future growth opportunities, including possible acquisitions. The timing and amount of potential capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including our actual and projected demand for our products, semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industry conditions, competitive factors, the condition of financial markets and the global economic situation. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On August 15, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a program (the "Program") to repurchase up to 100 million of the Company s common stock on or before August 1, 2020. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization under the Program to 200 million, 300 million and 400 million, respectively. On March 3, 2022, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization under the Program by an additional 400 million to 800 million, and extended its duration through August 1, 2025. On November 17, 2023, the Company modified its written trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, dated as of May 7, 2022, to facilitate repurchases under the Program. The modification provided for the purchase of up to approximately 169 million of the Company s common stock from November 20, 2023 through August 1, 2025. The Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and is funded using the Company s available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased through open market and/or privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the Program depend on market conditions as well as corporate and regulatory considerations.

Table of Contents 

 During the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, the Company repurchased a total of approximately 3,221.0 thousand shares of common stock at a cost of approximately 151.0 million. The stock repurchases were recorded in the periods they were delivered and accounted for as treasury stock in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company records treasury stock purchases under the cost method using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Upon re-issuance of treasury stock, amounts in excess of the acquisition cost are credited to additional paid-in capital. If the Company reissues treasury stock at an amount below its acquisition cost and additional paid-in capital associated with prior treasury stock transactions is insufficient to cover the difference between acquisition cost and the reissue price, this difference is recorded against retained earnings. 
 As of September 28, 2024, our remaining stock repurchase authorization under the Program was approximately 30.3 million. 
 Dividends 
 On August 26, 2024, May 16, 2024, March 14, 2024 and November 15, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend 0.20 per share of common stock, resulting in an aggregate dividend of 0.80 per share of common stock for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that such dividends are in the best interests of the Company s stockholders. 
 Other Obligations and Contingent Payments 
 In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, certain obligations and commitments as of September 28, 2024 are appropriately not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations in this Form 10-K. However, because these obligations and commitments are entered into in the normal course of business and because they may have a material impact on our liquidity, we have disclosed them in the table below. 
 Additionally, as of September 28, 2024, the Company had deferred tax liabilities of 34.6 million and unrecognized tax benefit recorded within the income tax payable for uncertain tax positions of 21.4 million, including related accrued interest of 3.7 million. These amounts are not included in the contractual obligation table below because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these payments at this time. 
 The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 28, 2024:

 Credit Facilities 
 On February 15, 2019, the Company entered into a Facility Letter and Overdraft Agreement (collectively, the Facility Agreements with MUFG Bank, Ltd., Singapore Branch (the Bank ). The Facility Agreements provide the Company and one of its subsidiaries with an overdraft facility of up to 150.0 million (the Overdraft Facility for general corporate purposes. Amounts outstanding under the Overdraft Facility, including interest, are payable upon thirty days written demand by the Bank. Interest on the Overdraft Facility is calculated on a daily basis, and the applicable interest rate is calculated at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a margin of 1.5 per annum. The Overdraft Facility is an unsecured facility per the terms of the Facility Agreements. The Facility Agreements contain customary non-financial covenants, including, without limitation, covenants that restrict the Company s ability to sell or dispose of its assets, cease owning at least 51 of two of its subsidiaries (the Subsidiaries ), or encumber its assets with material security interests (including any pledge of monies in the Subsidiaries cash deposit account with the Bank). The Facility Agreements also contain customary events of default, including, without limitation, non-payment of financial obligations when due, cross defaults to other material indebtedness of the Company and any breach of a representation or warranty under the Facility Agreements. As of September 28, 2024, there were no outstanding amounts under the Overdraft Facility. 
 As of September 28, 2024, other than the bank guarantee disclosed in Note 10, we did not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements, such as contingent interests or obligations associated with variable interest entities. 

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our available-for-sale securities, if applicable, may consist of short-term investments in highly rated debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies, financial institutions, and corporations. We continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of issuers with respect to any available-for-sale securities and target an average life to maturity of less than 18 months. Accordingly, we believe that the effects to us of changes in interest rates and credit ratings of issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our international operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to transactions denominated in currencies other than the location s functional currency. Our international operations are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations that impact the remeasurement of net monetary assets of those operations whose functional currency, the U.S. dollar, differs from their respective local currencies, most notably in Israel and Singapore. Our U.S. operations also have foreign currency exposure due to net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition to net monetary remeasurement, we have exposures related to the translation of subsidiary financial statements from their functional currency, the local currency, into its reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, most notably in the Netherlands, China, Taiwan, Japan and Germany. 
 Based on our foreign currency exposure as of September 28, 2024, a 10.0 fluctuation could impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows by 4.0 to 5.0 million. Our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful and may result in a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flow. 
 We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency-denominated expenses in the normal course of business and, accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. These instruments generally mature within twelve months. We have foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional amount of 46.2 million outstanding as of September 28, 2024.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements; and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Valuation of inventories - Reserves for excess and obsolete raw materials 
 As described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated net inventory balance was 177.7 million. The Company generally provides reserves for obsolete inventory and for inventory considered to be in excess of demand. Demand is generally defined as forecasted future consumption for inventories, and is based upon internal projections, historical sales volumes, customer order activity and a review of consumable inventory levels at customers facilities. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the reserves for excess and obsolete raw materials, is a critical audit matter are our assessment that this is an area of significant judgment by management when developing reserves for excess and obsolete raw materials, including developing the assumptions related to forecasted future consumption for raw materials. This has in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the reasonableness of management s significant assumptions related to the forecasted future consumption for raw materials. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s reserves for excess and obsolete raw materials, including controls over management s assumptions related to forecasted future consumption for raw materials. These procedures also included, among others, testing management s process for developing the reserves for excess or obsolete raw materials; evaluating the appropriateness of management s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management s assumptions related to forecasted future consumption for raw materials.

 Relative TSR Performance Share Units Relative TSR PSUs entitle the employee to receive common stock of the Company on the award vesting date, typically the third anniversary of the grant date (or as soon as administratively practicable if later), if market performance objectives which measure relative total shareholder return TSR are attained.

 Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 28, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. 
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the framework established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. 
 Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of September 28, 2024, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 28, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Authorized Capital Stock 
 
 The authorized shares of the Company consist of two hundred million (200,000,000) shares of common stock without par value Common Stock ), and five million (5,000,000) shares of preferred stock without par value Preferred Stock ). As of November 11, 2024, there were 53,871,256 shares of the Company s Common Stock outstanding, and no shares of Preferred Stock were outstanding. 
 
 The Company s board of directors may, without further action by the shareholders, issue a series of Preferred Stock and fix the rights and preference of those shares, including the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, exchange rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption price or prices, liquidation and other preferences and priorities and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series. The rights of the holders of Common Stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any Preferred Stock so issued. All of the five million authorized shares of Preferred Stock are currently undesignated. 
 
 Description of Common Stock 
 
 Each share of the Company s Common Stock has the same rights and privileges. Holders of Common Stock do not have any preferences or any preemptive, conversion or exchange rights. All of our outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and nonassessable. 
 
 Voting Rights 
 
 The holders of Common Stock of the Company are entitled to vote upon all matters submitted to a vote of the Company s shareholders and are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held. 
 
 Quorum Voting Standards 
 
 The presence of a majority of the common shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum. 
 
 In all elections for directors, the By-Laws provide that cumulative voting is allowed, meaning that holders of Common Stock may multiply the number of votes they are entitled to cast by the total number of directors to be elected at a meeting of shareholders and cast the whole number of votes for one candidate or distribute them among some or all candidates. For other routine matters, the voting standard for approval of a proposal is the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote. However, in the context of some business combinations, the voting standards differ, as described further in the section below titled Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Articles, By-Laws and Pennsylvania Law. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 Subject to the prior rights and preferences, if any, applicable to shares of Preferred Stock or any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to participate ratably in dividends, payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be declared by the board of directors out of any funds legally available for the payment of dividends. Each such distribution will be payable to holders of record as they appear on our stock transfer books on such record dates as may be fixed by the board of directors.

 The board of directors, without shareholder approval, may issue one or more series of Preferred Stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or economic rights of the holders of Common Stock. If the Company issues Preferred Stock, it may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control. 
 
 Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Articles, By-Laws and Pennsylvania Law 
 
 Some sections of the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and provisions of Pennsylvania law may discourage certain transactions involving a change in control of the Company. 
 
 The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that (i) classify the board of directors into four classes, with one class being elected each year, (ii) permit the board to issue blank check Preferred Stock without shareholder approval, and (iii) prohibit the Company from engaging in certain business combinations with a holder of 20 or more of our shares without super-majority board or shareholder approval. Further, under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, because the By-Laws provide for a classified board of directors, shareholders may only remove directors for cause. 
 
 The Company has opted out of several provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law that could have the effect of delaying or interfering with a proposed change of control, but is also subject to other provisions of that law which could have those effects. The directors are subject to a provision of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law that permits them to consider the interests of constituencies other than the shareholders when deciding what will be in the best interests of the Company. In addition, the Company is subject to two statutory provisions that are similar to the last provision of the Articles of Incorporation described above. These statutory provisions impose certain price and other requirements, and special approvals before a holder of 20 or more of shares may engage in certain transactions.

 defined below), Disability (as defined in Section 422(c) of the Code) or death, the Participant (or in the event of death, the Participant s beneficiary) shall be eligible to vest in a pro rata portion of the Performance Share Units subject to the Award that the Participant would otherwise have vested based on the actual achievement of the Performance Measures as determined at the end of the Performance Period had he or she remained employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries through the end of the Performance Period. The pro rata portion will be calculated based on full months as measured from the grant date to the corresponding day of each succeeding month prior to such termination of employment. If the Participant terminates employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries for any other reason, all unvested Performance Share Units at the time of such termination of employment shall be forfeited. 
 For purposes of the foregoing, (x) a Mutually Agreed Retirement means that the Board and the Participant have mutually agreed on Participant s termination of employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries that is consistent with the Company s succession plan for the Company s CEO, and (y) a Voluntary Retirement means Participant has unilaterally elected to terminate employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries on or after attaining age 50 and completing at least three years of continuous employment with the Company and or its Subsidiaries, provided the sum of the Participant s age and years of continuous employment with the Company and or its Subsidiaries equals or exceeds 60. 
 In each case, Shares attributable to the prorated Performance Share Units subject to this Award shall be delivered to the Participant as soon as administratively practicable following the Vesting Date but no later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the calendar year in which the Vesting Date occurs. 
 5. Adjustment in Capitalization . In the event of any equity restructuring (within the meaning of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation), the Shares subject to this Award shall be treated as set forth in Section 7.6 of the Plan. 
 6. Change in Control . In the event of a Change in Control, the Award shall be treated as set forth in Section 7.7 of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Participant remains employed by the Company through a Change in Control (or the Award remains eligible for vesting in the event of a Mutually Agreed Retirement or Voluntary Retirement that satisfies the conditions of Section 4 above) and the surviving or successor entity does not assume, substitute, or continue the Award, the Participant shall vest in the Performance Share Units immediately prior to the closing of the Change in Control with such vesting based on (i) if the Change in Control is consummated within the first year of the Performance Period, target achievement of the Performance Measures, or (ii) if the Change in Control is consummated after the first year of the Performance Period, actual achievement of the Performance Measures as of the Change in Control, as determined by the Committee. For purposes of clarity, the Performance Share Units shall vest based on the foregoing sentence immediately prior to the closing of the Change in Control rather than at the end of the Performance Period. In the event a Change in Control occurs and the surviving or successor entity agrees to assume this outstanding Award and the Participant is terminated by the Company or the successor entity without Cause within twenty-four (24) months after the Change in Control, then the Award shall vest on such date of termination based on (i) if the date of termination occurs within the first year of the Performance Period, target achievement of the Performance Measures, or (ii) if the date of termination occurs after the first year of the Performance Period, actual achievement of the Performance Measures as of the date of termination, as determined by the Committee. 
 
 For purposes hereof, Cause shall mean, unless otherwise provided in an employment agreement between the Company and the Participant, a determination by the Company that the Participant was or should have been dismissed as a result of (i) any material breach by the Participant of any agreement between the Participant and the Company (ii) any material violation by the Participant of any written policy of the Company, including, without limitation, the Company s Code of Business Conduct (iii) the conviction of, indictment for or plea of nolo contendere by the Participant to a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude (iv) conduct of the Participant, in connection with Participant s employment or service, that has resulted, or could reasonably be expected to result, in material injury to the business or reputation of the Company or (v) any material misconduct or willful and deliberate non-performance (other than by reason of disability) by the Participant of the Participant s duties to the Company. 
 7. Restrictions on Transfer . Performance Share Units may not be sold, assigned, hypothecated, pledged or otherwise transferred or encumbered in any manner except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 

Exhibit 10.16 

 8. Withholding of Taxes . The obligation of the Company to deliver Shares or cash shall be subject to applicable Federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. The Committee may require the Participant to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy the withholding requirements or may, in its discretion, permit or require the Participant, subject to the provisions of the Plan and withholding rules established by the Committee, to satisfy the withholding tax, in whole or in part, by electing to have the Company withhold Shares or cash (or by returning previously acquired Shares to the Company). Such election must be made in compliance with and subject to the withholding rules, and the Company may limit the number of Shares withheld to satisfy the minimum tax withholding requirements to the extent necessary to avoid adverse accounting consequences. 
 9. No Rights as a Shareholder . Until Shares are issued, if at all, in satisfaction of the Company s obligations under this Award, in the time and manner specified above, the Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to such Shares. 
 10. No Right to Continued Employment . Neither the execution and delivery hereof nor the granting of the Award shall constitute or be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to employ or continue the employment of the Participant for any period. 
 11. Clawback Rights . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, this Award is subject to recovery under any law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement and will be subject to such deductions and clawback as may be required pursuant to such law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement (or any policy adopted by the Company pursuant to such law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement). 
 12. Governing Law . The Award and the legal relations between the parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (without reference to the principles of conflicts of law). 
 13. Signature in Counterpart . This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signature thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. 
 14. Binding Effect Benefits . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Participant and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to give any person other than the Company or the Participant or their respective successors or assigns any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of any agreement or any provision contained herein. 
 15. Amendment . This Agreement may not be altered, modified or amended except by a written instrument signed by the Company and the Participant. 
 16. Sections and Other Headings . The section and other headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 
 17. Section 409A . This Award is intended as a short-term deferral, and to not be subject to any tax, penalty, or interest under, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. This Award, this Agreement and the Plan (as to the Award) shall be construed and interpreted consistent with such intent. To the extent that any amounts payable hereunder are determined to constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, such amounts shall be subject to such additional rules and requirements as specified by the Committee from time to time in order to comply with Section 409A, and the settlement of any such amounts may not be accelerated or delayed except to the extent permitted by Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any payment or benefit provided to the Participant in connection with his or her termination of employment is determined to constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A and the Participant is determined to be a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(b)(i), then such payment or benefit shall not be paid until the first payroll date to occur following the six-month anniversary of the termination date (the Specified Employee Payment Date ). The aggregate of any payments that would otherwise have been paid before the Specified Employee Payment Date shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum on the Specified Employee Payment Date and thereafter, any remaining payments shall be paid without delay in accordance with their original schedule. The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Participant or any other person if any payments under any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A and are subject to the 20 percent tax under Section 409A. 
 
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company, by its duly authorized officer, and the Participant has executed this Agreement in duplicate as of the day and year first above written as the Award Date.

 The Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors have established the following Performance Share Plan terms for performance share unit grants. All Performance Share Award grants are made pursuant to the Kulicke & Soffa Industries 2021 Equity Plan. 
 
 Performance Metric Relative Total Shareholder Return 
 Performance for the purposes of determining the vesting of the performance share awards will be based on Relative Total Shareholder Return TSR ). Relative TSR measures the K&S share price movement over a performance period relative to the share price movement (plus accrued dividends, if appropriate) of peer companies.

 The Peer Companies may change over the Performance Period as follows 
 In the event of a merger, acquisition or business combination transaction of a Peer Company with or by another Peer Company, the surviving entity will remain a Peer Company, without adjustment to its financial or market structure. 
 In the event of a merger of a Peer Company with an entity that is not a Peer Company, or the acquisition or business combination transaction by or with a member of the peer group, or with an entity that is not a Peer Company, in each case, where the Peer Company is the surviving entity and remains publicly traded, the surviving entity will remain a Peer Company. 
 In the event of a merger or acquisition or business combination transaction of a Peer Company by or with an entity that is not a Peer Company, a going private transaction involving a Peer 

Exhibit 10.16 

 Company or the liquidation of a Peer Company, where the Peer Company is not a surviving entity or is otherwise no longer publicly traded, the company shall no longer be a Peer Company. 
 
 Changes to the companies comprising the GICS 45301020 (Semiconductors) not including companies traded on the Pink Sheets LLC Exchange over the Performance Period will not change the Peer Companies for the Performance Share Awards made under this plan. 
 
 Beginning Average Price with respect to the Company or any other company in the Peer Group, means the average of the closing stock prices for a share of common stock of the applicable company for the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the first day of the Performance Period. If as of the start of the Performance Period a member of the Peer Group has been publicly traded for less than 90 calendar days, such company s beginning average price shall equal the average of the closing stock prices for a share of common stock of the applicable company over the period during which the company s stock has been publicly traded. 
 
 Target Performance 
 TSR for each of the Peer Companies is calculated and ranked highest to lowest. The Median TSR performance of the Peer Companies is the TSR at which half the Peer Companies TSR results are below and half the Peer Companies TSR results are above. 
 
 Payout Range 
 The percentage of earned Performance Share Units that will ultimately vest will range from 0 to 200 based upon the final positioning of the Company s TSR relative to the median of the Peer Companies at the end of the Performance Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company s TSR during the Performance Period is negative, the percentage of earned Performance Share Units shall not exceed 100 . 
 
 The payout scale below shows the Award vesting percentage at percentile performance points from 25 th to 99 th at 5 percentile point increments. Final Vesting of Performance Share Awards will be interpolated and will be expressed as a full percentage point ranging from 0 to 200 .

The Peer Companies may change over the Performance Period as follows 
 In the event of a merger, acquisition or business combination transaction of a Peer Company with or by another Peer Company, the surviving entity will remain a Peer Company, without adjustment to its financial or market structure. 
 In the event of a merger of a Peer Company with an entity that is not a Peer Company, or the acquisition or business combination transaction by or with a member of the peer group, or with an entity that is not a Peer Company, in each case, where the Peer Company is the surviving entity and remains publicly traded, the surviving entity will remain a Peer Company. 
 In the event of a merger or acquisition or business combination transaction of a Peer Company by or with an entity that is not a Peer Company, a going private transaction involving a Peer 

Exhibit 10.17 

 Company or the liquidation of a Peer Company, where the Peer Company is not a surviving entity or is otherwise no longer publicly traded, the company shall no longer be a Peer Company. 
 
 Changes to the companies comprising the GICS 45301020 (Semiconductors) not including companies traded on the Pink Sheets LLC Exchange over the Performance Period will not change the Peer Companies for the Performance Share Awards made under this plan. 
 
 Beginning Average Price with respect to the Company or any other company in the Peer Group, means the average of the closing stock prices for a share of common stock of the applicable company for the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the first day of the Performance Period. If as of the start of the Performance Period a member of the Peer Group has been publicly traded for less than 90 calendar days, such company s beginning average price shall equal the average of the closing stock prices for a share of common stock of the applicable company over the period during which the company s stock has been publicly traded. 
 
 Target Performance 
 TSR for each of the Peer Companies is calculated and ranked highest to lowest. The Median TSR performance of the Peer Companies is the TSR at which half the Peer Companies TSR results are below and half the Peer Companies TSR results are above. 

Payout Range

Exhibit 10.19 

KULICKE AND SOFFA INDUSTRIES, INC. 
 
 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN 

Purpose 
 The purpose of the Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc. Company or K&S Incentive Compensation Plan Plan or ICP is to 
 focus the efforts of Plan participants to achieve financial goals and individual objectives and maximize personal performance consistent with the Company s business strategy 
 provide Plan participants with the opportunity to earn an annual ICP award based on Corporate and Business Unit BU (if appropriate) financial performance and individual performance 
 align the interests of our employees and K&S shareholders by providing awards that are commensurate with business performance 

Effective Date 
 This Plan document is effective beginning fiscal 2023, commencing on October 2, 2022. This Plan document and its attachments constitute the entire ICP and supersede any other oral or written agreements dated prior to the effective date. The Plan year is aligned to the K&S fiscal Plan year. 

Plan Governance 
 The Management Development and Compensation Committee MDCC of the Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing the overall performance and funding of the Company s incentive plans. Specifically, the MDCC is responsible for 
 determining the criteria and mechanism for funding the Plan 
 determining the suspension or reduction of aggregate ICP awards due to current or projected business performance 
 determining the primary financial performance metrics 
 approving any adjustments to Corporate or BU performance for transition, start-up, or other extraordinary costs and circumstances 
 approving the aggregate annual award amounts 
 approving all objectives, weightings, targets and payouts to individual Executive Officers 
 approving any discretionary adjustments to ICP awards 
 delegating routine Plan administration responsibilities to Company management 

Company management s responsibilities include 
 providing summary information and analysis to the MDCC on an annual basis and presenting the aggregate pool for review and approval by the MDCC 
 facilitating the collection of financial and individual performance results and award recommendations 
 recommending and enforcing eligibility and administration rules, individual ICP target assignments, and the relative performance weightings of Company, BU, and individual performance 
 recommending financial performance metrics and funding scales (including threshold, target and maximum performance) for Company and BU awards 
 coordinating financial planning and accruals as necessary

 interpreting this ICP document and establishing, adopting, or amending any provisions as are necessary for proper administration, consulting where appropriate with the MDCC 

Exhibit 10.19 

Plan Funding 
 Funding of the Plan is based on two metrics Corporate Net Income NI and Corporate Operating Margin OM ). 

Funding Scales 
 The Plan has funding scales for Corporate NI and Corporate OM. Each scale correlates performance results to funding percentages from threshold, to target, to maximum performance. The average of the Corporate NI and Corporate OM funding percentages equals the Corporate Financial Payout which generates the ICP pool. The funding percentages range from zero to 200 of the target according to the Plan funding schedule. 
 
 Corporate NI and Corporate OM funding scales are reviewed and approved by the MDCC on an annual basis. Sample funding scales are shown in Appendix 1. 
 
 Threshold Performance 
 Minimum funding for the Plan requires achievement of threshold Corporate NI and Corporate OM performance. If only one of the two thresholds is achieved, funding will be based on the funding scale for the metric that achieved threshold, and only up to 50 of the Plan will be funded. If neither of the two thresholds is achieved, the Plan will not fund and there will not be a payout. Corporate NI and Corporate OM thresholds are reviewed and approved by the MDCC on an annual basis. 

Eligibility 
 To be eligible for payment from the ICP an employee must be 
 classified as regular full-time or regular part-time 
 in a Professional, Management or Executive level position (grade levels P1-P7, M1-M6, E1-E5) 
 active on the Company payroll at the start of the fiscal year and 
 active on the Company payroll on the last working day of the fiscal year (also see Plan Administration section for new hire or job change eligibility). 
 
 Other Incentive Plans 
 Participants in the ICP will not be eligible to participate concurrently in any other Company provided incentive or sales compensation program (i.e. Sales Incentive Plan SIP )). Employees in locations with bonus months normally paid in addition to the standard 12-month payroll or with non-Company-wide bonus plans (i.e. production bonus) will not be excluded from the SS Plan because of those situations. 

Performance Measures, Performance Components and Award Calculations 
 The performance measurement period is the full fiscal year and payout will be based on full fiscal year financial results (defined below) annually. 
 
 Performance Measures 
 There are four performance measures to determine a participant s annual award. 
 Corporate Net Income at the close of the fiscal year 
 Corporate Operating Margin at the close of the fiscal year 
 Business Unit Scorecard at the close of the fiscal year 
 BU Scorecards are set on an annual basis by a Scorecard Committee consisting of the CEO, CFO, and the BU Heads 
 The BU Scorecard metrics consist of financial components (BU Revenue and BU Direct Operating Margin) and non-financial components deemed important to drive sustainable success in the marketplace such as research and development, market share and customer penetration, and quality goals 
 Individual Performance based on the employee s Performance Rating on a scale of 1-5 

Exhibit 10.19 

 For participants in Corporate roles, the financial performance measures consist of Corporate NI and Corporate OM, each weighted 50 . 
 
 For participants in BU roles, the financial measures consist of Corporate Financial Performance and the BU Scorecard results. 
 If a participant s role involves working with two BUs that participant may have a split BU in which the BU Scorecard result for each will be used. In a split BU one of the BUs must be allocated at least 20 of the full BU component weighting. Allocation of split BUs must be in increments of 10 . 

Performance Components 
 Two performance components are used to calculate awards, the financial component and the individual component. The weightings of each component are based on the participant s grade level, and whether the participant is in a Corporate or BU position. 
 
 Note For the Executive Leadership Team ELT the calculation of awards is based on Corporate Financial Performance only. 
 Weighting of Financial Performance Measures - For Participants in Corporate Positions Career Level Salary Grade Financial Individual Corp NI Corp OM VP Below ELT E1 37.5 37.5 25.0 Directors M5-M6 30.0 30.0 40.0 Management M1-M4 25.0 25.0 50.0 Professional P1-P7 20.0 20.0 60.0 
 
 Weighting of Financial Performance Measures - For Participants Associated With a BU Career Level Salary Grade Financial Individual Corp NI Corp OM BU Scorecard VP Below ELT E1 25.0 25.0 35.0 15.0 Directors M5-M6 20.0 20.0 30.0 30.0 Management M1-M4 15.0 15.0 20.0 50.0 Professional P1-P7 12.0 12.0 16.0 60.0 
 
 Individual Component 
 The ICP Individual Component award pool is calculated as the sum of all participants individual ICP target multiplied by the individual component weighting modified by the Corporate Financial Performance. Managers will allocate the individual component for each participant based on the available pool and considering the participant s individual performance rating. 
 
 Incentive Target 
 Participant s ICP target is based on a percentage of the employee s annual base salary. Targets are determined for each grade level based on market competitive practice. Targets for the ELT are individually market priced. The ICP target structure is shown in Appendix 2. 
 
 Individual awards can range from 0 to 200 of the target incentive (capped at 200 of target incentive). 
 
 Calculation Methodology 
 Corporate NI, Corporate OM and BU Scorecard performance measures are based on actual achievement against targets according to the funding scale. 
 
 Corporate Financial Payout is calculated as the average of the Corporate NI payout funding and Corporate OM payout funding. The maximum Corporate Financial Payout is 200 . 

Exhibit 10.19 

 Individual Component Payout is modified by the Corporate Financial Payout. 
 
 BU Scorecard Payout is modified by the Corporate Financial Payout and the Individual Component Payout. 
 
 Calculation of Awards 

Sample Calculations are shown in Appendix 3. 

Exhibit 10.19 

 Payment Form and Timing 
 All awards will be paid in cash (via check or direct deposit), subject to all tax and withholding under applicable country laws and regulations, and Company policy in effect at the time.

 a. using it to transact in securities of the Company, which include common stock, options to purchase common stock, any other type of securities that the Company may issue (such as preferred stock, convertible debentures, warrants and exchange-traded options), and any derivative securities that provide the economic equivalent of ownership of any the Company s securities or an opportunity, direct or indirect, to profit from any change in the value of the Company s securities, except for trades made pursuant to plans approved by the General Counsel in accordance with this policy that are intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act (see Section F 10b5-1 Trading Plans )) 
 b. disclosing it to other directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, agents or other service providers whose roles do not require them to have the information 
 c. disclosing it to anyone outside of the Company, including family, friends, business associates, investors or consulting firms, without prior written authorization from the General Counsel and or 
 d. using it to express an opinion or make a recommendation about trading in the Company s securities. 
 In addition, material nonpublic information about another company that you learn through your job at the Company is subject to these same restrictions around disclosure and trading. If you are in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company s suppliers, customers, competitors or a target company that is potentially subject of an acquisition, joint venture or any other form of business collaboration involving the Company, you and your Affiliates cannot use that information to trade securities of that company, give trading advice about that company, tip or disclose that information, pass that information on to others, or engage in any other action to take advantage of that information. Any such action will be deemed a violation of this Policy. 
 If your work regularly involves handling or discussing confidential information of one of our partners, suppliers or customers, you should consult with the General Counsel before trading in any of that company s securities. 
 
 3. No Disclosure of Confidential Information. 
 You may not at any time disclose material nonpublic information about the Company or about another company that you obtained in connection with your service with the Company to friends, family members or any other person or entity that the Company has not authorized to know such information. In addition, you must handle the confidential information of others in accordance with any related non-disclosure agreements and other obligations that the Company has with them and limit your use of the confidential information to the purpose for which it was disclosed. 
 The fact that the Company has imposed a Special Blackout Period (as defined below) is always deemed confidential information. All Insiders are prohibited from disclosing to anyone that the Company has imposed a Special Blackout Period. 

Exhibit 10.21 

Third parties may ask you for information concerning the Company. You must not discuss internal matters with, or disseminate internal information to, anyone outside of the Company, except as required in the performance of their duties with the Company and, if appropriate, after a confidentiality agreement is in place. This prohibition applies particularly to inquiries concerning the Company from the media, market professionals (such as securities analysts, institutional investors, investment advisers, brokers and dealers) and security holders. All responses to inquiries on behalf of the Company must be made only by the Company s authorized spokespersons in line with the Corporate Communications section set out in the Company s Code of Business Conduct. 
 4. Definition of Material Nonpublic Information 
 This Policy prohibits you from trading in a company s securities if you are in possession of information about the company that is both material and nonpublic. If you have a question whether certain information you are aware of is material or has been made public, you should consult with the General Counsel. 
 Material information means information that a reasonable investor would be substantially likely to consider important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell securities of a company or view as significantly altering the total mix of information available in the marketplace about a company as an issuer of the securities. In general, any information (whether positive or negative) that could reasonably be expected to affect the market price of a security is likely to be material. It is not possible to define all categories of material information. 
 However, some examples of information that could be regarded as material include, but are not limited to 
 a. financial results, key metrics, financial condition, earnings pre-announcements, guidance, projections or forecasts 
 b. earnings or revenue that are inconsistent with the consensus expectations of the investment community 
 c. actual or potential restatements of financial results, or material impairments, write-offs or restructurings 
 d. changes in independent auditors, or notification that a company may no longer rely on an audit report 
 e. actual or potential changes in the executive leadership or the Board of Directors 
 f. business plans or budgets, including quarterly business reviews and similar periodic business analysis and updates 
 g. creation of significant financial obligations, or any significant default under or acceleration of any financial obligation 
 h. impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems 
 i. significant developments involving business relationships, including execution, modification or termination of significant agreements or orders with customers, suppliers, distributors, manufacturers or other business partners 
 j. significant information relating to business operations, such as new products or services, major modifications or performance issues, defects or recalls, significant pricing changes or other announcements of a significant nature 
 k. significant developments in research and development or relating to intellectual property 
 l. significant legal or regulatory developments, whether positive or negative, actual or threatened, including litigation or resolving litigation 
 m. major events involving a company s securities, including calls of securities for redemption, adoption of stock repurchase programs, option repricings, stock splits, changes in dividend policies, public or private securities offerings, modification to the rights of security holders or notice of delisting 
 n. significant corporate events, such as a pending or proposed merger, joint venture or tender offer, a significant investment, the acquisition or disposition of a significant business or asset or a change in control of a company 
 o. human capital rightsizing exercises or employee lay-offs 
 p. data breaches or other cybersecurity events 

Exhibit 10.21 

q. updates regarding any prior material disclosure that has materially changed 
 r. the existence of any information specifically determined as material by a company and 
 s. the imposition of any Special Blackout Period. 
 For avoidance of doubt, the list above is not exhaustive and there may be other information or events which may be deemed material depending on the situations that may arise. In addition, the above items will not always be material. For example, some contracts or changes in arrangements with service providers may clearly be material while others may not be. 
 Material information is nonpublic if it has not been disseminated in a manner making it available to investors generally. Even if the information is widely known throughout the Company, it may still be nonpublic. To demonstrate that information is public, one must be able to point to some fact that establishes that the information has become publicly available, such as the filing of a report or disclosure with the SEC, the distribution of a press release, publishing the information on our website or posting on social media if those are regular ways we communicate with investors, or by other means that are reasonably designed to provide broad public access. After the release of information, a reasonable period of time must elapse in order to provide the public an opportunity to absorb and evaluate the information provided. As a general rule, and unless as otherwise instructed by the General Counsel, at least two (2) full trading days (as defined below) shall pass after the dissemination of information before being considered public. For clarity, a full trading day means an entire calendar day in which a session of regular trading hours on the NYSE or Nasdaq between 9 30 a.m. and 4 00 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time (or such earlier close time as has been set by exchange rules) has occurred. 
 As a rule of thumb, if you think something might be material nonpublic information, it probably is. You can always reach out to the General Counsel if you have questions. 
 5. Actions Covered by this Policy. 
 Except as discussed in Section E Exceptions to Trading Restrictions ), this Policy applies to all transactions involving the Company s securities or other companies securities for which you possess material nonpublic information obtained in connection with your service with the Company. This Policy therefore applies to 
 a. any purchase, sale, loan or other transfer or disposition of any equity securities (including common stock, options, restricted stock units, warrants and preferred stock) and debt securities (including debentures, bonds and notes) of the Company and such other companies, whether direct or indirect (including transactions made on your behalf by money managers or transactions made through an online trading account platform) 
 b. any other arrangement that generates gains or losses from or based on changes in the prices of such securities including derivative securities (for example, exchange traded put or call options, swaps, caps and collars), hedging and pledging transactions, short sales and certain arrangements regarding participation in benefit plans and 
 c. any offer to engage in the transactions described above. 
 There are no exceptions from insider trading laws or this Policy based on the size of the transaction or the type of consideration received. 
 This Policy also prohibits providing material nonpublic information about a company, including a company s suppliers, customers, competitors or a target company that is potentially subject of an acquisition, joint venture or any other form of business collaboration, to another person who may trade or advise others to trade on the basis of that information, also known as tipping, which is illegal. 
 You are prohibited from providing material nonpublic information about a company to a friend, relative, or anyone else who might buy or sell a security or other financial instrument on the basis of that information, whether or not you intend to or actually do realize a profit (or any other benefit) from such tipping. Additionally, you are prohibited from recommending to any person that such person engage in or refrain from engaging in any transaction involving a company s securities, or otherwise give trading advice concerning a company s securities, if you are in possession of material nonpublic information about a company. 

Exhibit 10.21 

C. ADDITIONAL TRADING RESTRICTIONS FOR RESTRICTED PERSONS 
 1. Blackout Periods 
 Except as discussed in Section E Exceptions to Trading Restrictions ), all of the persons listed below Restricted Persons and each of their Affiliates must refrain from conducting transactions involving the Company s securities during Blackout Periods (as defined below) 
 a. Members of the Board of Directors 
 b. Officers of the Company (including all Vice Presidents of any level, the Corporate Secretary, and any Assistant Corporate Secretaries) 
 c. Group Controllers 
 d. Senior Director, Financial Planning & Analysis (or similar role function) 
 e. Senior Director, Investor Relations (or similar role function) and 
 f. Such other persons as are designated by the General Counsel from time-to-time who are notified that they are Restricted Persons. 
 The General Counsel may update and revise the foregoing list from time to time as deemed appropriate, and will notify such Restricted Persons accordingly. 
 
 2. Blackout Periods Defined. 
 Blackout Periods means each of the following 
 a. Quarterly Blackout Periods . The period beginning fifteen (15) calendar days before the end of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year and ending two (2) business days after financial results for that fiscal quarter or fiscal year have been publicly released (a Quarterly Blackout Period ). 
 b. Special Blackout Periods . The Company always retains the right to impose additional or longer trading blackout periods at any time (a Special Blackout Period and the General Counsel will notify Restricted Persons of a Special Blackout Period by providing a written notice. Special Blackout Periods might also apply to persons other than Restricted Persons or fewer than all Restricted Persons. The General Counsel will notify the impacted Restricted Persons or such other affected persons following the end of a Special Blackout Period. Without limiting the circumstances in which the General Counsel may designate a Special Blackout Period, the General Counsel may designate as a Special Blackout Period the period that begins four business days before and ends four business days after the Company s public announcement of either (A) a new share repurchase plan or program or (B) an increase of an existing share repurchase plan or program. 
 
 3. All trades MUST be pre-cleared. 
 Even if a trade in Company securities is intended to occur outside of a Blackout Period, Restricted Persons must first obtain pre-clearance authorization from the General Counsel before making such trade. To request pre-clearance, you must email the General Counsel with the request, with a copy to the Global Equity and Benefits Advisor, and provide to the General Counsel any documentation as the General Counsel may reasonably require in furtherance of the foregoing procedures. Any failure to provide such information will be grounds for the General Counsel to deny approval of your trade request. There are no unconditional safe harbors for trades made at particular times, and all persons subject to this Policy should exercise good judgment at all times. 
 The General Counsel will advise you on whether pre-clearance has been granted. In connection with your pre-clearance application, you are required to certify that you are not in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company. The General Counsel is under no obligation to approve a transaction submitted for pre-clearance and may determine not to permit the transaction. The General Counsel s pre-clearance will expire 48 hours from the time the pre-clearance has been granted. 

Exhibit 10.21 

If you expect any trade to be completed more than 48 hours after pre-clearance is granted, you are required to obtain another pre-clearance from the General Counsel. Even after pre-clearance, you may not trade the Company s securities if a Blackout Period is imposed, if you become aware of material nonpublic information prior to the trade being executed, or if such clearance has been rescinded by the General Counsel. If the General Counsel is the requester, then the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or one of their delegates must pre-clear or deny any trade. 
 D. STRICTLY PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS STANDING AND LIMIT ORDERS 
 You may not engage in any of the following types of transactions other than as noted below, regardless of whether you (i) have material nonpublic information or not, or (ii) are a Restricted Person or not. 
 1. Short Sales. You may not engage in short sales (meaning the sale of a security that must be borrowed to make delivery) or sell short against the box (meaning the sale of a security with a delayed delivery) if such sales involve the Company s securities. 
 2. Derivative Securities and Hedging Transactions. You may not, directly or indirectly, (a) trade in publicly-traded options, such as puts and calls, and other derivative securities with respect to the Company s securities (other than stock options, restricted stock units and other compensatory awards issued to you by the Company), or (b) purchase financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds), or otherwise engage in transactions, that hedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value of equity securities either (i) granted to you by the Company as part of your compensation, or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by you. 
 3. Pledging Transactions. You may not pledge the Company s securities as collateral for any loan or as part of any other pledging transaction. 
 4. Margin Accounts. You may not hold the Company s securities in a margin account unless you first obtain pre-clearance from the General Counsel. 
 5. Standing and Limit Orders. Beyond the strictly prohibited transactions outlined above, standing and limit orders (except standing and limit orders under an approved Rule 10b5 1 Plan (as defined below)) create heightened risks for insider trading violations as there is no control over the timing of the purchases or sales that result from standing instructions to a broker. As a result, the transaction could be executed when an individual is in possession of material nonpublic information. The Company therefore discourages Insiders placing standing or limit orders on the Company s securities. If an Insider subject to this Policy nonetheless determines that they must use a standing order or limit order (other than under an approved Rule 10b5 1 Plan), the order should be limited to short duration and the Insider using such standing order or limit order is required to cancel such instructions immediately in the event restrictions are imposed on their ability to trade pursuant to a Blackout Period or if they come into possession of material nonpublic information. 
 E. EXCEPTIONS TO TRADING RESTRICTIONS 
 The following are certain limited exceptions to the insider trading restrictions imposed by this Policy 
 1. Stock option exercises where the purchase of stock options is paid in cash and shares continue to be held by the Insider after the exercise is finalized 
 2. Net share withholding of equity awards where shares are withheld by the Company in order to satisfy tax withholding requirements, so long as the election is irrevocable and made in writing at a time when a trading blackout is not in place and you are not in possession of material nonpublic information 
 3. Sell to cover transactions, to the extent approved and implemented by the Company, where shares are withheld by the Company upon vesting of equity awards and sold in order to satisfy tax withholding requirements however, this exception does not apply to any other market sale for the purposes of paying required withholding 
 4. Trades made pursuant to a valid Rule 10b5 1 Plan (as defined below) approved by the Company (see Section F 10b5-1 Trading Plans below) 
 5. Changes in form of ownership (for example, a transfer from your individual ownership to a trust for which you are the trustee, or transfers between brokerage accounts you own) or 

Exhibit 10.21 

6. Bona fide gifts of the Company s securities or transfers by will or by the laws of descent and distribution however, the trading restrictions under this Policy do apply to any subsequent trading of such securities if the donee is a related party of the donor and, further, if you are subject to the pre-clearance requirements of this Policy, then you must pre-clear any of these transactions with the General Counsel. 
 Any other Policy exceptions must be approved by the General Counsel, in consultation with the Company s board of directors or an independent committee of the board of directors. Please be aware that even if a transaction is subject to an exception to this Policy, you will need to separately assess whether the transaction complies with applicable law. 
 
 F. 10B5-1 TRADING PLANS 
 The Company permits its directors, officers and employees to adopt written trading plans (a Rule 10b5-1 Plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 in order to mitigate the risk of trading on material nonpublic information. The following provisions apply to all Rule 10b5-1 Plans. 
 1. To be approved by the Company and qualify for the exception to this Policy, any Rule 10b5 1 Plan must 
 a. comply with all requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and other applicable law 
 b. be established during an open trading window when the person does not have material nonpublic information 
 c. have a minimum term of six (6) months and a maximum term of two (2) years (starting from when trades may first occur in accordance with this Policy) 
 d. be pre-approved by the General Counsel, who may refuse to approve a Rule 10b5-1 Plan or an amendment to a Rule 10b5-1 Plan as the General Counsel deems appropriate including, without limitation, if the General Counsel determines that such plan does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 or if it is not being entered into in good faith and 
 e. be entered into and operated in good faith. To this end, the Company will require individuals adopting the Rule 10b5-1 Plans to furnish a written certification to the Company that, at the time of the adoption or modification of the plan, (i) the person is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or its securities, and (ii) the person is adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1 (the Certification ). Persons adopting Rule 10b5-1 Plans are advised to retain all Certifications for a minimum period of ten (10) years or no shorter than the minimum retention period as prescribed under the prevailing securities laws. 
 2. The first trade under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan may not occur until 30 calendar days after adoption (including a modification) of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan provided, however that for members of the Company s board of directors as well as officers specified under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (collectively, Statutory Insiders ), the first trade under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan may not occur until after the later of (a) two business days following the disclosure of the Company s financial results in a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K for the fiscal quarter in which the Rule 10b5-1 Plan was adopted, amended or modified, and (b) 90 calendar days after the adoption, amendment or modification of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan. 
 3. Unless otherwise approved by the General Counsel in situations where having multiple plans in place at one time is permissible under the provisions of Rule 10b5-1, a director, officer or employee of the Company may have only one Rule 10b5-1 Plan in effect at any time. However, such persons may adopt a new Rule 10b5-1 Plan to replace an existing Rule 10b5-1 Plan before the scheduled termination date of such existing Rule 10b5-1 Plan so long as the new Rule 10b5-1 Plan does not become effective prior to the completion of expiration of transactions under the existing Rule 10b5-1 Plan, in all cases consistent with Rule 10b5-1, and the new Rule 10b5-1 Plan must comply with the requirements of this Policy. During any 12-month period, a director, officer or employee may only enter into one Rule 10b5-1 Plan that is designed to effect the purchase or sale or other transfer of the total amount of the Company s securities covered by the Rule 10b5-1 Plan in a single transaction. 

Exhibit 10.21 

4. The General Counsel must be promptly notified of any modification to, termination of or suspension of trading under any Rule 10b5-1 Plan. Any modification of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan is generally discouraged absent compelling circumstances and requires pre-approval by the General Counsel. A modification may occur only during an open trading window and while you are not aware of material, nonpublic information. If a person terminates a Rule 10b5-1 Plan prior to its stated duration, the person may not trade in the Company s securities until after the later of (a) the completion of the next Quarterly Blackout Period after termination (or, if the plan is terminated during a Quarterly Blackout Period, the end of that period), and (b) 30 calendar days after termination. Within the one year preceding the modification or adoption of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan, a person may not have otherwise modified or adopted a Rule 10b5-1 Plan more than once. 
 G. COMPANY S RIGHT TO DISCLOSE 
 The Company reserves the right to publicly disclose, including indicating in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K (A) the existence and or terms of any Rule 10b5-1 Plan (except price), including any modification and or termination thereof (B) if any officers and directors traded in the relevant securities in the four (4) business days before or after the announcement of the repurchase plan or program and or (C) any other information that the Company is required to publicly disclose under the U.S. federal securities laws and other applicable law. 
 
 H. SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE 
 Statutory Insiders are required to comply with the transaction reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act and related rules and regulations. To ensure transactions subject to Section 16 requirements are reported on time, each person subject to these requirements must provide (or ensure their broker provides) the General Counsel and the Global Equity and Benefits Advisor with detailed information (for example, trade date, number of shares, exact prices, weighted average price, etc. about his or her transactions involving the Company s securities, including dispositions of securities by bona fide gifts. Compliance by directors and executive officers with this provision is imperative given the requirement of Section 16 of the Exchange Act that these persons generally report changes in ownership of Company securities within two (2) business days. 
 The sanctions for noncompliance with this reporting deadline include mandatory disclosure in the Company s proxy statement for the next annual meeting of stockholders, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions for chronic or egregious violators. The Company is available to assist in filing Section 16 reports, but the obligation to comply with Section 16 is personal. If you have any questions, you should check with the General Counsel. 
 
 I. YOUR PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
 Please consult with your personal legal and financial advisors as needed. Note that the Company s legal counsel, both internal and external, represent the Company and not you personally. There may be instances where you suffer financial harm or other hardship or are otherwise required to forego a planned transaction because of the restrictions imposed by this Policy or under securities laws. If you were aware of the material nonpublic information at the time of the trade, it is not a defense that you did not use the information for the trade. Personal financial emergency or other personal circumstances are not mitigating factors under securities laws and will not excuse your failure to comply with this Policy. 
 
 J. VIOLATIONS OF THIS POLICY 
 Insiders who violate this Policy will be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, up to and including the possibility of termination of employment or an ongoing relationship with the Company. The Company has full and final discretion to determine whether this Policy has been violated based on the information available. It is not necessary for the Company to await the filing or conclusion of a civil or criminal action against the alleged violator before taking disciplinary action. 

Exhibit 10.21 

There are also serious legal consequences for individuals who violate insider trading laws, including large criminal and civil fines, significant imprisonment terms and disgorgement of any profits gained or losses avoided. The SEC, and the U.S. securities exchanges, through the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), investigate and are very effective at detecting insider trading. The U.S. government pursues insider trading violations vigorously, successfully prosecuting, for example, cases against trading by employees in foreign accounts, trading by family members and friends, and trading involving only a small number of shares. 
 The penalties for violating rules against insider trading can be severe and include 
 a. forfeiting any profit gained or loss avoided by the trading 
 b. payment of the loss suffered by the persons who, contemporaneously with the purchase or sale of securities that are subject of a violation, have purchased or sold securities of the same class 
 c. payment of criminal penalties of up to US 5 million 
 d. payment of civil penalties of up to three times the profit made or loss avoided and 
 e. imprisonment for up to 20 years and 
 f. a bar on serving as an officer or director of a public company. 
 The Company and or the supervisors of the person engaged in insider trading may also be required to pay civil penalties or fines of US 2 million or more, up to three times the profit made or loss avoided, as well as criminal penalties of up to US 25 million, and could under some circumstances be subject to private lawsuits. 
 You may also be liable for improper securities trading by any person (commonly referred to as a tippee to whom you have disclosed material nonpublic information that you have learned through your position at the Company or made recommendations or expressed opinions about securities trading on the basis of such information. If you disclose material nonpublic information to a tippee, you can be subject to the same penalties and sanctions as the tippee even if you did not profit from a transaction. 
 
 K. REPORTING 
 If you believe someone is violating this Policy, you should report it to the General Counsel. Please refer to the Company s Whistleblower Policy for the relevant reporting procedures. 
 
 L. AMENDMENTS 
 The Company reserves the right to amend this Policy at any time, for any reason, subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, and with or without notice, although it will attempt to provide notice in advance of any change. 
 
 M. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
 The Company will deliver a copy of this Policy to all current directors, officers, employees and contractors and to future directors, officers, employees and contractors at the start of their employment or relationship with the Company. Each of these individuals must acknowledge (in the form of EXHIBIT A to this Policy) that they have received a copy of this Policy and agree to comply with the terms of this Policy. 
 At the Company s request, Restricted Persons may be required to re-acknowledge and agree to comply with the Policy (including any amendments or modifications) from time-to-time.
