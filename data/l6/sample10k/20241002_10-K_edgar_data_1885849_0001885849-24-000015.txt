DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

In General 

Tofla Megaline Inc. Tofla 
or we or "the Company") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 31, 2018. Tofla has only one officer
and director who is Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo. As a development stage company specializing in software for robotic devices, we provide cutting-edge
AI solutions that enhance security and efficiency. Our focus is on developing easy-to-use, high-quality, and cost-effective automation
solutions for both standalone and integrated applications. Our key feature is developing software for security purposes. We offer a comprehensive
suite of software products designed to improve the capabilities of robotic units in surveillance, patrol, and navigation. Our solutions
include advanced algorithms for real-time threat detection, intelligent software for precise route planning and management, and predictive
maintenance capabilities to minimize downtime and reduce costs. Beyond our software offerings, we also provide comprehensive consulting
and technical support services. 

Our solutions can be integrated
with established control equipment and security systems, or used as independent versions. Our current projects involve software integration
with security and video surveillance systems, along with the development of customizable solutions that support long-distance navigation,
and task completion. 

Our technology integrates
a modular system of specialized devices for data collection, advanced AI for real-time threat analysis, and sophisticated software for
seamless integration and control. The modular system offers flexibility and scalability, allowing for easy updates, troubleshooting, and
customization to meet diverse security requirements. AI processes collected data in real-time, detecting potential threats and initiating
appropriate responses. Our software coordinates the various components, ensuring smooth communication and operation between the modular
devices, AI algorithms, and other system elements. 

By harnessing the power of
our modular system, AI capabilities, and innovative software, we are redefining the future of security technology and delivering unparalleled
protection to our clients. 

Principal Products and Services 

Tofla s primary business
includes developing AI-powered software for robotic security systems. We offer a range of software products designed to enhance the
capabilities of these robotic units, including: 

- Threat Detection Software: This software utilizes advanced algorithms
to analyze video footage in real time, identifying potential security threats such as unauthorized access, suspicious activities, and
other violations. 

- Route Optimization Software: Designed to optimize patrol routes
for robotic units, ensuring efficient coverage of designated areas and minimizing redundant movements. 

- Predictive Maintenance Software: This software leverages AI
to predict potential maintenance issues based on usage patterns and sensor data, allowing for proactive interventions and minimizing
downtime. 

- Integration Software: Our solutions can be seamlessly integrated
with existing security systems and control equipment, providing a unified and comprehensive security solution. 

4 

These software products collectively
enable robotic security systems to perform their duties more effectively, efficiently, and proactively, enhancing overall security
and reducing the burden on human personnel. 

Our Company is at the forefront
of robotic security software development, leveraging years of investment in AI, autonomy, and efficiency. We offer a comprehensive
suite of solutions designed to enhance the capabilities of robotic units in surveillance, patrol, and threat detection. Our
software is tailored to meet the specific needs of both individual users and businesses seeking to improve their security posture. We
are committed to providing personalized support and ensuring the highest standards of performance and reliability. 

Marketing Plans 

To enhance our market presence and drive growth, we
will implement a comprehensive marketing strategy encompassing digital marketing, partnerships, and customer relationship management. Our
digital marketing efforts will focus on SEO, PPC advertising, and email marketing to increase online visibility and generate leads. 
To foster customer loyalty and provide exceptional service, we will implement a robust CRM system and prioritize customer satisfaction. By
effectively executing these marketing strategies, we aim to position our Company as a leading player in the security software market and
achieve our business goals. 

Competition 

The software development market is highly competitive, with
a large number of companies operating in the space. Entry barriers are relatively low, leading to intense competition. To
differentiate ourselves, we will focus on providing tailored solutions that address the specific needs of each client. 

We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend
to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may
not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs, a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease
operations.

respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense was due to professional services received in the current period to develop
the software for sale with no similar cost incurred in the prior period. The increase in server rental expenses was due to server price
increases at the internet service provider and the increase in amortization expense was due to the acquisition of intangible assets over
time.

2024, and 2023 was (24,540) and 649, respectively, due to the reasons explained above.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates 

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition 

 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The core principle of
ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity recognizes revenue in
accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer. Step 2: Identify
the performance obligations in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4. Allocate the transaction price. Step 5:
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

8 

The Company generates revenue through the sale of
software and by providing consulting or technical support services. For the sale of software, revenue is recognized at the point in time
when the ownership of software (as approved by the customer) is transferred per the terms of a contract. The Company shall not be liable
for any failure to perform its obligations if such failure is due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control. Any liability of the
Company shall be limited to the total of all amounts paid by the customer for services under the contract. For consulting or technical
support services, revenue is recognized as the services are provided. 

The Company generally collects payment from customers
prior to transferring ownership of software or at the end of any service period and may require deposits from customers at the time an
order is placed. When deposits are collected prior to transferring ownership of software or before services are performed the Company
recognizes deferred revenue until the transfer is made or services are provided. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has reviewed all the recent accounting
pronouncements issued to date of the issuance of these financial statements, and does not believe any of these pronouncements will have
a material impact on the Company s financial reporting. 

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including
arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

Board of Directors and Shareholders 

 Tofla Megaline Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tofla Megaline
Inc. as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for
the years then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tofla Megaline Inc. as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the entity will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the entity has reported losses,
limited revenues, an accumulated deficit and expects losses in the development of its business, all of which raise substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent
with respect to Tofla Megaline Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Tofla Megaline Inc. is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

11 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period
audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

We have served as Tofla

TOFLA MEGALINE INC. 

 NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 JULY 31, 2024 

for the year ended July 31, 2024. The Company has limited revenues and an accumulated deficit of 
as of July 31, 2024 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary
financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management expects
revenue growth to continue over the next twelve months. In the event that revenue is not available to cover all expenses, the Company
intends to finance operating costs with loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock. 

These tiers include: 

Level 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets; 

Level 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices
in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 

Level 3: defined as unobservable inputs in which
little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 

The carrying value of cash and the Company's loan
from shareholder approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity. 

The Company continually monitors events and changes
in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances
are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will
be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of
those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation, our Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that in light of the material weaknesses described below, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of July 31, 2024. See material weaknesses discussed below in Management s Annual Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024, using the criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO - 2013"). 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies
that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1.We lack an adequate internal control structure 
Due to the size of the Company we do not have the appropriate control activities, risk assessment procedures, controls over information
and communication, or effective monitoring controls. 

2.We do not have appropriate segregation of duties
or adequate accounting resources The Company has only one employee that does not have sufficient accounting knowledge, experience,
and understanding of US GAAP or SEC rules, therefore no expertise or reviews are in place to ensure adequate financial reporting. Further,
while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial
expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statements. Currently the Board of Directors
acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide
the necessary oversight over management s activities. 

23 

3.We do not have appropriate information technology
controls The Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence
of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated
factors. Further there are no IT controls in place to prevent changes to, or misstatement in, financial reporting. 

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control
deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

As a result of the material weaknesses described above,
management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024 based
on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including
its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change in our internal control over
financial reporting occurred during the year ended July 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

follows: 

Name 
 Age 
 Positions 
 
 Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo 
 53 
 President, Treasurer, Secretary and Director (Principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer) 

Set forth below is a brief description of the background
and business experience of our executive officers and directors for the past five years. 

24 

Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo 

Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo has acted as our President,
Treasurer, Secretary and sole Director since we incorporated on August 31, 2018. Mr. Angulo owns 100 of the outstanding shares of our
common stock. As such, it was unilaterally decided that Mr. Angulo was going to be our sole President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer,
and Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Secretary and member of our board of directors. Between 2011 and 2018, Mr. Angulo
worked as IT project manager in real estate sector for Afkal Develop (Leon, Mexico). Mr. Angulo s responsibilities included managing
the Company s projects and he was responsible for programming and extensions for project teams. In 2006, Mr. Angulo decided to change
his field of work and started working as a freelance IT manager for a small firm in Leon, Mexico, where he worked until 2011. Between
1996 and 2005, Mr. Angulo worked in the area of car dealership called Leonveh ltd. in Leon, Mexico. Mr. Angulo studied at University of
Leon in Leon, Mexico from 1989 to 1995 and he did not graduate. Mr. Angulo prioritized experience in business over education. This enabled
him to obtain more experience sooner and start new business with additional knowledge. 

 During the past ten years, Mr. Angulo has not
been the subject to any of the following events: 

 1. Any bankruptcy petition filed by or against
any business of which Mr. Angulo was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior
to that time. 

 2. Any conviction in a criminal proceeding or
being subject to a pending criminal proceeding. 

 3. An order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently
reversed, suspended or vacated, or any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise
limiting Mr. Angulo s involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities. 

 4. Found by a court of competent jurisdiction
(in a civil action), the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Future Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state
securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated. 

 5. Was the subject of any order, judgment or
decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any Federal or State authority barring, suspending or otherwise limiting for
more than 60 days the right to engage in any activity described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, or to be associated with persons
engaged in any such activity; 

6. Was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or
by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission
has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated; 

 7. Was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal
or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to
an alleged violation of: 

 i. Any Federal or State securities or commodities
law or regulation; or 

 ii. Any law or regulation respecting financial
institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution,
civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order; or 

 iii. Any law or regulation prohibiting mail
or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or 

25 

8. Was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction
or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))),
or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated
with a member. 

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Our Board of Directors is currently composed of one
member, Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo, who does not qualify as an independent director. Our board of directors has not made a subjective determination
as to each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of
independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Had our Board of Directors made these determinations, our board
of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director s business
and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. 

INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

No director, executive officer, significant employee
or control person of the Company has been involved in any legal proceeding listed in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past 10 years. 

AUDIT COMMITTEE, COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, AND FINANCIAL
EXPERT 

We do not have an Audit Committee or Compensation
Committee because the Company s sole employee is also the sole member of management and sole director. Additionally, we have no
persons currently receiving any compensation due to our start-up nature. Our sole director performs some of the same functions of an Audit
Committee and Compensation Committee, such as: recommending a firm of independent certified public accountants to audit the annual financial
statements; reviewing the independent auditor s independence, the financial statements, and their audit report; reviewing management s
administration of the system of internal accounting controls, and determining all compensation amounts. The Company does not currently
have a written audit committee charter or a compensation committee charter or any similar documents. 

We have no financial expert. We believe the cost related
to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further, because of our start-up operations, we believe the services of a
financial expert are not warranted. 

CODE OF ETHICS 

The Company has not adopted a formal written code
of ethics due to the small size of the organization and start-up nature, along with the fact that the Company s sole employee is
also the sole member of management and sole director.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. 

The following table lists, as of the date of this
form 10-K, the number of shares of common stock of our Company that are beneficially owned by (i) each person or entity known to our Company
to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of the outstanding common stock; (ii) each officer and director of our Company; and (iii) all
officers and directors as a group. Information relating to beneficial ownership of common stock by our principal shareholders and management
is based upon information furnished by each person using "beneficial ownership" concepts under the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting
power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security, or investment power, which includes the power to vote or
direct the voting of the security. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right
to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. 

Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules,
more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner
of securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest. Except as noted below, each person has sole voting
and investment power. 

The percentages below are calculated based on 5,352,035
shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this Form 10-K. We do not have any outstanding warrant, options or
other securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director
Independence. 

Effective August 31, 2018 the Company s CEO
and sole director formally agreed to advance funds to the Company to pay for professional fees and operating expenses under a 50,000
Loan Agreement. Effective April 20, 2022 the Company s CEO and sole director formally agreed to advance additional funds to the
Company to pay for professional fees and operating expenses under a second 50,000 Loan Agreement. Effective June 12, 2024 the Company
entered into an amended and restated loan agreement with its CEO and sole director that consolidated all earlier loans and increased the
loan amount by an additional 50,000. The outstanding loan agreement is non-binding and discretionary, bears no interest, is unsecured,
and has no fixed due date, therefore, any amounts outstanding under the agreement is considered due on demand. The Company s CEO
and sole director was due 124,701 as of July 31, 2024 under the amended and restated loan agreement, where during the year ended July
31, 2024 142,216 was advanced to the Company and the Company made repayments of 65,350.
