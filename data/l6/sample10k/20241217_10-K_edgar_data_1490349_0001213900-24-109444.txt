Item 1. Business 

GENERAL 

PhenixFIN Corporation PhenixFIN ,
the Company, we and us is an internally-managed non-diversified closed-end management investment
company incorporated in Delaware that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). We completed our initial public offering IPO and commenced
operations on January 20, 2011. The Company has elected, and intends to qualify annually, to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
Through December 31, 2020, we were an externally managed company. Since January 1, 2021, we have operated under our present internalized
management structure. 

The Company has formed and expects to continue
to form certain taxable subsidiaries (the Taxable Subsidiaries ), which are taxed as corporations for federal income tax
purposes. These Taxable Subsidiaries allow us to, among other things, hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through
entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a RIC under the Code. 

The Company s investment objective is to
generate current income and capital appreciation. The management team seeks to achieve this objective primarily through making loans,
private equity investments in privately-held companies. The Company may also make debt, equity or other investments in publicly-traded
companies. (These investments may also include investments in other BDCs, closed-end funds or real estate investment trusts REITs ).)
We also pursue other strategic opportunities and invest in other assets or operate other businesses to achieve our investment objective,
such as operating and managing an asset-based lending business. The portfolio generally consists of senior secured first lien term loans,
senior secured second lien term loans, senior secured bonds, preferred equity and common equity. Occasionally, we will receive warrants
or other equity participation features which we believe will have the potential to increase total investment returns. Our loan and other
debt investments are primarily rated below investment grade or are unrated. Investments in below investment grade securities are considered
predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal when due. 

We believe there are attractive opportunities
in the private debt market for non-bank investors like the Company. We lend directly to many companies that are underserved by the traditional
banking system and generally seek to avoid broadly marketed investment opportunities. We also believe there are attractive private equity
investment opportunities. We source investment opportunities primarily through direct relationships with financial sponsors and other
market participants, industry specialists, as well as financial intermediaries such as investment banks and commercial banks. 

Our Investment Team is responsible for sourcing
investment opportunities, conducting industry research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments and
monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. Our Investment Team draws on its expertise in lending to and investing in predominantly
privately held companies in a range of sectors, including industrials, transportation, energy and natural resources, financials, gemstones/jewelry,
insurance and real estate. 

On October 1, 2024, the Company consummated the acquisition of approximately
80 of the equity of The National Security Group, an Alabama based insurance holding company NSG ). NSG is a nationwide
underwriter of life, accident, and health insurance. In addition, NSG is a specialty underwriter of property and casualty insurance throughout
the southeast, other than Florida and Louisiana. The Company has entered into a contract with NSG to manage a portion of its investment
assets. 

As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory
requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through
borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act,
equals at least 200 (or 150 if certain requirements under the 1940 Act are met) after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we
employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. 

1 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company s
asset coverage was 216.8 after giving effect to leverage and therefore the Company s asset coverage was greater than 200 , the
minimum asset coverage requirement applicable presently to the Company under the 1940 Act. 

Our principal executive office is located at 445
Park Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, NY and our telephone number is (212) 859-0390. 

Investment Process Overview 

Sourcing and Origination . We typically
source investment opportunities through our management team s network of long-standing relationships. Our sourcing efforts are led
by our senior investment professionals, who leverage their experience in the sourcing and origination of investments. 

Initial Evaluation . We use a systematic,
consistent approach to credit evaluation, which typically consists of (i) a preliminary due diligence review conducted by the Company,
(ii) an initial diligence meeting with the portfolio company s management team, investment bank or private equity sponsor, (iii)
an initial indication of interest and terms, and (iv) preparation of memoranda including potential portfolio company overviews, investment
considerations and risks, financial model and return information. 

Due Diligence Underwriting . We typically
undertake continued diligence, which expands on the investment thesis, risks and mitigants, and competition factors of our potential investment
opportunities. We may conduct third party reviews, on-site visits and/or background checks in connection with our potential investments
in portfolio companies. 

Portfolio Management . We undertake a proactive
monitoring process of our portfolio companies, whereby we conduct monthly financial review and monitoring of compliance with covenants,
maintain ongoing dialogue with portfolio company management and owners, and exercise board observer rights where appropriate. 

Rating Criteria. We generally use an investment
rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and our expected level of returns on each debt investment in our portfolio.
We use a five-level numeric rating scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 

Credit Rating 
 
 Definition 

1 
 
 Investments that are performing above expectations. 

2 
 
 Investments that are performing within expectations, with risks that are neutral or favorable compared to risks at the time of origination. All new loans are rated 2 . 

3 
 
 Investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of interest, dividend or principal is expected. Companies rated 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants, however, loan payments are generally not past due. 

4 
 
 Investments that are performing below expectations and for which risk has increased materially since origination. Some loss of interest or dividend is expected but no loss of principal. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). 

5 
 
 Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Some loss of principal is expected. 

2 

Investment Structure 

Once we have determined that a prospective portfolio
company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that portfolio company and its other capital providers to structure
an investment. We negotiate among these parties to agree on how our investment is expected to perform relative to the other capital in
the portfolio company s capital structure. 

We typically structure our debt investments as follows: 

Senior Secured First Lien Term Loans We
structure these investments as senior secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio companies that serve
as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral generally takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets
of the portfolio company borrower. Our senior secured loans may provide for amortization of principal with the majority of the amortization
due at maturity. 

Senior Secured Second Lien Term Loans We
structure these investments as junior, secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies that serve
as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral generally takes the form of second-priority liens on the assets
of a portfolio company. These loans typically provide for amortization of principal in the initial years of the loans, with the majority
of the amortization due at maturity. 

Senior Secured First Lien Notes We structure
these investments as senior secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies that serve as collateral
in support of the repayment of such notes. This collateral generally takes the form of priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company.
These notes typically have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and payment-in-kind, or PIK ),
interest), with amortization of principal due at maturity. PIK interest represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance
that is generally due at the end of the loan term and recorded as interest income on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected
to be collected. 

Warrants and Minority Equity Securities In
some cases, we may also receive nominally priced warrants or options to buy a minority equity interest in the portfolio company in connection
with a debt investment. As a result, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this
equity interest. We may structure such warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as
a put, or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may
also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and piggyback 
registration rights. 

Unitranche Loans We structure our unitranche
loans, which combine the characteristics of traditional senior secured first lien term loans and subordinated notes as senior secured
loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of
these loans. This collateral generally takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. Unitranche loans typically
provide for amortization of principal in the initial years of the loans, with the majority of the amortization due at maturity. 

Unsecured Debt We structure these investments
as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates that provide us with significant current interest
income. These loans typically have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest),
with amortization of principal due at maturity. Subordinated notes generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal
at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at
maturity. The valuation of subordinated notes are generally more volatile than secured loans and may involve a greater risk of loss of
principal. Subordinated notes often include a PIK feature, which effectively operates as negative amortization of loan principal. 

We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity
or repayment, but we may realize or sell some of our investments earlier if a liquidity event occurs, such as a sale or recapitalization
transaction, or the worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company. 

3 

The Company has invested in its affiliate, FlexFIN,
LLC FlexFIN ), which operates an asset-based lending business under which it enters into secured loans and secured financing
structures with borrowers engaged in the gemstone/jewelry industry. FlexFIN will generally structure these loans as sale/repurchase transactions
under which the collateral (that is, the gemstones/jewelry) remains under FlexFIN s ownership during the entire term of the loan. 

Managerial Assistance 

As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request,
managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations
of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies
and providing other organizational and financial guidance. We may receive fees for these services. 

Leverage 

As a BDC, we are generally only allowed to employ
leverage to the extent that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200 after giving effect to such leverage.
The amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed
borrowing. We are also subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to our borrowings. For a discussion of such requirements, see
 Regulation - Senior Securities. 

We may, from time to time, seek to retire or repurchase
our common stock through cash purchases, as well as retire, cancel or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges,
in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing
market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be
material. 

Competition 

Our primary competitors to provide financing to
private companies are public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies, other BDCs, Small Business
Investment Companies SBICs and private equity and hedge funds. Some competitors may have access to funding sources that
are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could
allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are
not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must
satisfy to maintain our favorable RIC tax treatment. 

Human Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, the internalized management
team consists of 3 investment professionals and 6 employees/consultants overall. This team includes our executive officers, investment
and finance professionals, and administrative staff. Our senior management team consists of David Lorber, our chief executive officer,
and Ellida McMillan, our chief financial officer. 

As an internally managed BDC, the success of our
business and investment strategy, including achieving our investment objective, depends in material part on our professional team. We
depend upon the members of our management team and our investment professionals for the identification, final selection, structuring,
closing and monitoring of our investments. Our professional team has critical experience and relationships on which we rely to implement
our business plan. We expect that the members of our management team and our investment professionals will maintain key informal relationships,
which we will use to help identify and gain access to investment opportunities. If we do not attract, develop and retain highly talented
professionals, we may not be able to operate our business as we expect and our operating results could be adversely affected. See Item
1A. Risk Factors.

Administration 

Since January 1, 2021, we have operated pursuant
to an internalized management structure. To lead the internalized management team, the Board approved the appointment of David Lorber,
who had served as an independent director of the Company since April 2019, as Chief Executive Officer, and Ellida McMillan as Chief Financial
Officer of the Company, each effective January 1, 2021. 

In connection with the adoption by the board of
directors of an internalized management structure, on November 19, 2020, the Company entered into a Fund Accounting Servicing Agreement
and an Administration Servicing Agreement on customary terms with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC d/b/a U.S. Bank Global Fund Services U.S. Bancorp ). A U.S. Bancorp affiliate also served as the Company s custodian. The Company s administrative
and custodial relationship with U.S. Bancorp terminated on August 9, 2022. SS C Technologies, Inc. SS C has since
served as administrator of the Company and has provided us with fund accounting and financial reporting services pursuant to its Services
Agreement with the Company. Effective September 12, 2022, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. Computershare serves as custodian
for the Company pursuant to its Loan Administration and Custodial Agreement with the Company.

Summary of Risk Factors 

Investing in our securities involves a high degree
of risk. You should carefully consider the information in Item 1A. Risk Factors , including, but not limited to, the following
risks: 

Certain Risks in the Current Environment 

We are operating in a period of market disruption and economic uncertainty, which may adversely affect the yields, and increase the risks of, our investment, and make it more difficult for us to raise equity capital. 

Events outside of our control could negatively affect our portfolio companies and make their valuation uncertain, increase our funding costs and limit access to capital. 

Rising interest rates may increase borrowing costs, reduce the net return on debt investments, and increase the risk of default on our portfolio company loans. Other events could negatively impact our cost of borrowing and the net return on our investments. 

Risks Related to our Business 

We operate under an internalized operating structure and may incur significant costs and face significant risks associated with being self-managed. 

Because we use borrowed funds, we are exposed to risks typically associated with leverage, potentially magnifying the risk of investing in us. Lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. 

5 

A substantial portion of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined by our valuation designee, and there may be uncertainty regarding the value of our portfolio investments. Also, we are not limited with respect to the proportion of our assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer. 

We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates on
loans under our credit facility and loans to our portfolio companies, which bear interest based on SOFR or LIBOR. Changes in interest
rates also affect our cost of capital and net investment income. 

Our investments may not be managed effectively. We may change our investment objective and strategies. Our operating results may fluctuate. Failure to remain a BDC could reduce our operating flexibility. 

We may be unable to pay distributions to shareholders, particularly if we realize income without receiving cash. 

Failures of our information, cybersecurity and disaster recovery systems could disrupt our business. 

Risks Related to our Investments 

We may not realize gains from our equity investments, which may be risky and highly speculative. We may be unable to make follow-on investments in portfolio companies, which could impair their value. 

If portfolio companies prepay loans, our yields will be reduced if we cannot invest at an equal or higher rate. 

We invest in securities of
 foreign companies, which may involve significant risks. 

Our investment in a lender to the jewelry business, which comprises 12.1 of our assets, is subject to volatility in prices of gemstones/jewelry and the risk of fraud and counterfeiting. 

We may invest in
 unitranche and covenant-lite debt instruments, which have higher yields but entail greater risk. We may
 also be subject to the risks associated with investments in distressed issuers, hedging transactions and sector
 concentration. The disposition of our investments may result in contingent liabilities. 

Risks Related to our Operations as a BDC and a RIC 

Regulations governing our operation as a BDC may limit our ability to raise additional capital. 

We depend upon our
 management and investment teams and would be significantly affected by their loss. As an internally managed BDC, we may be
 restricted by the compensation to them that we may offer. 

Future tax reform legislation relating to BDC s may adversely affect our investments and our business. 

If a sufficient portion of our assets are not qualifying assets, we could fail to qualify as a BDC. We would be subject to corporate-level income tax if we did not qualify as a RIC or satisfy RIC distribution requirements. 

6 

Risks Relating to an Investment in our Securities 

Investing in our securities may involve above average risk, and the market price of our shares fluctuates. Our shares have not traded at or above NAV since the first quarter of 2015. NAV per share may be diluted if we sell shares or convertible securities below NAV per share. 

Provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents could deter a takeover, depressing our share price. 

Our issuance of preferred stock could affect the volatility of our NAV
and market value, and may give preferred stock holders rights adverse to common stock holders. Our credit facility places restrictions
on our activities. 

We could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities class actions and derivative lawsuits. 

Risks Related to the Life Insurance and Annuities
Business of NSG 

A ssumptions regarding policyholder behavior may be incorrect, requiring NSG
to increase its reserves. 

Data underlying morbidity and mortality on which NSG relies may be insufficient,
incorrect or incomplete, and public health crises may adversely impact NSG s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risks Related to the Property Casualty Insurance Business
of NSG 

Models used by NSG to evaluate risk are subject to uncertainty, and losses may differ materially from
estimates. 

NSG s expense reserves may be inadequate to cover losses. 

NSG is subject to unexpected changes in the interpretation of the coverage provisions of its policies. 

NSG s failure to accurately and timely pay claims could materially and adversely affect its business. 

The property and casualty insurance business is historically cyclical in nature. 

Risks Related to the Insurance Business Generally 

NSG relies on insurance retail agents and brokers, and its business is subject to intense competition. 

Insurance companies are subject to extensive regulation, and failure to satisfy regulatory requirements
could subject NSG to operational restrictions or other sanctions. 

NSG may be unable to purchase reinsurance in amounts desired on acceptable terms, and reinsurers may
default or fail to perform. Climate change could have a material adverse effect on NSG s business. 

Performance of NSG s investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks, including
conditions in the capital markets and the U.S. economy generally. 

NSG will be required to increase its reserves if they are inadequate, adversely affecting its liquidity. 

Employees of NSG or its third-party service providers may take excessive risks resulting in losses. 

INVESTMENTS 

We have built a diverse portfolio that includes
senior secured first lien term loans, senior secured second lien term loans, equity, unitranche loans, senior secured first lien notes,
subordinated notes, warrants and minority equity securities by investing approximately 10 million to 50 million of capital, on average,
in the securities of portfolio companies.

 All interest is payable in cash and/or PIK, and all SOFR or LIBOR represents 1 Month, 3 Month or 6 Month respective rates unless otherwise indicated. For each debt investment, we have provided the current spread over index interest rate as of September 30, 2024. 

10 

As of September 30, 2024, our income-bearing
investment portfolio, which represented 84.5 of our total portfolio, had a weighted average yield based upon cost of our portfolio investments
of approximately 12.3 and 57.9 of our income-bearing investment portfolio bore interest based on floating rates, such SOFR or LIBOR,
17.0 of our income-bearing investment portfolio bore interest at fixed rates, and 25.1 of our income-bearing investment portfolio are
income-producing equity investments. As of September 30, 2023, our income-bearing investment portfolio, which represented 88.2 of our
total portfolio, had a weighted average yield based upon cost of our portfolio investments of approximately 13.3 and 59.5 of our income-bearing
investment portfolio bore interest based on floating rates, such LIBOR or SOFR, 13.9 of our income-bearing investment portfolio bore
interest at fixed rates, and 26.6 of our income-bearing investment portfolio are income-producing equity investments. The weighted average
yield of our total portfolio does not represent the total return to our stockholders. The weighted average yield on income producing
investments is computed based upon a combination of the cash flows to date and the contractual interest payments, principal amortization
and fee notes due at maturity without giving effect to closing fees received, base management fees, incentive fees or general fund related
expenses. For each floating rate loan, the projected fixed-rate equivalent coupon rate used to forecast the interest cash flows was calculated
by adding the interest rate spread specified in the relevant loan document to the fixed-rate equivalent floating rate, duration-matched
to the specific loan, adjusted by the floating rate floor and/or cap in place on that loan.

Administration Agreement 

In connection with the adoption by the board of
directors of an internalized management structure, on November 19, 2020, the Company entered into a Fund Accounting Servicing Agreement
and an Administration Servicing Agreement on customary terms with U.S. Bancorp. A U.S. Bancorp affiliate also served as the Company s
custodian. The Company s administrative and custodial relationship with U.S. Bancorp terminated on August 9, 2022. SS C has
since served as administrator of the Company and has provided us with fund accounting and financial reporting services pursuant to its
Services Agreement with the Company. Effective September 12, 2022, Computershare serves as custodian for the Company pursuant to its Loan
Administration and Custodial Agreement with the Company. For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred 0.3 million,
 0.3 million and 0.3 million in administrator expenses, respectively. 

Internalized Management Structure 

On November 18, 2020, the board of directors approved
adoption of an internalized management structure effective January 1, 2021. 

To lead the internalized management team, the
board appointed David Lorber, who had served as an independent director of the Company since April 2019, as Chief Executive Officer and
Ellida McMillan, who previously served as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of Alcentra Capital Corporation, a NASDAQ-traded
BDC, from April 2017 until it merged into Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. in February 2020, as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, each
effective January 1, 2021. Mr. Lorber is paid an annual base salary of 530,000, and Ms. McMillan is paid an annual base salary of 350,000,
and each is eligible for one or more discretionary cash bonuses. 

15 

The internalized management team is responsible
for the day-to-day management and operations of the Company, under the oversight of the board. The internalized management team presently
consists of 3 investment professionals and 6 employees/consultants overall. The Company retained ACA Group, the successor to Alaric Compliance
Services, LLC, whose officer serves as the Company s Chief Compliance Officer. As discussed above, the Company has also entered
into a services agreement on customary terms with SS C, which serves as the Company s administrator, as well as a loan administration
and custodial agreement on customary terms with Computershare, who serves as our primary custodian. 

REGULATION 

General 

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under
the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal
underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than interested
persons , as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business
so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

As a BDC, we are required to meet an asset coverage
ratio, reflecting the value of our total assets to our total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred
stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200 . However, in March 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the SBCA modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from 200 to 150 , if certain requirements
are met. Under the 1940 Act, we are allowed to increase our leverage capacity if stockholders representing at least a majority of the
votes cast, when a quorum is present, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive stockholder approval, we would be allowed to increase
our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, the 1940 Act allows the majority of our independent directors
to approve an increase in our leverage capacity, and such approval would become effective on the one-year anniversary of such approval.
In either case, we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the
receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage. The Company has not sought
stockholder or independent director approval to reduce its asset coverage ratio to 150 . 

On March 23, 2018, the SBCA was signed into law
and, among other things, instructs the SEC to issue rules or amendments to rules allowing BDCs to use the same registration, offering
and communication processes that are available to operating companies. The rules and amendments specified by the SBCA became self-implementing
on March 24, 2019. On April 8, 2020, the SEC adopted rules and amendments to implement certain provisions of the SBCA (the Final
Rules that, among other things, modify the registration, offering, and communication processes available to BDCs relating to:
(i) the shelf offering process to permit the use of short-form registration statements on Form N-2 and incorporation by reference; (ii)
the ability to qualify for well-known seasoned issuer status; (iii) the immediate or automatic effectiveness of certain filings made in
connection with continuous public offerings; and (iv) communication processes and prospectus delivery. In addition, the SEC adopted rules
that will require BDCs to comply with certain structured data and inline XBRL requirements. The Final Rules generally became effective
on August 1, 2020, except that a BDC eligible to file short-form registration statements on Form N-2, like the Company, must comply with
the Inline XBRL structured data requirements for its financial statements, registration statement cover page, and certain prospectus information
by August 1, 2022. 

We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from
knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested
persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. 

Qualifying Assets 

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any
asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the
time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70 of the company s total assets. The principal categories of
qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 

(1) 
 Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: 

is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 

16 

is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the Company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 

satisfies any of the following: 

has a market capitalization of less than 250 million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; 

is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result thereof, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or 

is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than 4 million and capital and surplus of not less than 2 million. 

(2) 
 Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60 of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 

(3) 
 Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 

(4) 
 Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. 

(5) 
 Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 

(6) 
 Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 

The regulations defining and interpreting qualifying
assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative,
administrative or judicial actions in this area. 

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 

A BDC must have been organized and have its principal
place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described
in Regulation Qualifying Assets above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for
the purpose of the 70 requirement, the BDC generally must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available
to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance. Where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or
more other persons acting together, the BDC will satisfy this test if one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial
assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors,
officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management,
operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 

17 

Temporary Investments 

Pending investment in other types of qualifying
assets , as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt
securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that
70 of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in highly rated commercial paper, U.S. Government agency notes, U.S.
Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements relating to such securities that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the
U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and
the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase
price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that
may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, certain diversification tests that must be met in order to qualify as a RIC for
U.S. federal income tax purposes will typically require us to limit the amount we invest with any one counterparty. We will monitor the
creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

Senior Securities 

We are permitted, under specified conditions,
to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940
Act, is at least equal to 200 (or 150 if certain requirements are met) immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any
preferred stock or publicly traded debt securities are outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our stockholders
or the repurchasing of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or
repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to
asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to our Business Because
we use borrowed funds to make investments or fund our business operations, we are exposed to risks typically associated with leverage
which increase the risk of investing in us. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule
17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions.
Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased
or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code s requirements. The code of ethics is available
at our website, www.phenixfc.com , and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov .

Privacy
Policy 

We
are committed to maintaining the privacy of stockholders and to safeguarding our non-public personal information. The following information
is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we
may share information with select other parties. 

Generally,
we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information
of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former
stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer
agent or third party administrator). 

We
restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to our employees with a legitimate business need for the information.
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders. 

Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures 

Our
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by management and our independent
directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 

Proxy
Policies 

Our
proxy voting decisions are made by our investment professionals, who review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a shareholder
vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by the Company. Although the Company generally votes against proposals
that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons
to do so. We generally do not believe it is necessary to engage the services of an independent third party to assist in issue analysis
and vote recommendation for proxy proposals. Under certain circumstances and when deemed in the best interests of shareholders, the Company
may, in the discretion of its officers, refrain from exercising its proxy voting right for a particular decision. 

To
ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process
disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with
any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited
from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties, unless such employee
has received pre-approval from our Chief Compliance Officer.

Other 

Under
the 1940 Act, we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below NAV per share. We may, however, issue and
sell our common stock, at a price below the current NAV of the common stock, or issue and sell warrants, options or rights to acquire
such common stock, at a price below the current NAV of the common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our
best interest and in the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making such
sales within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than
a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities. However, we
currently do not have the requisite stockholder approval, nor do we have any current plans to seek stockholder approval, to sell or issue
shares of our common stock at a price below NAV per share. 

19 

In
addition, at our 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders we received approval from our stockholders to authorize us, with the approval of
our board of directors, to issue securities to, subscribe to, convert to, or purchase shares of the Company s common stock in one
or more offerings, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the proxy statement. Such authorization has no expiration. 

We expect
to be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 

We
are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement.
Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising
from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person s
office. 

We
adopted written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and will review these
policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We have designated a Chief Compliance
Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 

Election
to Be Taxed as a RIC 

We
have elected and intend to qualify annually to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be
subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders
as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements
(as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90 of our investment
company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over
realized net long-term capital losses (the Distribution Requirement ). 

Taxation
as a RIC 

As
a RIC, if we satisfy the Distribution Requirement, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment
company taxable income and net capital gain, defined as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses, we timely
distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any net income or net capital
gain not distributed to our stockholders. 

We will be subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal
excise tax of 4 on undistributed income if we do not distribute at least the sum of 98 of our ordinary income in any calendar year,
98.2 of our capital gain net income for each one-year period ending on October 31 of such year, and any income and capital gain net
income that we recognized in preceding years, but were not distributed during such years, and on which we did not pay U.S. federal income
tax. Depending on the level of investment company taxable income ICTI earned in a tax year and the amount of net capital
gains recognized in such tax year, we may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next
tax year. In order to eliminate our liability for income tax, and to the extent necessary to maintain our qualification as a RIC, any
such carryover ICTI and net capital gains must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior
to the 15th day of the 9th month after the close of the taxable year in which such ICTI was generated. To the extent that we determine
that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions for U.S. federal
excise tax purposes, we accrue U.S. federal excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. On December
13, 2024, the Company identified that it did not distribute at least 90 of its investment company taxable income for the tax year ended
September 30, 2023. The Company filed Form 8927 on December 16, 2024 notifying the IRS. 

In order
to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

qualify
 to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 

derive
 in each taxable year at least 90 of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans,
 gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock
 or securities, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships (generally, partnerships
 that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that could qualify
 as RICs if such partnerships were domestic corporations) (the 90 Income Test and 

20 

diversify
 our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 

at
 least 50 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and
 other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5 of the value of our assets or more than
 10 of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 

no
 more than 25 of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other
 RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged
 in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships
 (the Diversification Tests ). 

We
may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or
foreign income and franchise or withholding liabilities. 

Any
underwriting fees paid by us are not deductible. We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive
cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as
debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in
income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing
such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment
company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the
Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 

Although
we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy the Distribution Requirement.
However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior
securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage tests are met. See Business Regulation 
Senior Securities. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to satisfy the Distribution Requirement may be limited by (1) the
illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification
Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Distribution Requirement or avoid the imposition of excise tax, we may make such
dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 

Some
of the income and fees that we may recognize will not count towards satisfaction of the 90 Income Test. In order to ensure that such
income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90 Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income
and fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will
be required to pay corporate level U.S. federal income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income
and fees. 

Failure
to Qualify as a RIC 

If
we were unable to continue to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income
at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions,
including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to
the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees
would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would
be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder s tax basis in their shares of the RIC, and any distributions
in excess of tax basis would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years,
to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate level U.S. federal income tax on any net built-in gains
with respect to certain of our assets i.e. , the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses
that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or
when recognized over the next five years. 

21 

Company
Investments 

Certain
of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) disallow,
suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, including the dividends received deduction, (2) convert lower
taxed long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gains or ordinary income, (3) convert
ordinary loss or a deduction into capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (4) cause us to recognize income or gain
without a corresponding receipt of cash, (5) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed
to occur, (6) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (7) produce income that will not qualify
as good income for purposes of the 90 Income Test described above. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections
and may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification as a
RIC. 

Investments
we make in securities issued at a discount or providing for deferred interest or payment of interest in kind are subject to special tax
rules that will affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders. For example, if we hold debt obligations that
are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases,
with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we will generally be required to accrue daily as income a portion of the discount
and to distribute such income each year to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes. Since in certain circumstances we may recognize
income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty making distributions in the amounts necessary
to satisfy the requirements for maintaining RIC tax treatment and for avoiding U.S. federal income and excise taxes. Accordingly, we
may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce
new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail
to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and thereby be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. 

Gain
or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be
treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long term or short term, depending on how long we held a particular
warrant. 

In
the event we invest in foreign securities, we may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes with respect to those securities.
In that case, our yield on those securities would be decreased. We do not expect to satisfy the requirements necessary to pass through
to our stockholders their share of the foreign taxes paid by us. 

If
we purchase shares in a passive foreign investment company (a PFIC ), we may be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on a portion of any excess distribution or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such
income is distributed as a taxable dividend by us to our stockholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on
us in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains. If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a qualified
electing fund under the Code (a QEF ), in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to
include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed
to us. Alternatively, we may be able to elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in certain PFICs; in this
case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value
to the extent it does not exceed prior increases included in income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year
income in excess of our distributions from PFICs and our proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will
nevertheless be subject to the Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4 U.S. federal excise tax
described above. 

Income
inclusions from a QEF will be good income for purposes of the 90 Income Test provided that they are derived in
connection with our business of investing in stocks and securities or the QEF distributes such income to us in the same taxable year
in which the income is included in our income.

Cybersecurity 

Cybersecurity
Program Overview 

Our
cybersecurity program is designed to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. The cyber risk management
program involves risk assessments, implementation of security measures, and ongoing monitoring of systems and networks, including networks
on which we rely. We engage external experts, including cybersecurity assessors and consultants, to evaluate cybersecurity measures and
risk management processes. We engage and depend on service providers to actively monitor the current threat landscape in an effort to
identify material risks arising from new and evolving cybersecurity threats. Our finance and compliance personnel identify and oversee
risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of such service providers. 

Board
Oversight of Cybersecurity Risks 

Our
Board provides strategic oversight on cybersecurity matters, including risks associated with cybersecurity threats. The Board receives
periodic updates from our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Compliance Officer, regarding the overall state of our cybersecurity
program, information on the current threat landscape, and risks from cybersecurity threats and cybersecurity incidents. 

Management s
Role in Cybersecurity Risk Management 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for assessing and managing material risks
from cybersecurity threats. Members of Company management possess relevant expertise in various disciplines that are key to effectively
managing such risks, such as regulatory compliance and corporate governance and rely on third-party service providers to provide expertise
with respect to information technology and cybersecurity. Our management is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation,
and remediation of cybersecurity incidents, primarily through the receipt of notifications from service providers. 

Assessment
of Cybersecurity Risk 

The
potential impact of risks from cybersecurity threats are assessed regularly, including how such risks could materially affect our
business strategy, operational results, and financial condition. During the reporting period, we have not identified
any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previous cybersecurity incidents, that we believe have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, us, including our business strategy, operational results, and financial condition.

(1) Net
 asset value per share is determined as of the last day in the relevant quarter and therefore
 may not reflect the net asset value per share on the date of the high and low market prices.
 The net asset value per share shown is based on outstanding shares at the end of the period. 

(2) Calculated
 as of the respective high or low closing market price less quarter end net asset value divided
 by the quarter end net asset value.

For
all periods presented in the table above, there was no return of capital included in any distribution. 

Shares
of business development companies may trade at a market price that is less than the value of the net assets attributable to those shares.
The possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount or premium to net asset value is separate and distinct from
the risk that our net asset value will decrease. 

The
last reported closing price of our common stock on December 13, 2024 was 47.90 per share, approximately 60.35 of the Company s
then-current NAV. As of December 13, 2024 we had 11 stockholders of record of our common stock, which did not include stockholders for
whom shares are held in nominee or street name. 

Sales
of Unregistered Securities 

We did not
sell any securities within the past three years that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

Overview 

We
are an internally-managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the
1940 Act. In addition, we have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under
Subchapter M of the Code. Through December 31, 2020, we were an externally managed company. Since January 1, 2021, we have operated under
our present internalized management structure. 

We
commenced operations and completed our initial public offering on January 20, 2011. Under our internalized management structure, our
activities are managed by our senior professionals and are supervised by our board of directors, of which a majority of the members are
independent of us. 

The
Company s investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation. The management team seeks to achieve this
objective primarily through making loans, private equity or other investments in privately-held companies. The Company may also make
debt, equity or other investments in publicly-traded companies. These investments may also include investments in other BDCs, closed-end
funds or REITs. We may also pursue other strategic opportunities and invest in other assets or operate other businesses to achieve our
investment objective, such as operating and managing an asset-based lending business. The portfolio generally consists of senior secured
first lien term loans, senior secured second lien term loans, senior secured bonds, preferred equity and common equity. Occasionally,
we will receive warrants or other equity participation features which we believe will have the potential to increase total investment
returns. Our loan and other debt investments are primarily rated below investment grade or are unrated. Investments in below investment
grade securities are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal
when due. 

55 

As
a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our
total assets in qualifying assets, including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents,
U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, we are only allowed to borrow
money such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200 (or 150 if, pursuant to the 1940 Act, certain requirements
are met) after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. To maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must meet specified source-of-income
and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must timely distribute at least 90 of our
net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, for the taxable
year. 

Revenues 

We
generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt that we hold and dividends and capital gains, if any, on our equity investments
that we may acquire in portfolio companies. We invest our assets primarily in privately held companies with enterprise or asset values
between 25 million and 250 million and generally focus on investment sizes of 10 million to 50 million. We believe that pursuing
opportunities of this size offers several benefits including reduced competition, a larger investment opportunity set and the ability
to minimize the impact of financial intermediaries. We expect our debt investments to bear interest at either a fixed or floating rate.
Interest on debt will be payable generally either monthly or quarterly. In some cases our debt investments may provide for a portion
of the interest to be PIK. To the extent interest is PIK, it will be payable through the increase of the principal amount of the obligation
by the amount of interest due on the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of such obligation. The principal amount of the debt
and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form
of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance or investment management services
and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees will be recognized as earned. 

Expenses 

Under
our internally managed structure, we bear all costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to: 

our
 organization and continued corporate existence; 

calculating
 our net asset value NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); 

expenses,
 including travel expense, incurred by our professionals or payable to third parties performing due diligence on prospective portfolio
 companies, monitoring our investments and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; 

interest
 payable on debt incurred to finance our investments; 

the
 costs of all offerings of common shares and other securities; 

operating
 costs associated with employing investment professionals and other staff;

Long-Term
Cash Incentive Plan 

On
May 9, 2022, the board of directors of the Company adopted the PhenixFIN 2022 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan (the CIP pursuant
to the recommendation by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors. The CIP provides for performance-based cash awards to
key employees of the Company, as approved by the Compensation Committee, based on the achievement of pre-established financial goals
for the approved performance period. The performance goals may be expressed as one or a combination of net asset value of the Company,
net asset value per share of the Company s common stock, changes in the market price of shares of the Company s common stock,
individual performance metrics and/or such other goals and objectives the Committee considers relevant in connection with accomplishing
the purposes of the CIP. 

In
connection with the approval of the CIP, the Compensation Committee in April 2022 approved awards for the three-year performance period
commencing on October 1, 2021 and ending on September 30, 2024 (the 2022 LTIP Plan ). Each participant is eligible to receive
an amount of cash equal to 0 -200 of the target award set forth in the table below Target Performance Award ), based on
the achievement of net asset value NAV and NAV per share goals (weighted at 30 and 70 , respectively) as of the end
of the performance period (the Performance Goals ). Performance is evaluated separately for each Performance Goal. No payment
is made with respect to a Performance Goal if a threshold level of performance is not achieved. Each Performance Goal is subject to (i)
a threshold level of performance at which a percentage of the Target Performance Award attributable to that Performance Goal may be paid
and below which no payment is made pursuant to an award, (ii) a target level of performance at which 100 of the Target Performance Award
attributable to that Performance Goal may be paid and (iii) a maximum level of performance, at which 200 of the Target Performance Award
attributable to that Performance Goal may be paid, in each case subject to such other terms and conditions of an award. Between threshold,
target and maximum performance levels for each Performance Goal, the portion of that award attributed to the Performance Goals shall
be interpolated in a linear progression. 

In
December 2022, pursuant to the CIP, the Compensation Committee approved awards for Mr. Lorber and Ms. McMillan for the three-year performance
period commencing on October 1, 2022 and ending on September 30, 2025 (the 2023 LTIP Plan ). Each participant is eligible
to receive an amount of cash equal to a percentage of the target award amount set forth above based on the factors described above. The
Compensation Committee, in approving the awards, evaluated each Performance Goal separately. 

57 

In
December 2023, pursuant to the CIP, the Compensation Committee approved awards for Mr. Lorber and Ms. McMillan for the three-year performance
period commencing on October 1, 2023 and ending on September 30, 2026 (the 2024 LTIP Plan ). Each participant is eligible
to receive an amount of cash equal to a percentage of their target award amount set forth above based on the factors described above.
The Compensation Committee, in approving the awards, evaluated each Performance Goal separately. 

The Target Performance Award for each executive officer for the 2022
LTIP Plan, the 2023 LTIP Plan, and the 2024 LTIP Plan is set forth in the table below: 

Name and Title

for these awards. During the year ended September 30, 2022 the Company did not record an accrual. To date, no amounts have been paid
under these awards.

We
rate the risk profile of each of our debt investments based on the following categories: 

Credit 

Rating 
 
 Definition 

1 
 
 Investments that are performing
 above expectations. 

2 
 
 Investments that are performing
 within expectations, with risks that are neutral or favorable compared to risks at the time of origination. All new loans are rated
 2 . 

3 
 
 Investments that are performing
 below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of interest, dividend or principal is expected. Companies
 rated 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants, however, loan payments are generally not past due. 

4 
 
 Investments that are performing
 below expectations and for which risk has increased materially since origination. Some loss of interest or dividend is expected but
 no loss of principal. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past
 due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). 

5 
 
 Investments that are performing
 substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants
 are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Some loss of principal is expected. 

The
following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of September

Interest
and Financing Expenses 

Interest
and financing expenses for the year ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.1 million, or 19.5 , compared to the year ended September
30, 2023. The increase in interest and financing expenses was primarily due to increased interest expense on the Credit Facility from
increased borrowings during the year. 

Interest
and financing expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 increased by 0.4 million, or 8.2 , compared to the year ended September
30, 2022. The increase in interest and financing expenses was primarily due to interest expense on the Credit Facility which was issued
on December 15, 2022, partially offset by a decrease due to the full repayment of the 2023 Notes on January 17, 2023. 

Salaries and Benefits 

Salaries and benefits expenses for the year ended
September 30, 2024 increased by 2.7 million, or 63.6 , compared to the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in salaries and benefits
expenses was primarily due to increased bonus accruals during the year. 

Interest and financing expenses for the year
ended September 30, 2023 increased by 1.2 million, or 41.8 , compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in salaries
and benefits expenses was primarily due to increased bonus accruals during the year. 

Professional
Fees and General and Administrative Expenses 

Professional
fees and general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.2 million, or 7.1 , compared to the
year ended September 30, 2023. This resulted primarily from a decrease in miscellaneous expenses. 

Professional
fees and general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased by 0.1 million, or 2.3 , compared to the
year ended September 30, 2022. This resulted primarily from a decrease in miscellaneous expenses. 

Net
Realized Gains/Losses from Investments 

We
measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of an investment,
without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. 

During the year ended September 30, 2024, we recognized
 7.3 million of net realized gains on our portfolio investments. The realized gains were primarily due to a realized gain on Maritime
Wireless Holdings for 7.0 million and a realized gain on Kemmerer Operations, LLC for 8.5 million, offset by a loss on the sale of 1888
Industrial Services for 8.8 million. 

During the year ended September 30, 2023, we recognized
 11.5 million of net realized losses on our portfolio investments. The realized losses were primarily due to the restructuring of one
investment and the full repayments of two investments. 

During the year ended September 30, 2022, we
recognized 5.2 million of net realized gains on our portfolio investments. The realized gains were primarily due to the partial and
full repayments of two investments and the restructuring of three investments, offset by realized losses due to the sale of three investments
and the repayment of four investments. 

Realized
loss on extinguishment of debt 

In
the event that we modify or extinguish our debt prior to maturity, we account for it in accordance with ASC 470-50, Modifications and
Extinguishments, in which we measure the difference between the reacquisition price of the debt and the net carrying amount of the debt,
which includes any unamortized debt issuance costs. 

During
the year ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not recognize a net loss on extinguishment of debt. 

During
the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of 0.3 million, which was due to the
Company s 55.3 million repayment of the 2023 Notes on December 16, 2021. 

61 

Net
Unrealized Appreciation/Depreciation on Investments 

Net
change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments reflects the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. 

For
the year ended September 30, 2024, we had 5.7 million of net change in unrealized appreciation on investments. The net unrealized appreciation
resulted from the reversal of the unrealized loss on 1888 Industrial Services and unrealized appreciation primarily on Chimera Investment
Corporation, FST Holdings Parent LLC, Power Stop LLC, and PHH Mortgage Corporation, offset by the reversal of the unrealized gain on
Maritime Wireless Holdings and Kemmerer Operations, LLC. 

For
the year ended September 30, 2023, we had 31.9 million of net change in unrealized appreciation on investments. The net unrealized appreciation
was comprised of 1.9 million of net unrealized depreciation on investments and 33.8 million of net unrealized appreciation that resulted
from the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on investments that were realized, partially sold, or written-off during
the year. 

For
the year ended September 30, 2022, we had 14.5 million of net change in unrealized depreciation on investments. The net unrealized depreciation
was comprised of 21.3 million of net unrealized depreciation on investments and 6.9 million of net unrealized appreciation that resulted
from the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on investments that were realized, partially sold, or written-off during
the year. 

Provision
for Deferred Taxes 

Certain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal
and state income taxes. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes, but are consolidated
for GAAP purposes, and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial
reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries. For the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a change in provision
for deferred taxes of 0.9 million. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not record a change in provision
for deferred taxes. 

Changes
in Net Assets from Operations 

For
the year ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 18.6 million compared to a
net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 26.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, and a net decrease in net
assets resulting from operations of 6.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 as a result of the factors discussed above. Based
on 2,040,253, 2,092,326 and 2,323,601 weighted average common shares outstanding for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022,
respectively, our per share net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was 9.13, 12.87 and (2.63) for the years
ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As
a RIC, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for
investment purposes. To fund growth, we have a number of alternatives available to increase capital, including raising equity, increasing
debt, and funding from operational cash flow. 

Our
liquidity and capital resources historically have been generated primarily from the net proceeds of public offerings of common stock,
advances from the Credit Facility and net proceeds from the issuance of notes as well as cash flows from operations. In the future, we
may generate cash from future offerings of securities, future borrowings and cash flows from operations, including interest earned from
the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
Our primary use of funds is investments in our targeted asset classes, cash distributions to our stockholders, and other general corporate
purposes. 

As of September
30, 2024 and 2023, we had 67.6 million and 6.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. 

62 

In
order to maintain our RIC tax treatment under the Code, we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable
income, but we may also elect to periodically spill over certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next
tax year. In addition, as a BDC, for each taxable year we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior
securities, which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200 (or 150 if, pursuant to the
1940 Act, certain requirements are met). This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. 

On
January 11, 2021, the Company announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase program. On February 9, 2022, the Board
of Directors approved the expansion of the amount authorized for repurchase under the Company s share repurchase program from 15
million to 25 million. On February 8, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the further expansion of the amount authorized for repurchase
under the Company s share repurchase program from 25 million to 35 million. Under the share repurchase program, the Company repurchased
an aggregate of 703,931 shares of common stock through September 30, 2024, or 25.8 of shares outstanding as of the program s inception,
with a total cost of 28.1 million. The total remaining amount authorized under the expanded share repurchase program at September 30,
2024 was approximately 6.9 million. 

Credit
Facility 

On December 15, 2022, the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries executed a three-year, 50 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility with WoodForest Bank, N.A. WoodForest ), Valley National Bank, and Axiom Bank, (collectively, the Lenders ). WoodForest is the administrative
agent, sole bookrunner and sole lead arranger. As of September 30, 2024, there was 78.1 million outstanding borrowings by the Company
under the Credit Facility. 

Outstanding
loans under the Credit Facility bear a monthly interest rate at Term SOFR + 2.90 . The Company is also subject to a commitment fee of
0.25 , which shall accrue on the actual daily amount of the undrawn portion of the revolving credit. The Credit Facility contains customary
representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default for credit
facilities of this type, including (without limitation): nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts after a stated grace
period; inaccuracy of material representations and warranties; change of control; violations of covenants, subject in certain cases to
stated cure periods; and certain bankruptcies and liquidations. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Company may be required
to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. 

On
February 21, 2024 (the First Amendment Effective Date ), in order to increase the size of the Credit Facility, the parties
to the Credit Facility amended the terms of the Credit Facility, effective as of the First Amendment Effective Date (the First
Amendment ). The First Amendment increased the principal amount of loan available under the Credit Facility by 12.5 million to
 62.5 million. All other material terms of the Credit Facility remain unchanged. 

On
August 5, 2024 (the Second Amendment Effective Date ), in order to increase the size of the Credit Facility, the parties
to the Credit Facility amended the Credit Facility, effective as of the Second Amendment Effective Date (the Second Amendment ).
The Second Amendment increased the principal amount of loan available under the Credit Facility by 25 million to 87.5 million. All
other material terms of the Credit Facility remain unchanged.

Contractual
Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had commitments under loan and financing agreements to fund up to 1.6 million to two portfolio companies
and 3.4 million to four portfolio companies, respectively. These commitments are primarily composed of senior secured delayed draw term
loans and revolvers, and the determination of their fair value is included in the Consolidated Schedules of Investments. The commitments
are generally subject to the borrowers meeting certain criteria such as compliance with covenants and certain operational metrics. The
terms of the borrowings and financings subject to commitment are comparable to the terms of other loan and equity securities in our portfolio.

 Lease Obligation means a rent payment obligation under a lease classified as an operating lease and disclosed pursuant to ASC 842,

Distributions 

We
have elected, and intend to continue to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter
M of the Code. As a RIC, in any taxable year with respect to which we timely distribute at least 90 percent of the sum of our (i) investment
company taxable income (which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized
net long-term capital losses) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and (ii) net tax exempt interest income (which
is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions), we (but not our stockholders) generally will
not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders.
We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income, but we may also elect to periodically spill over certain excess
undistributed taxable income from one tax year to the next tax year. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment
company taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment
company taxable income, and pay the associated federal corporate income tax or excise tax, described below. 

65 

Amounts
not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S.
federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be deemed to have distributed) during each calendar year
an amount equal to the sum of: 

1) 
 at
 least 98.0 of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year; 

2) 
 at
 least 98.2 of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year
 period ending on October 31st of the calendar year; and 

3) 
 income
 realized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we did not pay federal income tax. 

While
we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4 U.S. federal excise tax,
sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of the tax. In that
event, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 

To
the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for a taxable year, a portion of those distributions
may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stockholders should read any written disclosure
accompanying a distribution carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. 

We
have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend
or other distribution, each stockholder that has not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends
automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders who receive distributions
in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash
distributions. 

On May 9, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a special dividend
in the amount of 2,645,925. This dividend was paid on June 10, 2024 to stockholders of record as of May 27, 2024. During the year ended
September 30, 2022, a special dividend was declared in the amount of 265,798 on June 24, 2022 payable on July 13, 2022 to Stockholders
of record on July 5, 2022. The Company did not declare any regular distribution payments during the years ended September 30, 2024,
2023 and 2022. 

Related
Party Transactions 

We
have adopted a formal business code of conduct and ethics that governs the conduct of our CEO, CFO, chief accounting officer (which role
is currently fulfilled by our CFO) and controller (Covered Officers). Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed
by both the 1940 Act and the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires that all Covered Officers
promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between an individual s
personal and professional relationships. Pursuant to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, each Covered Officer must disclose to the
Company s CCO any conflicts of interest, or actions or relationships that might give rise to a conflict. Any approvals or waivers
under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics must be considered by the disinterested directors. 

66 

During the
year ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into a related party transaction with NVTN LLC whereby the 11.9 million of equity
of Maritime Wireless Holdings LLC was transferred to NVTN LLC. 

Due
from/to Affiliates 

Due
from affiliates at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 consists of certain legal and general and administrative expenses paid by
the Company on behalf of certain of its affiliates. Due to affiliates at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 consists of certain
expenses payable by the Company to certain of its affiliates. 

Pledge
and Security Agreement 

In
connection with the Credit Facility discussed in Note 5, the Company has entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement with the Lenders
pursuant to which the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries have pledged all their assets, including the cash and securities held
in the Company s custodial account with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as collateral for any borrowings made by the Company
pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The Lenders have the typical rights and remedies of a secured lender under the Uniform Commercial Code,
including the right to foreclose on the collateral pledged by the Company. 

On
February 21, 2024, the Pledge and Security Agreement was amended to (i) release and terminate the security interest in the equity interest
of FlexFIN, LLC, pledged by PhenixFIN Investment Holdings LLC, (ii) grant a security interest in the membership interest of FlexFIN Holdco
LLC, pledged by PhenixFIN Investment Holdings LLC, and (iii) reflect equity interests of certain subsidiaries held by the Company and
its subsidiary in the exhibits. 

On
August 5, 2024, the Pledge and Security Agreement was further amended to join an additional subsidiary of the Company as a Guarantor
and grant a security interest in the equity interest of such additional subsidiary. 

On
September 30, 2024, the Pledge and Security Agreement was further amended to exclude assets owned by excluded subsidiaries from the collateral
package and reflect the equity interest of an additional subsidiary of the Company in the exhibits. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could
materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies. 

Valuation
of Portfolio Investments 

The
Company follows ASC 820 for measuring the fair value of portfolio investments. Fair value is the price that would be received in the
sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where
available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable
prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation
and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity.
The Company s fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Financial investments recorded
at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated
with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation
of the investment as of the measurement date. Investments which are valued using NAV as a practical expedient are excluded from this
hierarchy, and certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The three levels are
defined below: 

Level
 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 

67 

Level
 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly
 or indirectly. 

Level
 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 

We
value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations, which are generally obtained from an
independent pricing service or multiple broker-dealers or market makers. We weight the use of third-party broker quotes, if any, in determining
fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote
was an indicative price or binding offer. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments
in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under
our valuation policy and process. We may seek pricing information with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or
brokers or dealers in order to value such investments. 

Valuation
methods may include comparisons of financial ratios of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies
that are public, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings
and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and other relevant factors. When an external event
such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external
event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that
do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have
been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 

In
December 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which permits a BDC s board of directors to designate its executive
officer(s) as a valuation designee to determine the fair value of its investment portfolio, subject to the oversight of the board. The
Board approved policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 2a-5 and has designated Ellida McMillan, the Company s CFO, to serve as
the Board s valuation designee Valuation Designee ), subject to the Board s oversight, effective September
8, 2022. 

With
respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board oversees and our Valuation Designee undertakes
a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 

Our
 quarterly valuation process generally begins with each investment being initially valued by a Valuation Firm. 

Available
 third-party market data will be reviewed by Company personnel designated by the Valuation Designee Fair Value Personnel and the Valuation Firm. 

Available
 portfolio company data and general industry data is then reviewed by the Fair Value Personnel. 

Preliminary
 valuation conclusions are then documented by the Valuation Firm and discussed with the Fair Value Personnel. 

The
 Valuation Designee then determines the fair value of each investment in the Company s portfolio in good faith based on such
 discussions, the Company s Valuation Policy and the Valuation Firms final estimated valuations. 

The Valuation Designee s report is then presented to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee. 

In
following these approaches, the types of factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include available current
market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples; security
covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company s
ability to make payments; the portfolio company s earnings and discounted cash flows; the markets in which the portfolio company
does business; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and
the principal market and enterprise values.

Determination
of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates made by management. The notes to our consolidated financial statements refer
to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial
statements. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Our revenue
recognition policies are as follows: 

Investments
and Related Investment Income: We account for investment transactions on a trade-date basis and interest income, adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is recorded on an accrual basis. For investments with contractual PIK interest,
which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will not
accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not collectible. Origination, closing and/or
commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are recognized as income when the investment transaction closes. Other
fees are capitalized as deferred revenue and recorded into income over the respective period. Prepayment penalties received by the Company
for debt instruments paid back to the Company prior to the maturity date are recorded as income upon receipt. Realized gains or losses
on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of investment,
without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We report changes in the fair value of investments that are measured
at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations. 

Non-accrual:
 We place loans on non-accrual status when principal and interest payments are past due by 90 days or more, or when there is reasonable
doubt that we will collect principal or interest. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Interest
payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment.
Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in our management s judgment,
are likely to remain current. At September 30, 2024, certain investments in three portfolio companies held by the Company were
on non-accrual status with a combined fair value of approximately 2.4 million, or 1.1 of the fair value of our portfolio. At September
30, 2023, certain investments in four portfolio companies held by the Company were on non-accrual status with a combined fair value of
approximately 6.5 million, or 2.9 of the fair value of our portfolio. 

Federal
Income Taxes 

The
Company has elected, and intends to continue to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter
M of the Code and it intends to operate in a manner so as to maintain its RIC tax treatment. To do so, among other things, the Company
is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and must timely distribute to its stockholders at
least 90 of the sum of investment company taxable income ICTI including PIK, as defined by the Code, and net tax exempt
interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for each taxable year.
The Company will be subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax of 4 on undistributed income if it does not distribute at least
98 of its net ordinary income for any calendar year and 98.2 of its capital gain net income for each one-year period ending on October
31 of such calendar year and any income realized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which it did not pay federal income
tax. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year dividend
distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4 excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that
its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions for excise tax purposes,
the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. Any such carryover ICTI must
be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year
which generated such ICTI. 

Because
federal income tax requirements differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax requirements may differ from net investment income
and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are
reclassified among capital accounts in the consolidated financial statements to reflect their tax character. Temporary differences arise
when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. Differences in classification may also
result from the treatment of short-term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes.

Recent
Developments 

On October 1, 2024, the Company consummated the acquisition of approximately
80 of the equity of The National Security Group, an Alabama based insurance holding company NSG ). NSG is a nationwide
underwriter of life, accident, and health insurance. In addition, NSG is a specialty underwriter of property and casualty insurance throughout
the southeast, other than Florida and Louisiana. The Company has entered into a contract with NSG to manage a portion of its investment
assets. 

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding
and our interest income from portfolio investments and cash and cash equivalents. Our investment income will be affected by changes in
various interest rates, including SOFR, to the extent our debt investments include floating interest rates. In the future, we expect
other loans in our portfolio will have floating interest rates. In 2023, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates and has
indicated additional interest rate increases may come. In addition, U.S. and global capital markets and credit markets have experienced
a higher level of stress due to the higher interest rate environment, pandemics, and other market events, which has resulted in an increase
in the level of volatility across such markets. We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments
such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. For the year ended September 30, 2024, we
did not engage in hedging activities. 

As
of September 30, 2024, 53.7 of our income-bearing investment portfolio bore interest based on floating rates based upon fair value.
The substantial majority of this component of our portfolio bore interest based on a SOFR reference rate. Certain such investments used
a LIBOR reference rate at September 30, 2024. A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could
result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in the applicable reference rates are not offset by a corresponding
increase in the spread over the reference rates that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses, including
with respect to any income incentive fee, or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities tied to reference
rates. In contrast, a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to any
variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. In addition, a rise in interest
rates may increase the likelihood that a portfolio company defaults on a loan. However, many of our variable rate investments provide
for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold
amount. The composition of our floating rate debt investments by cash interest rate floor as of September 30, 2024 was as follows (dollars

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
PhenixFIN Corporation: 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of assets
and liabilities of PhenixFIN Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30,
2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30,
2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30,
2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those
risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Such procedures also included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, by correspondence with custodians,
portfolio companies, agents or by other appropriate auditing procedures. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated
below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to
be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter
does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Fair value of investments 

As discussed in Notes 2, 3 and 4 of the consolidated financial statements,
the Company measures its investments at fair value. The Company determines the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded
and whose market quotations are not readily available using one or more methodologies including the market approach and income approach,
which requires the Company to make subjective judgments and estimates using unobservable inputs. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value
of level 3 investments was 140.3 million. 

F- 2 

We identified the
assessment of the fair value of level 3 investments for which unobservable inputs were used as a critical audit matter. The key assumptions
used to estimate the fair value of these investments related to the market yield associated with the portfolio company used in an income
approach and the selection of financial performance multiples of comparative companies used in a market approach. Evaluating these assumptions
involved a high degree of subjective auditor judgment and involvement of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge. Changes
in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of investments. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to
address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design of certain internal controls over the Company s process to estimate
the fair value of level 3 investments, including controls related to the determination of market yield and financial performance multiples
assumptions. We evaluated the Company s ability to estimate fair value by comparing prior period fair values for a selection of
investments to transaction prices occurring subsequent to the prior period valuation date. We involved valuation professionals with specialized
skills and knowledge who, for a selection of the Company s investments, assisted in evaluating the Company s estimate of fair
value by developing an independent estimate of fair value using independent market yields and financial performance multiples that were
developed using relevant market and portfolio company financial information and comparing such estimates to the fair values recorded by
the Company for the selected investments.

as the Company s auditor since 2023.

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of PhenixFIN Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations,
changes in net assets, and cash flows of PhenixFIN Corporation (the Company), for the year ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the results of its operations, changes in its net assets, and its cash flows for the year ended
September 30, 2022 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of investments owned as of September 30, 2022, by correspondence with the custodians, directly with designees of the portfolio
companies and debt agents, as applicable, when replies were not received from designees of the portfolio companies and debt agents, we
performed other auditing procedures. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the
fair value measurement of the Company s debt and derivative investments are market yields. Increases in market yields would result
in lower fair value measurements. 

The significant unobservable inputs used in the
fair value measurement of the Company s equity/warrants investments are comparable company multiples of revenue or EBITDA for the
latest twelve months LTM ), next twelve months NTM or a reasonable period a market participant would consider.
Increases in EBITDA multiples in isolation would result in higher fair value measurement.

after giving effect to such leverage.
The amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed
borrowing. 

However, in March 2018, the Small Business Credit
Availability Act modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from to 
of asset coverage, if certain requirements under the 1940 Act are met. Under the 1940 Act, we are allowed to increase our leverage capacity
if stockholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, when a quorum is present, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive
stockholder approval, we would be allowed to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, the 1940
Act allows the majority of our independent directors to approve an increase in our leverage capacity, and such approval would become effective
after the one-year anniversary of such approval. In either case, we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in
SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks
related to leverage. No approval was requested or obtained and the Company is still subject to the requirement. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company s
asset coverage was after giving effect to leverage and therefore the Company s asset coverage was greater than , the
minimum asset coverage requirement applicable presently to the Company under the 1940 Act. 

As of September 30, 2023, the Company s
asset coverage was after giving effect to leverage and therefore the Company s asset coverage was greater than , the

Commitments and obligations to make Loans as set forth therein.

Documents as Loan Documents . Each Loan Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that this Amendment and each other Amendment Document

it shall be an immediate Event of Default under the Credit Agreement if (i) any representation or warranty made by any Loan Party under
or in connection with this Amendment or any other Amendment Document shall have been incorrect in any respect when made or deemed made,
or (ii) any Loan Party shall fail to perform or observe any term, covenant or agreement contained in this Amendment or any other Amendment
Document. 

9. General
Provisions . Sections 9.01 , 9.03 , 9.06 , 9.07 , 9.09 and 9.10 of the Existing Credit Agreement
shall be incorporated herein by reference, mutatis mutandis.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT 

To the Members 

 FlexFIN, LLC 

 New York, New York 

Opinion 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements
of FlexFIN, LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) which comprise the balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the related
statements of income and members equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FlexFIN, LLC as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of
FlexFIN, LLC and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial
Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, management
is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about FlexFIN,
LLC s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. 

Page 2 

Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit
of the Financial Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and
therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements
are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment
made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 

In performing an audit in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, we: 

Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures
include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of FlexFIN, LLC s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial
statements. 

Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or
events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about FlexFIN, LLC s ability to continue as a going concern for
a reasonable period of time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged
with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal
control related matters that we identified during the audit.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER

NOTE 1 
ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS 

FlexFIN, LLC The Company ),
a Delaware limited liability company organized in July 2021, is a purchaser of gemstones and jewelry with repurchase options. Option extension
fees are charged to the sellers in order to extend those repurchase options in increments of one, two, or three months. In certain circumstances
inventory items may be sold to third parties. The Company does business with both domestic and international entities in the diamond and
jewelry business. 

The Company purchases gemstones and jewelry
via purchase and sale agreements which contain repurchase options in favor of the sellers. While a repurchase option is active, the Company
is prohibited from selling the related inventory, except that some of the inventory may be sold at an agreed upon minimum price (Note
3). The seller must pay an option extension fee in order to maintain the repurchase option. Once an item is no longer subject to a repurchase
option the Company may sell it on its own terms. The majority of the Company s operations are located in the New York metropolitan
area, while most of its revenue is from clients in Belgium.

experienced losses in this account. 

Accounts Receivable, Revenue Recognition and Contracts
with Customers 

The Company generates
revenues from option extension fees collected on asset repurchase option contracts with the sellers. Terms of purchases of inventory are
detailed in the purchase contracts. Sellers of inventory to the Company pay monthly option extension fees to maintain the right to repurchase
inventory assets sold to the Company. The option extension fee on each contract is calculated as a percentage of the purchase price with
rates agreed upon in each transaction. Rates have typically been 0.667 to 1.700 per month, but management reserves the right to raise
the fee rates on future contracts. Option extension fee income is paid by the seller at the beginning of each option extension period
and is nonrefundable. Income is therefore recognized when the purchase is consummated, upon receipt of the goods and disbursement of funds
by the Company. When a repurchase option is exercised by a seller the transaction is recognized as a return of inventory. At September
30, 2024 and 2023, other than option extension fees received in advance the Company has no unfulfilled performance obligations.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Accounts Receivable, Revenue Recognition and Contracts
with Customers (Continued) 

At September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company had no accounts receivable. 

Income Taxes 

As a limited liability company, the Company
is treated as a partnership for Federal, New York State, and New York City income tax purposes. Accordingly, any income or loss is reported
on the members respective income tax returns based on their proportionate share of ownership. Limited liability companies are however
subject to New York City Unincorporated Business Tax when New York City business income exceeds a certain amount. 

The Company s tax filings are subject
to audit by various taxing authorities. The Company s Federal, New York State and New York City income tax returns for the years
ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 remain open to examination by relevant Internal Revenue Service and New York State and City taxing
authorities. In evaluating the Company s tax provisions and accruals, the Company and its members believe that their estimates are
appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. 

New York State Pass-Through Entity Tax (PTET) 

New York State has enacted a new pass-through
entity tax (PTET) for years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The PTET is an optional tax that pass-through entities may elect annually
and allows a pass-through entity to pay state-level taxes on business income and claim a corresponding Federal deduction which in turn
permits the individual members to maximize their eligible deductions subject to the state and local tax (SALT) cap. The Company did not
elect to pay PTET for the tax years beginning January 1, 2024 and 2023 and does not expect to make the election in the future. 

Tax Related Penalties and Interest 

The Company s policy is to record
interest expense and penalties assessed by taxing authorities in operating expenses. During the year ended September 30, 2024 there was
interest and penalties expense related to taxes totaling 1,229. There was no interest and penalties expense related to taxes during the
year ended September 30, 2023. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Inventory 

Restricted, and when applicable unrestricted, inventory is
stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. 

NOTE 3 
RESTRICTED INVENTORY 

Items purchased and subject to seller
repurchase options are reported as restricted inventory. The purchase contracts that establish the seller repurchase options state whether
the items purchased by the Company can be sold for a specified minimum price, or the Company is prohibited from selling the items (Note
1). Management monitors the inventory to ascertain that the value of items is always well above its cost. Should the value of an item
decline below cost management will require the conveyor to provide additional goods. 

At September 30, 2024 and 2023 restricted
inventory that is restricted by the minimum sale price criteria during the repurchase option period totaled 4,005,240 and 4,009,834
at cost, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and 2023 restricted inventory that is completely restricted from being sold during the repurchase
option period totaled 47,624,048 and 34,860,876 at cost, respectively. 

Should a restricted inventory item no
longer be subject to an active seller repurchase option it is classified as inventory held for sale. At September 30, 2024 and 2023 the
Company had no items held for sale.

or items relevant to that seller s repurchase option in exchange for a full return of the purchase amount that it paid and all fees.
Upon expiration of a repurchase option the Company is clear of that commitment and may market the relevant inventory item or items to
third parties on its own terms. 

NOTE 8 CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK 

Major Sellers 

The Company is introduced to sellers
primarily through managers industry reputations and network connections, as well as advertising. Management has decades 
long business relationships with the sellers, stemming from prior business ventures. This may result in the Company earning a substantial
portion of its revenue from relatively few Sellers in any given period. Revenue derived from these contracts may at times exceed 10 of
the Company s total revenue. During the year ended September 30, 2024 two interrelated sellers accounted for 58 and 12 of option
extension fee income. During the year ended September 30, 2023 one seller accounted for 63 of option extension fee income. 

Major inventory items 

At September 30, 2024 there are 3 major items which compose
25 , 25 and 15 of the total cost of restricted inventory.
