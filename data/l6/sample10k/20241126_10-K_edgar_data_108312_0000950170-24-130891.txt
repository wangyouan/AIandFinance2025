Competitive success is based on the development of innovative components and systems that are aligned with the OEMs technology roadmaps to achieve future reliability, emission, efficiency, and fuel flexibility targets. 
 For additional information about our markets and trends in our markets, please see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Government Contracts and Regulation 
 Portions of our business, particularly in our Aerospace segment, are heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including all of the branches of the U.S. military, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA ), and the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Transportation. We also contract with similar government authorities outside the United States, subject in all cases to applicable law. 
 We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things: 
 require accurate, complete, and current disclosure and certification of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contracts; 

impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ), and therefore require robust systems to reconcile; 

impose regulations that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts; 

4 

impose manufacturing specifications and other quality standards that may be more restrictive than for non-government business activities; and 

restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes due to the regulations of the U.S. Government and foreign governments pertaining to the export of certain products and technical data. 

Sales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and entities, or indirectly through third party manufacturers utilizing our parts and subassemblies, collectively represented 17 of our sales for both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. 
 
 Seasonality 
 We believe our sales, in total or in either reportable segment, are not subject to significant seasonal variation. However, our sales have generally been lower in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to the immediately preceding quarter due to fewer working days resulting from the observance of various holidays and scheduled plant shutdowns for annual maintenance. 
 Sales Order Backlog 
 For each of our reportable segments, we have elected to quantify backlog in a manner consistent with the definition of remaining performance obligations. Our remaining performance obligations by segment, excluding material rights, is shown in the table below: 

October 31, 2024 

Percent Expected to be satisfied by September 30, 2025

Our remaining performance obligations relate to the aggregate amount of the total contract transaction price of firm orders for which the performance obligation has not yet been recognized in revenue. 
 Manufacturing 
 We operate manufacturing and assembly plants primarily in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Our products consist of mechanical, electronic, and electromechanical systems and components. 
 Aluminum, iron, and steel are primary raw materials used to produce our mechanical components. Other commodities, such as gold, copper, and nickel, are also used in the manufacture of our products, although in much smaller quantities. We purchase various goods, including component parts and services used in production, logistics, and product development processes from third parties. Generally, there are numerous sources for the raw materials and components used in our products, which we believe are sufficiently available to meet current requirements. 
 We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities' production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and efficiently managing our overall supply costs. We expect our suppliers to maintain adequate levels of quality raw materials and component parts, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support production of our various products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to protect our intellectual property and processes and to monitor and mitigate risks of disruption in our supply base that could cause a business disruption to our production schedules or to our customers. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, business continuity, quality, delivery, and protection of our intellectual property and processes. 
 Our customers expect us to maintain adequate levels of certain finished goods and certain component parts to support our warranty commitments and sales to our aftermarket customers, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support our customers standard and customary needs. We carry certain finished goods and component parts in inventory to meet these rapid delivery requirements of our customers. 
 Research and Development 
 We finance our research and development activities primarily with our own funds. Our research and development costs include basic research, applied research, component and systems development, and concept formulation studies. 
 5 

We collaborate closely with our customers as they develop their technology plans, which leads to new product concepts. We believe this collaboration allows us to develop technology, new systems, and products that are aligned with our customers needs and future performance, which increases the likelihood that our systems and components will be selected for inclusion in the platforms developed by our customers. Further, we believe our close collaboration with our customers during preliminary design stages allows us to provide products that deliver the component and system performance necessary to bring greater value to our customers. This preliminary work may include opportunities to test new products in order to validate concepts and demonstrate performance in challenging environments. We strive to stay ahead of the competition through our modeling, prototyping, and state of the art test capabilities. 
 Aerospace is focused on developing systems and components that we believe will be instrumental in helping our customers achieve their objectives of lower fuel consumption, lighter weight, more efficient performance, reduced emissions, and improved operating economics. We support our engine and airframe customers as they develop next generation designs across the commercial aviation, general aviation, civil private, and military markets. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of: 
 aerospace turbine engine applications, which include commercial, business, and military turbofan engines of various thrust classes, turboshaft engines, and turboprop engines; 

electromechanical and hydraulic actuation systems for flight deck-to-flight surface control of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, and turbine engine nacelles, as well as guidance for weapon systems; and 

motion control components for integration into comprehensive actuation systems. 

Most technology development programs begin years before an expected entry to service, such as those for the next generation of commercial aircraft. Other development programs result in nearer-term product launches associated with new OEM offerings, product upgrades, or product replacements on existing programs. 
 We developed the fuel system, air management system, and actuation hardware for CFM International s LEAP engine program. We also developed actuation system, combustion system, and oil system components for Pratt Whitney s Geared Turbo Fan GTF or PurePower engine program. We continue to support GE Aerospace and CFM for improvements to the LEAP fuel system, and Collins Aerospace and Pratt Whitney for improvements to the PurePower engine programs. 
 Industrial is focused on developing innovative technologies, including integrated control systems and system components, that enable our customers to cost-effectively meet mandated emissions regulations and fuel efficiency demands, allow for usage of a wider range of fuel sources, increase reliability (particularly in harsh environments), and reduce total cost of ownership. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of: 
 products that improve the quality of combustion processes and provide more precise flow of various fuels and gases in our customers gas turbines industrial reciprocating engines fueled by bio-diesel and dual-fuel;

We strive to comply with all federal and local workplace laws and regulations where we do business. We are always looking for ways to exceed compliance standards by utilizing continuous improvement discipline to proactively eliminate risks in the workplace. 
 As of October 31, 2024, we employed approximately 9,300 full-time members of which approximately 2,880 were located outside of the United States, with the majority of such members located in Germany, Poland, and China. 
 In the United States, approximately 13 of our total full-time workforce were union members as of October 31, 2024. All union members in the United States work for our Aerospace segment. The collective bargaining agreements with our union members are generally renewed through contract renegotiation near the contract expiration dates. The MPC Employees Representative Union contract, which covered approximately 800 members as of October 31, 2024, expires September 30, 2025. The Local Lodge 727-N International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreement, which covers approximately 400 members as of October 31, 2024, expires April 23, 2027. 
 In Germany, approximately 13 of our total full-time workforce were union members as of October 31, 2024, all of whom work for our Industrial segment. Our Woodward L Orange members are part of the IG Metall union in Germany. IG Metall covered approximately 1,200 members as of October 31, 2024. 
 We believe we have good, collaborative relationships with our union members and the representative unions. 
 Almost all of our other members in the United States were at-will members as of October 31, 2024, and therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. Our executive officers each have severance and change-in-control agreements which have been filed with the SEC. 
 Outside of the United States, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary, including coordination through local works councils. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. 
 Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing 
 We own numerous patents and other intellectual property, and have licenses for the use of patents and other intellectual property owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. Government has certain rights in our patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of certain government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes as allowed by law. 
 Intellectual property not covered by patents (or patent applications) includes trade secrets and other technological know-how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection, including intellectual property relating to our manufacturing processes and engineering designs. Such unpatented technology, including research, development and engineering technical skills and know-how, as well as unpatented software, is important to our overall business and to the operations of each of our segments. 
 While our intellectual property assets taken together are important, we do not believe our business or either of our segments would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. 
 7 

As of September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes 440,419 of net intangible assets. This value represents the carrying values, net of amortization, of certain assets acquired in various business acquisitions and does not purport to represent the fair value of our acquired intellectual property as of September 30, 2024. 
 Environmental Matters and Climate Change 
 The Company is regulated by federal, state, and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position. 
 We use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing operations. We also own, operate, have acquired, and may in the future acquire facilities that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials. We believe the risk that a significant release of regulated materials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented. From time to time, we engage in environmental remediation activities, generally in coordination with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. In addition, we may be exposed to other environmental costs including participation in superfund sites or other similar jurisdictional initiatives. When it is reasonably probable that we will incur remediation costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for such future costs with a related charge against our earnings. In formulating that estimate and recognizing those costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies, or others, until such recovery is assured. Currently, we have no sites undergoing remediation. 
 Our manufacturing facilities generally do not produce volumes or quantities of byproducts, including greenhouse gases, that would be considered hazardous waste or otherwise harmful to the environment. We do not expect legislation currently pending or expected in the next several years to have a significant negative impact on our operations in any of our segments. 
 Domestic and foreign legislative initiatives on emissions control, renewable energy, and climate change tend to favorably impact the sale of our energy control products. For example, our Industrial segment produces energy control products that help our customers maximize engine efficiency and minimize wasteful emissions, including greenhouse gases. 
 In 2023, we released our fourth sustainability report, where we continue to build upon our commitments to sustainability in areas of environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and corporate governance. We apply a systematic approach to identifying, evaluating, and managing risks across our operations, with the goal to be a supplier, community partner, and employer of choice. 
 The full report can be found on the Sustainability at Woodward section of our website.

Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 The following summarizes important factors that could individually, or together with one or more other factors, affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows: 
 Industry Risks 
 We operate in highly competitive industries and, if we are unable to compete effectively in one or more of our markets, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected. 
 We face intense competition from a number of established competitors in the United States and abroad, some of which are larger in size or are divisions of large, diversified companies with substantially greater financial resources. In addition, global competition continues to increase. Changes in competitive conditions, including the availability of new technologies, products and services, the introduction of new channels of distribution, changes in OEM and aftermarket pricing, and further consolidation of companies in our industries, could impact our relationships with our customers and may adversely affect future sales and margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Further, the markets in which we operate experience rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our technologies and the technological expertise we have developed and maintained could become less valuable if a competitor were to develop a new technology that would allow it to match or exceed the performance of existing technologies at a lower cost. If we are unable to develop competitive technologies, future sales or earnings could be lower than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a relatively small number of customers, which makes our business more vulnerable to fluctuations in sales to these customers and changes in their financial condition. 
 A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a relatively small number of customers. We have fewer customers than many companies with similar sales volumes. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, sales to our largest 5 customers represented approximately 35 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 31 of our accounts receivable. If any of our significant customers were to change suppliers, in-source production, institute significant restructuring or cost-cutting measures, or experience financial distress, these significant customers may substantially reduce, or otherwise be unable to pay for, purchases from us. Accordingly, our consolidated net sales could decrease significantly, or we may experience difficulty collecting, or be unable to collect, amounts due and payable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 The long sales cycle, customer evaluation process, and implementation period of our products and services may increase the costs of obtaining orders and reduce the predictability of sales cycles and our inventory requirements. 
 Our products and services are technologically complex and require significant capital commitments. Prospective customers generally must commit significant resources to test and evaluate our products and to install and integrate them into larger systems. Accordingly, customers often require a significant number of product presentations and demonstrations before reaching a sufficient level of confidence in the product s performance and compatibility to commit to an order. In addition, orders expected in one quarter may shift to another quarter or be cancelled with little advance notice as a result of customers budgetary constraints, internal acceptance reviews, and other factors affecting the timing of customers purchase decisions. The difficulty in forecasting demand increases the challenge in anticipating sales cycles and our inventory requirements, which may cause us to over-produce finished goods and could result in inventory write-offs, or could cause us to under-produce finished goods. Any such over-production or under-production could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Our strategic joint venture with GE Aerospace may make it more difficult to secure long-term sales in certain aerospace markets. 
 In January 2016, Woodward and GE, consummated the formation of a strategic joint venture (the JV and since April 2024, GE has been acting through GE Aerospace. The JV agreement does not restrict Woodward from entering into any market; however, consolidation in the aircraft engine market is increasingly prevalent, resulting in fewer engine manufacturers, and thus it may become more difficult for Woodward to secure new business with GE Aerospace competitors on similar product applications both within and outside the specific markets the JV operates. Additionally, if GE 
 9 

Aerospace fails to win new content in the market space covered by the JV, Woodward may be prevented from expanding content on future commercial aircraft engines in those markets. 
 Commercial, Financial, and Regulatory Risks 
 Suppliers may be unable to provide us with materials of sufficient quality or quantity to meet our production needs at favorable prices or at all which may adversely affect our revenue and margins. 
 We are dependent upon suppliers for parts and raw materials used in the manufacture of products that we sell to our customers, and our raw material costs are subject to commodity market fluctuations and have been impacted by the current inflationary environment. We have experienced shortages of certain parts and raw materials due to challenges in our supply chain, although we have made strategic investments to simplify and strengthen our supply chain. We may continue to experience shortages of parts or raw materials for the same or other reasons, such as the loss of a significant supplier, high overall demand creating shortages in parts and supplies we use, financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters, fluctuations in commodity prices, the imposition of tariffs or other duties, or production or distribution difficulties that may affect one or more of our suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, or logistics support or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Some of our suppliers have experienced, and others may similarly experience, financial difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, and, as a result, we have from time to time been, and may in the future be, unable to meet commitments to our customers and/or incur additional costs. Our customers rely on us to provide on-time delivery and have certain rights if our delivery standards are not maintained. A significant increase in our supply costs, including for raw materials that are subject to commodity price fluctuations, inflationary pressures, and/or the imposition of tariffs, or a protracted interruption of supplies for any reason, could result in the delay of one or more of our customer contracts, increase our costs, result in lost revenue or could damage our reputation and relationships with customers. In addition, quality and sourcing issues that our suppliers may experience can also adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and may result in liability or reputational harm to us. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Our profitability may suffer if we are unable to manage our expenses in connection with sales increases, sales decreases, or if we experience change in product mix. 
 Some of our expenses are relatively fixed in relation to changes in sales volume and are difficult to adjust in the short term. Expenses driven by business activity other than sales level and other long-term expenditures, such as fixed manufacturing costs, capital expenditures, and research and development expenses may be difficult to reduce in a timely manner in response to a reduction in sales. In periods of rapid sales increases it may be difficult to quickly increase our production of finished goods because of our long manufacturing lead times. If a sudden, unanticipated need for raw materials, components and labor arises, we could experience difficulties in sourcing these items at a favorable cost, in sufficient quantities or at all. These factors could result in delays in fulfilling customer sales contracts, lost revenue, damage to our reputation and relationships with our customers, and an inability to meet market demand, which in turn could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities or responding to competitive pressures and could result in an increase in costs leading to a decrease in net earnings or even net losses. In addition, we sell products that have varying profit margins, and fluctuations in the mix of sales of our various products may affect our overall profitability. 
 Reductions, delays or changes in U.S. Government spending could adversely affect our business. 
 Sales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and entities, or indirectly through third party manufacturers, such as tier-one prime contractors, utilizing our parts and subassemblies, accounted for approximately 17 of total sales in both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. 
 The U.S. Government participates in a wide variety of operations, including homeland defense, counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and other defense-related operations that employ our products and services. U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical in nature and is subject to periodic congressional authorization and appropriation actions. The level of U.S. defense spending is hard to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors outside of our control such as changes in the perceived threat environment, prevailing U.S. foreign policy, changes in security, defense, and intelligence strategies and priorities, shifts in domestic and international spending, the macroeconomic environment, tax policy, budget deficits and competing budget priorities, and the political environment and future potential government shutdowns. 
 Defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country s safety, but we can provide no assurance that an increase in defense spending will be allocated to programs that 
 10 

would benefit our business. Decreases in U.S. Government defense spending, changes in the spending allocation, phase-outs or terminations of certain aerospace and defense programs on which we have content could have a material adverse effect on our sales unless they are offset by other aerospace and defense programs and opportunities. If the priorities of the U.S. Government change and/or defense spending is reduced or delayed for any of the reasons discussed above, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
 Our business may be adversely affected by risks unique to government contracting. 
 As a result of our contracts with the U.S. Government, we are subject to certain unique risks, including the risks set forth below: 
 Our U.S. Government contracts and the U.S. Government contracts of our customers are subject to modification, curtailment or termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of a failure by us or our customers to perform under the applicable contract. If any of our contracts are terminated by the U.S. Government, our backlog would be reduced, in accordance with contract terms, by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts. In addition, we are not the prime contractor on most of our contracts for supply to the U.S. Government, and the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor. 

We must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of our U.S. Government contracts and the U.S. Government contracts of our customers. The U.S. Government may change procurement laws and regulations from time to time. A violation of U.S. Government procurement laws or regulations, a change in U.S. Government procurement laws and regulations, or a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability, debarment, or suspension and could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. 

We are subject to government inquiries, audits, and investigations due to our business relationships with the U.S. Government and the heavily regulated industries in which we do business. In addition, our contract costs are subject to audits by the U.S. Government. U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors and subcontractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract would be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, would be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholdings on billed receivables, penalties, and reduced future business. Any inquiries or investigations, including those related to our contract pricing, could potentially result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, suspension, and/or debarment from participating in future business opportunities with the U.S. Government. Such actions could harm our reputation, even if such allegations are later determined to be unfounded, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

The occurrence of one or more of these risks, some of which are out of our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Our debt obligations and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our debt could limit our ability to operate our business or pursue our business strategies, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could significantly reduce stockholder benefits from a change of control event. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total debt was 872,470, including 475,000 in unsecured notes denominated in U.S. dollars issued in private placements and 178,624 of unsecured notes denominated in Euros issued in private placements. We are obligated to make interest and scheduled principal payments under the agreements governing our long-term debt, which requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, and which may reduce the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts and mergers and acquisitions. These debt obligations could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, thereby placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors that have less indebtedness. Further, we may require additional capital to repay our debt obligations when they mature, and such capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
 11 

Our existing revolving credit facility and note purchase agreements impose financial covenants on us and our subsidiaries that require us to maintain certain leverage ratios and minimum levels of consolidated net worth. Certain of these agreements require us to repay outstanding borrowings with portions of the proceeds we receive from certain sales of property or assets and specified future debt offerings. 
 These financial covenants place certain restrictions on our business that may affect our ability to execute our business strategy successfully or take other actions that we believe would be in the best interests of our Company. These covenants include limitations or restrictions, among other things, on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: 
 incur additional indebtedness; 

pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or certain other restricted payments or investments; 

purchase or redeem stock; 

issue stock of our subsidiaries; 

make domestic and foreign investments and extend credit; 

engage in transactions with affiliates; 

transfer and sell assets; 

effect a consolidation or merger or sell, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and 

create liens on our assets to secure debt. 

These agreements contain certain customary events of default, including certain cross-default provisions related to other outstanding debt arrangements. Any breach of the covenants under these agreements or other event of default could cause a default under these agreements and/or a cross-default under our other debt arrangements, which could restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. If there were an event of default under certain provisions of our debt arrangements that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt may be able to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt instrument, plus any required settlement costs, to be due and payable immediately. Our assets and available cash balances may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. If we are unable to repay, refinance, or restructure our indebtedness as required, or amend the covenants contained in these agreements, the lenders or note holders may be entitled to obtain a lien or institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could impact our future profitability. 
 We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution mix of operating income among these different jurisdictions. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred and reflects various estimates, projections, and assumptions that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our future operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate, which could be caused by, among other things: 
 changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates; 

changes in our overall profitability; 

changes in rules or interpretations of existing tax laws; 

changes in U.S. federal tax legislation and tax rates; 

changes in state or non-U.S. government tax legislation and tax rates; 

changes in tax incentives; 

changes in U.S. GAAP; 

changes in the projected realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities; 

changes in management s assessment of the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore; 

changes in management s intentions regarding the amount of earnings reinvested offshore; and 

the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. 

12 

We derive a significant amount of revenue and obtain components from outside of the United States; accordingly, we are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries. 
 In fiscal year 2024, approximately 49 of our total sales were made to customers in jurisdictions outside of the United States (including products manufactured in the United States and sold outside the United States as well as products manufactured in international locations). We also purchase raw materials and components from suppliers outside the United States. Accordingly, our business and results of operations are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including: 
 transportation delays and interruptions; 

political, social and economic instability and disruptions; 

natural disasters or pandemics; 

terrorism, war, and international tensions and conflicts; 

the imposition of taxes, import and export controls, duties and tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions; 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 

different and changing regulatory environments; 

cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations governing various matters worldwide; 

cost of labor, labor shortages, and other changes in labor conditions; 

the potential for nationalization of enterprises; 

potential limitations on the Company s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies, including protection of intellectual property; 

difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; 

potentially adverse tax consequences, including limitations on repatriations of earnings; and 

difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis. 

The implementation of tariffs could increase the cost of certain commodities and/or limit their supply. Over the longer term, tariffs could significantly increase our costs and our ability to pass such increased costs along to our customers may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 We are subject to and must comply with U.S. laws restricting or otherwise prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries and with certain parties, including those on exports imposed under the U.S. Export Control Laws and Sanctions Programs. These laws and regulations change from time to time and may restrict sales to other countries or parties. 
 We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper business advantage. We operate in many parts of the world and sell to industries that have experienced corruption to some degree. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other similar anti-bribery law or regulatory violations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Also, a material disruption to the financial institutions with whom we transact business could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Changes in the estimates of fair value of reporting units or of long-lived assets, particularly goodwill, may result in future impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 806,643 of goodwill, representing approximately 18 of our total assets. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Future goodwill impairment charges may occur if estimates of fair values decrease, which would reduce future earnings. In addition, we may incur asset impairment charges if asset utilization declines, if customer demand decreases, or for a number of other reasons, which would reduce future earnings. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 13 

There can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions of the fair value of our reporting units, the current economic environment, or the other inputs used in forecasting the present value of forecasted cash flows used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units will prove to be accurate projections of future performance, and any material error in our estimates and assumptions, could result in us needing to take a material impairment charge, which would have the effects discussed above. 
 Our inability to retain key personnel or attract and retain new qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to operate successfully. 
 Due to the specialized nature of our business, competition for technical personnel is intense and our future performance is highly dependent on our ability to hire, train, assimilate, and retain a qualified workforce. Additionally, it is important we hire and retain personnel with relevant experience in local laws, regulations, customs, traditions, and business practices to support our international operations. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, increasing local and global competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees, challenges associated with retaining qualified employees, restructuring and alignment activities, and the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs. 
 Our financial and operating performance depends on continued access to a stable workforce and on favorable labor relations with our employees. 
 We rely on a highly trained workforce due to the specialized nature of our business. Further, approximately 13 of our workforce in the United States is unionized, and certain of our operations in the United States and internationally involve different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils. We periodically need to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, and any failure to negotiate new agreements or extensions in a timely manner could result in work stoppages or slowdowns. Any significant increases in labor costs, deterioration of employee relations, including any conflicts with works councils or unions, or slowdowns or work stoppages at any of our locations, whether due to employee turnover, changes in availability of qualified technical personnel, failure to have a collaborative and effective relationship with our employees, including our union employees, or an effective collective bargaining agreement in place with our union employees, or otherwise, could impair our ability to supply products or fulfill orders, and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, our relationships with customers, and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Further increases in labor costs could significantly reduce our profit margins if we are unable to flow such costs through to our customers. 
 Our operations and suppliers may be subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt our operations. 
 Our operations and sources of supply could be disrupted by unforeseen events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and other forms of severe weather in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located, any of which could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, public health concerns and pandemics, war, political unrest, terrorist activity, equipment failures, power outages, threats to physical security of our facilities, assets or people, or the security of our information technology ("IT") infrastructure and systems or other unforeseen events could result in physical damage to or other disruption of, and complete or partial closure of, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, or could cause temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products and significant delays in the shipment of products and the provision of services, which could in turn cause the loss of sales and customers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all the costs that may arise from such events. Accordingly, disruption of our operations or the operations of a significant supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Failure to develop, obtain, enforce, and protect intellectual property rights or third parties claims that we are infringing their intellectual property could harm our business. 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to develop technologies and inventions and other intellectual property, and obtain intellectual property rights and enforce such intellectual property rights worldwide. In this regard, we rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we do business, as well as license agreements, nondisclosure agreements, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions. 
 However, we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights in our new technologies and inventions or, if we do, the scope of such rights may not be sufficiently broad to afford us any significant commercial advantage over our competitors. Further, our existing and future intellectual property rights may not provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. The technologies 
 14 

and inventions developed by us in the future may not be considered valuable by customers or provide us with a competitive advantage, or competitors may develop similar or identical technologies and inventions independently of us and before we do. 
 Effective protection of intellectual property rights is expensive and difficult to maintain, both in terms of application and maintenance costs, as well as the costs of defending and enforcing those rights. Competitors and other third parties may also challenge the ownership, validity, and/or enforceability of our patents or other intellectual property rights. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. To the extent we do assert our intellectual property rights against third parties, we may not be successful and adequate remedies may not be available in the event of infringement or unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, or disclosure of our trade secrets. 
 Third parties may in the future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our current or future technologies are not, infringing or violating intellectual property rights of third parties, or will not do so in the future. In the event we face claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may face expensive litigation or indemnification obligations, be required to enter into licenses, and may be prevented from selling existing products and pursuing product development or commercialization. Even if such claims are without merit, we may be required to expend significant time and resources on the defense of such claims. If we are unable to sufficiently protect our patent and other proprietary rights or if we infringe on or misappropriate proprietary rights of others, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
 We are subject to legal proceedings, investigations, claims and/or regulatory proceedings which could have a significant impact on our business and operations. 
 We are currently involved or may become involved in legal, regulatory, and other proceedings. These proceedings may include, without limitation, product liability matters, intellectual property matters, contract disputes or claims, pending or threatened litigation, governmental investigations, as well as employment, tax, environmental, or other matters. These proceedings could lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, business remedies, or the assertion of private litigation claims and/or damages that could be material, and of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Even if the legal proceedings we face are decided in our favor, or are unfounded, we may incur material expenses and such matters may require significant management attention, and may harm our reputation with customers, employees or investors. We accrue for known individual matters if we believe it is probable that the matter will result in a loss when ultimately resolved using estimates of the most likely amount of loss. However, estimating possible losses involves significant judgment and outcomes are unpredictable, therefore, actual losses may exceed our estimates. 
 Our business and operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other information technology system or network interruptions or intrusions. 
 We depend heavily on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our IT and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data, including proprietary business information, intellectual property, classified information, customer information, supplier information, and confidential employee or other personal data on our servers and databases. Also, due to political uncertainty and hostile military actions, we may be subject to heightened risks of cybersecurity incidents and security breaches initiated by nation-state or affiliated actors. 
 From time to time, we have experienced cyberattacks on our IT infrastructure and systems. We may become the target of cyber-attacks by third parties, either directly or indirectly via our supply chain or third-party vendors, seeking unauthorized access to our data or our customers data or to disrupt our operations or our ability to provide services. There is also a danger of loss, misuse, theft, unavailability, or unauthorized disclosure or other processing of information or assets (including source code), or damage to or other compromise of systems, components, and other IT assets, including the introduction of malicious code or other vulnerabilities by people who obtain unauthorized access to our facilities, systems, or information. There are many different techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems and data, and such techniques continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, and the adversaries are becoming more advanced, including nation states and actors sponsored by or affiliated with nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect national security information, and other actors with substantial financial and technological resources. These techniques include, but are not limited to, the use of malicious software, destructive malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, phishing and other means of social engineering, and other means of causing system or network disruptions, obtaining unauthorized access to data or systems, or causing other cybersecurity breaches and 
 15 

incidents. Additionally, system and service disruptions, and cybersecurity breaches or incidents, may result from employee or contractor error, negligence, or malfeasance. Further, there have been and may continue to be cyberattacks on, and other attempts to compromise the security of, the supply chain. We may experience security breaches or incidents resulting from tools, services, or other third-party components and security vulnerabilities within, or introduced by, such tools, services, or components. Due to the rapidly evolving threat environment and other factors, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Further, due to the evolving nature of these security threats and the national security aspects of much of the data we protect, the full impact of any future security breach or incident cannot be predicted. 
 We have implemented various measures, including technical security controls, employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, independent third party security assessments, maintenance of backup systems, and the use of disaster recovery sites. In addition, we have, among other things, endeavored to align our practices and procedures with recognized IT security frameworks and select recommended practices, and through corroboration of our policies and procedures with local and federal agencies. Nonetheless, our IT infrastructure, systems, networks, products, solutions, and services remain potentially vulnerable to numerous additional known or unknown threats. Although we have implemented measures to prevent, detect, and respond to malicious activity, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective or sufficient to prevent a cyberattack or other means of effecting cybersecurity breaches or incidents. 
 If any of our IT infrastructure or systems are damaged, disrupted, or are otherwise impacted by security breaches or incidents, whether from cybersecurity attacks or other causes, or if we suffer any security breach or incident involving unauthorized access to, misuse, acquisition, disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction of our data or other data we maintain or otherwise process, we could experience significant operational stoppages, disruptions, delays, and/or other detrimental impacts on our operations or investment in research, and may face increased costs, including increased costs of implementing new data protection and security measures, policies, and procedures, and costs associated with remediating and otherwise responding to the security breach or incident. Any such security breach or incident or the perception that it has occurred, also may result reputational damage and increased operational costs, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and orders, litigation or other demands, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, fines or penalties relating to actual or alleged violation of applicable laws, regulations, or contractual obligations, incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships, and other costs and liabilities. Such impacts could result in diminished competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, any unauthorized disclosure or use or acquisition of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of intellectual property protection, and otherwise reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. 
 Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate for all liability relating to any actual or potential disruption or other security breach or incident. We cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation. 
 Data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity may require significant resources and present certain risks. 
 We collect, store, and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including personal data and other information that is subject to laws, regulations, customer-imposed controls, or other actual or asserted obligations. The laws, regulations, standards, and other actual and asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity to which we may be subject, in the U.S. and globally, are evolving. For example, in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation imposes stringent requirements applicable to processing personal data and provides for substantial penalties for noncompliance, and in the U.S., California and numerous other states have adopted comprehensive privacy laws, with other states considering such laws. Many jurisdictions around the world have passed or are considering laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity, including laws that impose cross-border data transfer restrictions and require certain personal data to be maintained on local servers. 
 Any actual or perceived failure to comply with laws, regulations, or contractual or other actual or asserted obligations to which we are or are alleged to be subject relating to privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity could result in claims, litigation, and regulatory investigations and other proceedings, as well as damage to our reputation. These could result in substantial costs, diversion of resources, fines, penalties, and other damages and liabilities, and harm to our customer 
 16 

relationships, our market position, and our ability to attract new customer engagements. Any of these could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, potentially in a material manner. 
 Increasing emission standards that drive certain product sales may be eased or delayed, which could reduce our competitive advantage. 
 We sell components and systems that have been designed to meet strict emission standards, including standards that have not yet been implemented but are expected to be implemented soon. If these emission standards are eased, developed products may become unnecessary and/or our future sales could be lower as potential customers select alternative products or delay adoption of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Prices for fossil fuels may increase significantly and disproportionately to other sources of fuels used for power generation, which could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Commercial producers of electricity use many of our components and systems, most predominately in their power plants that use natural gas as their fuel source. Commercial producers of electricity are often in a position to manage the use of different power plant facilities and make decisions based on operating costs. Compared to other sources of fuels used for power generation, natural gas prices have increased slower than fuel oil, but about the same as coal. This increase in natural gas prices and any future increases, whether in absolute dollars or relative to other fuel costs such as oil, could impact the sales mix of our components and systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Long-term reduced commodity prices for oil, natural gas, and other minerals may depress the markets for certain of our products and services, particularly those from our Industrial segment. 
 Many of our Industrial segment OEM and aftermarket customers and our Aerospace segment rotorcraft product lines customers provide goods and services that support various industrial extraction activities, including mining, oil and gas exploration and extraction, and transportation of raw materials from extraction sites to refineries and/or processing facilities. Long-term lower prices for commodities such as oil, natural gas, gold, tin, and various other minerals could reduce exploration activities and place downward pressure on demand for our goods and services that support exploration and extraction activities. 
 Business Risks 
 Our product development activities may not be successful, may be more costly than anticipated, or we may not be able to produce newly developed products at a cost that meets the anticipated product cost structure. 
 Our business involves a significant level of product development activities, generally in connection with our customers development activities. Industry standards, customer expectations, or other products may emerge that could render one or more of our products or services less desirable or obsolete. Additionally, our competitors may develop new technology, or more efficient ways to produce their existing products that could cause our existing products or services to become less desirable or obsolete. Maintaining our market position requires continued investment in research and development. During an economic downturn or a subsequent recovery, we may need to maintain our investment in research and development, which may limit our ability to reduce these expenses in proportion to a sales shortfall. 
 In addition, increased investments in research and development may divert resources from other potential investments in our business, such as acquisitions or investments in our facilities, processes, and operations. If these activities are not as successful as currently anticipated, are not completed on a timely basis, or are more costly than currently anticipated, or if we are not able to produce newly developed products at a cost that meets the anticipated product cost structure, then our future sales, margins and/or earnings could be lower than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Product liability claims, product recalls or other liabilities associated with the products and services we provide may force us to pay substantial damage awards and other expenses. 
 The manufacture and sale of our products and the services we provide expose us to risks of product and other tort claims, and any resulting liability. We currently have and have had in the past product liability claims relating to our products, and we will likely be subject to additional product liability claims in the future for past, current, and future products. Some of these claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of 
 17 

operations, and cash flows. We also provide certain services to our customers and are subject to claims with respect to the services provided. In providing such services, we may rely on subcontractors to perform all or a portion of the contracted services. It is possible that we could be liable to our customers for work performed by a subcontractor. 
 Regardless of the outcome, product liability claims can be expensive to defend, can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, and can cause reputational damage. While we believe that we have appropriate insurance coverage available to us related to any such claims, our insurance may not cover all liabilities or be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. An unsuccessful result in connection with a product liability claim, where the liabilities are not covered by insurance or for which indemnification or other recovery is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, and other transactions we enter into could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing operations, result in operating difficulties, harm our business, and negatively impact our results of operations. 
 As part of our business strategy, we have pursued, and expect to pursue acquisitions of other companies and assets. The identification, evaluation, and negotiation of potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions may divert the attention of management and entail various expenses, whether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. If we are able to complete a transaction. The success of these transactions depends on, among other things, our ability to integrate these businesses into our operations and realize the planned synergies. Integration of acquired operations may take longer, or be more costly or disruptive to our business, than originally anticipated. The integration of these acquisitions may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management s attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. We may also incur costs and divert management attention to acquisitions that are never consummated. 
 Difficulties in the integration of the acquired business may include consolidating the operations, processes, and systems of the acquired business, retaining and motivating key management and employees, and integrating existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Even if integration is successful, the financial and operational results may differ materially from our assumptions and forecasts due to unforeseen expenses, delays, conditions, and liabilities. Evolving regulations such as changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll, or pension policies could increase the expected costs of acquisitions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may impact the agreed upon purchase price. In addition, we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following an acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, and other liabilities. 
 Many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management s time and attention. Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. We may experience difficulty separating out portions of, or entire, businesses, incur loss of revenue or experience negative impact on margins, or we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits. In addition, these types of transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction, or we may remain liable for certain matters. We are not likely to have the same level of control over the divested business, and the performance of those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Our restructuring activities may reduce our profitability, and may not have the intended effects. 
 From time to time, we have implemented restructuring and other actions designed to reduce structural costs, improve operational efficiency, and position the Company for long-term profitable growth. Historically, our restructuring activities have included workforce management and other restructuring charges related to acquired businesses. Further, we may decide to implement restructuring or alignment activities in the future, which may involve, among other things, closing plants, moving production lines, or making additions, reductions, or other changes to our management or workforce. These restructuring and/or alignment activities generally result in charges and expenditures that may adversely affect our financial results for one or more periods. 
 18 

Restructuring and/or alignment activities can also create unanticipated consequences, such as instability or distraction among our workforce, and we cannot be sure that any restructuring or alignment efforts that we undertake will be successful. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize expected cost savings, including, among others, higher than expected severance costs related to staff reductions, higher than expected costs of closing plants, higher costs to hire new employees or delays or difficulty hiring the employees needed, higher than expected operating costs associated with moving production lines, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost-saving plan, and other unexpected costs associated with operating the business. 
 If we are unable to structure our operations in the light of evolving market conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Our manufacturing activities may result in future environmental costs or liabilities. 
 We use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing operations. We also own, operate, have acquired, and may in the future acquire facilities that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials. We are subject to a substantial number of costly regulations and we must conform our operations to applicable regulatory requirements in all countries in which we operate. The risk that a significant release of regulated materials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will not incur additional material costs or liabilities as a result of complying with these requirements. 
 In addition, we may be subject to other environmental remediation costs such as participation in superfund sites or other similar jurisdictional initiatives. As a result, we may incur material costs or liabilities or be required to undertake future environmental remediation activities that could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Failure of our production lines, or those of our subcontractors, to meet required certification standards could disrupt production. 
 Our existing production lines, as well as the production lines of our subcontractors, are sometimes required to pass varying levels of qualification with certain of our customers. Some of our customers require that our production lines pass their specific qualification standards and that we, and any subcontractors that we may use, be registered under or certified to certain U.S. or international quality standards. We may be unable to obtain, maintain, or we may experience delays in obtaining, a certification or registration to a required quality standard. A delay in obtaining, or the failure to obtain a necessary quality certification or registration could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Item 1B. Unresolve d Staff Comments 
 None. 
 Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy 
 We maintain a cybersecurity risk management program based upon the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity framework to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks. This program is designed to protect business continuity and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of our IT systems and infrastructure used in our business as well as the information that we own or is in our care, and is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program. 
 We have established processes to evaluate and address cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis. As part of our risk management program, we engage with external third parties to measure the effectiveness of our cybersecurity program through penetration tests, control assessments, tabletop exercises, and other related activities. Further, we have implemented a defense-in-depth strategy in which we utilize real-time 24/7 monitoring to identify anomalies, potential threats, and alerts. This cybersecurity strategy incorporates frameworks, policies, and practices designed to protect the privacy and security of our sensitive information, backed by a suite of security technologies and tools to implement and automate select security protections. We maintain cyber risk and related insurance policies as a measure of added protection. 
 We educate our members to raise awareness of cybersecurity threats. As part of our program, we maintain annual training for all members on cybersecurity standards and provide training on how to recognize and properly respond to 
 19 

phishing, social engineering schemes, and certain other cyber threats. We equip our members with a mechanism to easily report suspicious emails which are analyzed by our security systems and dedicated incident response team. Test phishing assessments are periodically sent to our members. Any failures trigger a retraining exercise if not properly reported. Also, we have specific and regular training for our IT and finance members, as well as our system administrators. 
 In addition, we maintain processes governing interconnections with third-party systems and we perform due diligence procedures before onboarding service providers with access to our systems or processing sensitive data on our behalf. This process includes a review of System and Organization Controls ("SOC") 1 and SOC 2 reports (as each such report is defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants), ISO 27001 certifications, and Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certifications ("CMMC"), as well as reviewing penetration tests, conducting vulnerability tests, and administering security questionnaires and assessments. 
 We are not aware of having experienced risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, risks from cybersecurity threats, including but not limited to exploitation of vulnerabilities, ransomware, denial of service, supply chain attacks, or other similar threats may materially affect us, including our execution of business strategy, reputation, results of operations and/or financial condition. Nonetheless, our IT infrastructure, systems, networks, products, solutions, and services remain potentially vulnerable to numerous additional known or unknown threats. For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor entitled Our business and operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other information technology system or network interruptions or intrusions. 
 Cybersecurity Governance 
 Our cybersecurity program is ultimately overseen by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has responsibility for the oversight of risk management activities related to cybersecurity and other information security and technology risks. Our cybersecurity program is implemented and administered by a dedicated team of internal and external cybersecurity professionals that conduct periodic control gap assessments, maturity assessments, and benchmarking against peers in the industry. The team has decades of experience with varied certifications and is led by our Chief Information Officer ("CISO"), who has over 17 years of experience as an IT professional and in cybersecurity and reports to our Vice President of IT. The CISO makes regular reports to senior management regarding the cybersecurity program. We also have a notification process for appropriate escalation of cyber incidents by members of our internal cybersecurity team to senior management as appropriate, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and/or General Counsel, as well as to the Audit Committee. Management provides quarterly data protection and cybersecurity reports to the Audit Committee, as well as periodic reports to the full Board of Directors, which include information about cyber risk management, the cybersecurity risk environment, and the status of ongoing efforts to strengthen cybersecurity effectiveness.

Dollar and number of share amounts contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are in thousands, except per share amounts. For a discussion of the 2023 Results of Operations, including a discussion of the financial results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 17, 2023. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We enhance the global quality of life and sustainability by optimizing energy use through improved efficiency and lower emissions. We are an independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of control solutions for the aerospace and industrial markets. We design, produce, and service reliable, efficient, low-emission, and high-performance energy control products for diverse applications in challenging environments. We have production and assembly facilities primarily in the United States, Europe, and Asia, and promote our products and services through our worldwide locations. 
 Our strategic focus is providing energy control and optimization solutions for the aerospace and industrial markets. The precise and efficient control of energy, including motion, fluid, combustion, and electrical energy, is a growing requirement in the markets we serve, and we have developed and are executing on strategies to leverage the macro trends of reducing greenhouse gases, commercializing space, and accelerating the digital age. To facilitate a cleaner world, we are partnering with our customers to enable their equipment to be more efficient, capable of utilizing clean burning fuels, advancing fuel cells, and the integration of renewable power in both commercial and defense operations. Our core technologies can be leveraged across our markets and customer applications, enabling us to develop and integrate cost-effective and state-of-the-art fuel, combustion, fluid, actuation, and electronic systems. We focus primarily on serving OEMs and equipment packagers, partnering with them to bring superior component and system solutions to their demanding applications. We also provide aftermarket repair, maintenance, replacement, and other service support for our installed products. 
 Our components and integrated systems optimize performance of commercial aircraft, defense aircraft, military ground vehicles and other equipment, gas and steam turbines, industrial diesel, gas, bio-diesel and dual-fuel reciprocating engines, and electrical power systems. Our innovative motion, fluid, combustion, and electrical energy control systems help our customers offer more cost-effective, cleaner, and more reliable equipment. 
 Global Business Conditions 
 During fiscal year 2024, we saw significant sales growth and margin expansion. The compounding impacts of our focused efforts on operational excellence enabled us to increase output and capitalize on continued strong end market demand for our products and services across the aerospace and industrial markets. We continue to better align price to the value of our products which helps to mitigate the ongoing impacts of inflation. 
 We continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment as inflation, economic uncertainty, and supply chain challenges continue to impact certain aspects of our business. We remain committed to growth, operational excellence, and innovation to deliver long-term success and enhanced shareholder value. We are unable to predict the full extent to which macroeconomic factors will continue to adversely impact our business, including our operational performance, results of operations, cash flows, financial position, and the achievement of our strategic objectives. Such uncertainty may affect our ability to accurately predict our future performance and forecast our financial results. 
 BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS 
 We serve the aerospace and industrial markets. 
 Aerospace Markets 
 Our aerospace products and systems are primarily used to provide propulsion, actuation, and motion control in both commercial and defense fixed-wing aircraft, rotorcraft, smart defense, and other defense systems. 
 Commercial and Civil Aircraft The commercial aerospace markets experienced robust demand in fiscal year 2024 as a result of continued global air traffic growth. In response, aircraft operators are taking delivery of the newest generation aircraft models to meet the growing demand, replace aging aircraft, achieve greater fuel efficiency, and lower emissions. The delivery of the newest generation of aircraft is expected to favor our product offerings because we have more content on those aircraft. We expect production levels to continue to grow due to strong OEM order backlogs for the new aircraft models and continued demand supply imbalance. Demand in the widebody aviation market improved in fiscal year 2024 
 24 

compared to recent years due to increasing production rates on the A350, A330neo, Boeing 787, and 777. We expect narrowbody deliveries to improve due to backlog associated with single aisle programs and planned production ramps in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024. 
 We have content on the Airbus A220, A320neo, A330neo, Bell 429, Boeing 737 MAX, 777, 787, and Comac C919. We have been awarded content on the 777-9 and a variety of business jet platforms, among others. 
 We continue to explore opportunities on new engine and aircraft programs that are under consideration or have been recently announced and have been selected to provide rotary actuation solutions for the NASA and Boeing Transonic Truss-braced Wing (TTBW) X-66A aircraft demonstrator, which is testing a concept to reduce fuel burn for the next single aisle aircraft designs. 
 With the full return to service of the 737 MAX aircraft and increasing deliveries, initial provisioning sales related to the aircraft and the CFM LEAP engine accelerated during the first half of fiscal year 2024. 
 In February 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration FAA required a quality production plan from Boeing in response to several aircraft issues. As part of this quality production plan, the FAA is exercising enhanced oversight of Boeing, including a requirement that the FAA have approval authority for build rate increases on the 737 MAX. During fiscal year 2024, overall 737 MAX orders and demand have not changed significantly. In fiscal year 2024, the enhanced FAA oversight had a slightly negative impact on commercial OEM sales, but this was offset by price realization. In the event the FAA approves increases to Boeing's build rates, we anticipate initial provisioning sales would continue to increase in subsequent periods. In November 2024, Boeing's U.S. West Coast factory workers accepted a new contract offer, ending a seven-week strike that halted production of the 737 MAX as well as the 777. As a result of the work stoppage, our direct sales in fiscal year 2025 to Boeing have been negatively impacted. However, now that the strike has ended we expect that deliveries of the 737 MAX program will continue to increase in future periods and that the long-term demand for the aircraft has not changed. However, a prolonged depression of build rates of the Boeing 737 MAX could decrease our OEM and initial provisioning sales for the 737 MAX and CFM LEAP engines in the near term, which could have an adverse effect on our business results. 
 Defense In recent years, the defense industry has been strong as budgetary allocations have generally increased since 2016. Ongoing global conflicts and preparation for near-peer threats are leading to higher global defense budgets. The U.S. National Defense Authorization Act ("NDAA") for fiscal year 2024 resulted in higher levels of funding for procurement, research and development, and maintenance, which supported our growth for fiscal year 2024. We expect defense research and development, procurement, and maintenance to increase in future years, which would be beneficial for us for future opportunities in defense markets. Our involvement with a wide variety of defense programs in fixed-wing aircraft, rotorcraft, and weapons systems has provided relative stability for our defense market sales, as some newer programs increase (e.g., F-35 Lightning II and T-7A Trainer), and some legacy programs decrease (e.g., F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet and V-22 Osprey). Other programs are relatively steady (e.g., KC-46A Tanker, UH-60 Black Hawk, and A-64 Apache helicopter programs) and some legacy programs, such as the F-15, should maintain or potentially increase production. Smart defense programs for which we have sales include the Joint Direct Attack Munition JDAM ), Small Diameter Bomb SDB ), and AIM-9X smart defense systems. During fiscal year 2024, we experienced significant growth in smart defense programs following multiple years of decline. We expect overall demand to increase in the near term for these weapons programs. 
 Aftermarket Our commercial aftermarket business increased significantly in fiscal year 2024, as global air traffic continued to grow and initial provisioning sales have increased. In addition, our products have been selected for new aerospace platforms and our content has increased across existing platforms, which drives increased aftermarket sales. With the entry into service of single aisle aircraft (Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo), we have seen a significant increase in initial provisioning sales to the operators of these new aircraft. As aircraft production levels increase to accommodate rising passenger demand and to mitigate higher operating costs driven largely by higher fuel costs on older and less fuel-efficient aircraft, we expect airlines will retire older generation aircraft as they reach certain age thresholds (typically between twenty and twenty-five years). However, in the past few years, aircraft retirements have lagged historical levels because passenger demand has outpaced deliveries of the newest generation aircraft, forcing airlines to keep older generation legacy aircraft in service longer than anticipated. This has led to increased demand for repairs and spare parts for older engine programs remaining in service, consistent with air traffic growth. This dynamic applies to commercial aftermarket related to repairs and spare parts for mature legacy programs with large in-service fleets, such as the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 777. 
 Our defense aftermarket sales also increased significantly during fiscal year 2024 due to increased defense budgets resulting in operations and maintenance upgrades. Global conflicts and growing international demand for various other 
 25 

military programs continue to drive demand for operations of defense aircraft, including fighter jets, transports and both utility and attack rotorcraft, which are all supported by our products and systems. Although we expect variability, which is generally attributable to the cycling of various maintenance and upgrade programs, as well as actual usage, our outlook for the defense aftermarket is strong. This is due primarily to growing fleets, the service lives of existing military programs being extended, and increased demand for repairs and spare parts for older military aircraft programs remaining in service. 
 Industrial Markets 
 Our industrial products are used worldwide in various types of turbine and reciprocating engine-powered equipment, including electric power generation and distribution systems, ships, locomotives, compressors, pumps, and other mobile and industrial machines. 
 Power Generation The demand for power generation, which consists mainly of heavy frame, aero derivative, and small industrial gas turbines, increased in fiscal year 2024 due to increased demand from power generation and process industries, particularly in North America, the Middle East, Asia, and more broadly in support of fixed generation capacity to backstop the growing renewable energy installed base. Start reliability, fuel flexibility, safety, and part-load efficiency are all key drivers of the power generation market as the conversion from coal to natural gas usage continues, and we believe we continue to be well positioned to meet these market needs on the existing and next generation turbines. We project continued growth as demand for electricity is expected to increase through global electrification and growing power consumption for data center applications. This overall global demand will primarily be met through a balance of renewable power sources and newer industrial gas turbines for which we have been awarded increased content. 
 Transportation Our key markets for transportation include compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas trucks in Asia, mining, and commercial and defense marine markets. While full year sales in our on-highway natural gas truck business in China increased significantly as compared to fiscal year 2023, we saw a material decline in this business from the first half of fiscal year 2024 to the second half due to the deteriorating Chinese economy, a narrower natural gas to diesel spread, and elevated customer inventory levels. In fiscal year 2025, we expect a decline in demand in our on-highway natural gas trucks business in China as compared to fiscal year 2024, and future demand remains uncertain due to the volatility of this business. In global marine markets, demand in fiscal year 2024 increased due to increased ship build rates and higher ship utilization, driving current and future aftermarket activity. Both commercial and defense marine customers continue to launch additional projects to support new programs or modernize fleets, including incorporating alternative fuels capability, which should drive expanded OEM and service opportunities, as multi-fuel engines contain more of our content. 
 Oil and Gas During fiscal year 2024, we experienced decreased demand due to decreased domestic rig counts and the decrease in global oil and gas prices. We expect market share gains by our customers and increased scope on the next generation reciprocating engines as energy policies in some countries encourage the use of compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and other alternative fuels over carbon-rich petroleum fuels, which we expect will drive increased demand for our alternative fuel clean engine control technologies. Additionally, due to increased demand for fuel flexibility as well as natural gas price variability and global supply chain disruptions, power plant operations have transitioned to higher dual fuel use, thereby increasing the demand for our liquid fuel system and related products.

 Liquidity Highlights 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2024 was 439,089, compared to 308,543 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is primarily attributable to increased earnings and improved working capital. 
 For fiscal year 2024, free cash flow was 342,809, compared to 232,043 for fiscal year 2023. We define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less payments for property, plant, and equipment. The increase in free cash flow for fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increased earnings and improved working capital, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. 
 At September 30, 2024, we held 282,270 in cash and cash equivalents and had total outstanding debt of 872,470 with additional borrowing availability of 775,136, net of outstanding letters of credit, under our revolving credit agreement. At September 30, 2024, we also had additional borrowing capacity of 19,771 under various foreign lines of credit and foreign overdraft facilities.

Consolidated net sales for the year ended September 30, 2024 

3,324,249 

In the Aerospace segment, the increase in net sales for fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily attributable to price realization, as well as increases in both commercial and defense aftermarket due to higher aircraft utilization. 
 In the Industrial segment, the increase in net sales for fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily attributable to growth in transportation, particularly in the on-highway natural gas truck business in China, price realization, and strong sales in power generation, partially offset by a decrease in oil and gas sales. 
 2024 Costs and Expenses Compared to 2023 
 Cost of goods sold increased by 210,787 to 2,447,770 for fiscal year 2024, from 2,236,983 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in cost of goods sold on an absolute basis in fiscal year 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher sales volume and net inflationary impacts on material and labor costs. 
 Gross margin (as measured by net sales less cost of goods sold, divided by net sales) was 26.4 for fiscal year 2024, compared to 23.2 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in gross margin for fiscal year 2024 is primarily attributable to price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by net inflationary impacts on material and labor. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 37,807, or 14.0 , to 307,499 for fiscal year 2024, compared to 269,692 for fiscal year 2023. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were flat at 9.3 for fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses on an 
 28 

absolute basis for fiscal year 2024 as compared to prior fiscal year is primarily due to increased members, increased annual variable incentive compensation costs, and increased expenses relating to business development activities. 
 Research and development costs increased by 8,581, or 6.5 , to 140,676 for fiscal year 2024, as compared to 132,095 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in research and development costs on an absolute basis for fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily due to variability in the timing of projects and expenses. Research and development costs as a percentage of net sales decreased to 4.2 for fiscal year 2024, as compared to 4.5 for fiscal year 2023. The decrease in research and development costs as a percentage of net sales for fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily due to net sales increases in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. Our research and development activities extend across both our operating segments and almost all of our customer base, and we anticipate ongoing variability in research and development costs due to the timing of customer business needs on current and future programs. 
 Interest expense remained flat at 47,959, or 1.4 of net sales for fiscal year 2024, compared to 47,898 or 1.6 of net sales for fiscal year 2023. Interest expense remained flat for fiscal year 2024 primarily due to consistent borrowings and interest rates on our revolving credit agreement as compared to the prior fiscal year. 
 Other income, net was 67,168 for fiscal year 2024, compared to 50,291 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in other income in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily attributable to increased earnings of the JV and a non-recurring gain related to a previous acquisition that was recognized during the current fiscal year. 
 Income taxes were provided at an effective rate on earnings before income taxes of 17.8 for fiscal year 2024, compared to 15.7 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is primarily attributable to a smaller research and development credit, smaller net excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation as a percent of current year earnings, fewer resolutions of tax items with taxing authorities, and increased return to provision items, partially offset by smaller current fiscal year projected future withholding taxes on unremitted earnings.

2024 Segment Results Compared to 2023 
 Aerospace 
 Aerospace segment net sales increased by 260,515, or 14.7 to 2,028,618 for fiscal year 2024, compared to 1,768,103 for fiscal year 2023. Segment net sales increased for fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023 primarily due to price realization and increases in both commercial and defense aftermarket volumes due to higher aircraft utilization. 
 Defense OEM sales increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to prior fiscal year, primarily driven by the increased demand for smart defense. Our defense aftermarket sales increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by increased output and supply chain stabilization. 
 Aerospace segment earnings increased by 95,256, or 32.8 , to 385,360 for fiscal year 2024, compared to 290,104 for fiscal year 2023. 
 The net increase in Aerospace segment earnings for fiscal year 2024 was due to the following:

Aerospace segment earnings as a percentage of segment net sales were 19.0 for fiscal year 2024 and 16.4 for fiscal year 2023. 
 Industrial 
 Industrial segment net sales increased by 149,168, or 13.0 , to 1,295,631 for fiscal year 2024, compared to 1,146,463 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in Industrial segment net sales in fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to growth in transportation, particularly in the on-highway natural gas truck business in China, price realization, and strong sales in power generation, partially offset by a decrease in oil and gas sales. 
 Industrial segment earnings increased by 68,235, or 42.2 , to 229,857 for fiscal year 2024, compared to 161,622 for fiscal year 2023. 
 The net increase in Industrial segment earnings for fiscal year 2024 was due to the following:

Other, net 

(21,243) 

Earnings for the period ended September 30, 2024 

229,857 

Industrial segment earnings as a percentage of segment net sales were 17.7 for fiscal year 2024, compared to 14.1 for fiscal year 2023. Industrial earnings in fiscal year 2024 benefited significantly from increases in transportation due to increased demand for on-highway natural gas trucks in China, as well as operational improvements including increased output and other efficiency gains. 
 We expect significant sales and earnings decreases in our China on-highway natural gas truck business in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024 due to the deteriorating local Chinese economy, a narrower natural gas to diesel spread, and elevated customer inventory levels. Future demand remains uncertain due to the volatility of this business. 
 Nonsegment 
 Nonsegment expenses decreased by 11,066 to 119,745 for fiscal year 2024, compared to 130,811 for fiscal year 2023. The decrease in nonsegment expenses is primarily due to significant costs that occurred in fiscal year 2023 that did not reoccur in fiscal year 2024. 
 30 

The significant costs that impacted nonsegment expense are as follows: 

Year Ended September 30, 

2024

Excluding these charges in the above table, nonsegment expenses increased 15,667 in fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased annual variable incentive compensation costs. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Historically, we have satisfied our working capital needs, as well as capital expenditures, product development and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations, with cash flow provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facilities. We have also issued debt to supplement our cash needs, repay our other indebtedness, or finance our acquisitions. We expect that cash generated from our operating activities, together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to fund our continuing operating needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. 
 Our total cash and cash equivalents were 282,270 at September 30, 2024 and 137,447 at September 30, 2023, and our working capital was 820,101 at September 30, 2024 and 852,256 at September 30, 2023. Of the cash and cash equivalents held at September 30, 2024, 279,070 was held by our foreign locations. We are not presently aware of any significant restrictions on the repatriation of these funds, although a portion is considered indefinitely reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed to fund our operations or satisfy obligations in the United States, then they could be repatriated and their repatriation into the United States may cause us to incur additional U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes. Any additional U.S. taxes could be offset, in part or in whole, by foreign tax credits. The amount of such taxes and application of tax credits would be dependent on the income tax laws and other circumstances at the time these amounts are repatriated. Based on these variables, it is impractical to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these funds were to be repatriated. 
 Our revolving credit facility, as amended, provides a borrowing capacity of up to 1,000,000 with the option to increase total available borrowings to up to 1,500,000, subject to lenders participation. We can borrow against our revolving credit facility as long as we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We believe we were in compliance with all our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility can be made in U.S. dollars or in foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar provided that the U.S. dollar equivalent of any foreign currency borrowings and U.S. dollar borrowings does not, in total, exceed the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility. Historically, we have used borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to meet certain short-term working capital needs, as well as for strategic uses, including repurchases of our common stock, payments of dividends, acquisitions, and facility expansions. 
 In addition to our revolving credit facility, we have various foreign credit facilities, some of which are tied to net amounts on deposit at certain foreign financial institutions. These foreign credit facilities are reviewed annually for renewal. We use borrowings under these foreign credit facilities to finance certain local operations on a periodic basis. For further discussion of our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities, see Note 15, Credit facilities, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had total outstanding debt of 872,470 consisting of various series of unsecured notes due between 2025 and 2033, and amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility, and our finance leases. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had additional borrowing availability of 775,136 under our revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, and additional borrowing availability of 19,771 under various foreign credit facilities. 
 31 

At September 30, 2024, we had 217,000 outstanding amount borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Revolving credit facility and short-term borrowing activity during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:

We believe we were in compliance with all our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. See Note 15, Credit facilities, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, for more information about our covenants. 
 Our ability to service our long-term debt, to remain in compliance with the various restrictions and covenants contained in our debt agreements, and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and product development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which in turn is subject to, among other things, future operating performance as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. 
 We believe that cash flows from operations, along with our contractually committed borrowings and other borrowing capability, will continue to be sufficient to fund anticipated capital spending requirements and our operations for the foreseeable future. However, we could be adversely affected if the financial institutions providing our capital requirements refuse to honor their contractual commitments, cease lending, or declare bankruptcy. We believe the lending institutions participating in our credit arrangements are financially stable.

2024 Cash Flows Compared to 2023 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2024 was 439,089, compared to 308,543 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is primarily attributable to increased earnings and improved working capital. 
 Net cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal year 2024 was 89,217, compared to 73,551 in fiscal year 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to increased payments for property, plant, and equipment. 
 Net cash flows used in financing activities for fiscal year 2024 was 218,047, compared to 196,473 in fiscal year 2023. The increase in net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was attributable to the increase in repurchases of common stock partially offset by a change in net debt borrowings as compared to payments. During fiscal year 2024, we made 390,819 of cash repurchases of common stock, compared to 126,380 of cash repurchases of common stock during fiscal year 2023. During fiscal year 2024, we had net debt borrowings in the amount of 141,183, compared to net debt payments in the amount of 67,579 in fiscal year 2023. 
 Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow, are financial measures not prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, we believe these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide additional information that enables readers to evaluate our business from the perspective of management. 
 Earnings based non-U.S. GAAP financial measures 
 Adjusted net earnings is defined by the Company as net earnings excluding, as applicable, (i) a non-recurring gain related to a previous acquisition, (ii) costs related to business development activities, (iii) a non-recurring charge related to 
 32 

a previous acquisition, (iv) certain non-restructuring separation costs, (v) a specific charge for excess and obsolete inventory, (vi) product rationalization, (vii) a non-recurring charge related to customer collections, and (viii) restructuring charges. The product rationalization adjustment pertains to a non-recurring write-off of inventory and assets related to the elimination of certain product lines. The specific charge for excess and obsolete inventory pertains to a non-recurring process change that resulted in the identification and write down of certain excess inventory unrelated to product rationalization. The non-recurring charge related to customer collections pertains to a discrete process issue that was identified and corrected. The Company believes that these excluded items are short-term in nature, not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business and therefore, the exclusion of them illustrates more clearly how the underlying business of Woodward is performing. Management uses adjusted net earnings to evaluate the Company s performance excluding these infrequent or unusual period expenses that are not necessarily indicative of the Company s operating performance for the period. Management defines adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net earnings, as defined above, divided by the weighted-average number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Management uses both adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share when comparing operating performance to other periods which may not have similar infrequent or unusual charges. 
 The reconciliation of net earnings and earnings per share to adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share, respectively, for the fiscal years ended and are shown in the table below:

Management uses EBIT to evaluate our performance without financing and tax related considerations, as these elements may not fluctuate with operating results. Management uses EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance, making business decisions, including developing budgets, managing expenditures, forecasting future periods, and evaluating capital structure impacts of various strategic scenarios. Securities analysts, investors and others frequently use EBIT and EBITDA in their evaluation of companies, particularly those with significant property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization. The Company believes that EBIT and EBITDA are useful measures to the investor when measuring operating performance as they eliminate the impact of financing and tax expenses, which are non-operating expenses and may be driven by factors outside of our operations, such as changes in tax laws or regulations, and, in the case of EBITDA, the noncash charges associated with depreciation and amortization. Further, as interest from financing, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization can vary dramatically between companies and between periods, management believes that the removal of these items can improve comparability. 
 Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA represent further non-U.S. GAAP adjustments to EBIT and EBITDA, in each case adjusted to exclude, as applicable, (i) a non-recurring gain related to a previous acquisition, (ii) costs related to business development activities, (iii) a non-recurring charge related to a previous acquisition, (iv) certain non-restructuring separation costs, (v) a specific charge for excess and obsolete inventory, (vi) product rationalization, (vii) a non-recurring charge related to customer collections, and (viii) restructuring charges. The product rationalization adjustment pertains to a non-recurring write-off of inventory and assets related to the elimination of certain product lines. The specific charge for excess and obsolete inventory pertains to a non-recurring process change that resulted in the identification and write down of certain excess inventory unrelated to product rationalization. The non-recurring charge related to customer collections pertains to a discrete process issue that was identified and corrected. As these charges are infrequent or unusual items that can be variable from period to period and do not fluctuate with operating results, management believes that by removing 
 33 

these gains and charges from EBIT and EBITDA it improves comparability of past, present, and future operating results and provides consistency when comparing EBIT and EBITDA between periods.

The use of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA exclude certain financial information compared with net earnings, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the information that is excluded. Our calculations of adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 Cash flow-based non-U.S. GAAP financial measures 
 Management uses free cash flow, which is defined by the Company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less payments for property, plant, and equipment, in reviewing the financial performance of and cash generation by Woodward s various business groups and evaluating cash levels. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to grow organically and generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as paying interest on our indebtedness, repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, investing in research and 
 34 

development, purchasing our common stock, and paying dividends. In addition, securities analysts, investors, and others frequently use free cash flow in their evaluation of companies. 
 The use of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Our calculation of free cash flow may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, Operations and summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates and assumptions described below are those that we consider to be most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. All of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future economic and market conditions, and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. As estimates are updated or actual amounts are known, our critical accounting estimates are revised, and operating results may be affected by the revised estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures in this Management s Discussion and Analysis. 
 Revenue recognition 
 Revenue is recognized on contracts with customers for arrangements in which quantities and pricing are fixed and/or determinable and are generally based on customer purchase orders, often within the framework of a long-term supply arrangement with the customer. We recognize revenue for performance obligations within a customer contract when control of the associated product or service is transferred to the customer. Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while other contracts contain multiple performance obligations. Each product within a contract generally represents a separate performance obligation as we do not provide significant installation and integration services, the products do not customize each other, and the products can function independently of each other. 
 A contract's transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the customer obtains control of the associated product or service. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we generally use the observable standalone sales price for each distinct product or service within the contract to allocate the transaction price to the distinct products or services. In instances when a standalone sales price for each product or service is not observable within the contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price for each product or service, which is generally based on incurred costs plus a reasonable margin, for each distinct product or service in the contract. 
 When determining the transaction price of each contract, we consider contractual consideration payable by the customer and variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration, consisting of early payment discounts, rebates, and other sources of price variability, are included in the estimated transaction price based on both customer-specific information as well as historical experience. We regularly review our estimates of variable consideration on the transaction price and recognize changes in estimates on a cumulative catch-up basis as if the most current estimate of the transaction price adjusted for variable consideration had been known as of the inception of the contract. 
 35 

Point in time and over time revenue recognition 
 Control of the products generally transfers to the customer at a point in time, if the customer does not control the products as they are produced. We exercise judgment and consider the timing of right of payment, transfer of the risk and rewards, transfers of title, transfer of physical possession, and customer acceptance when determining when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon shipment of products. Performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized over time if: (i) the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being enhanced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use to us; and (ii) we have an enforceable right to payment with a profit. When services are provided, revenue from those services is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to customers as we perform the work. 
 For services that are not short-term in nature, manufacturing, repair, and overhaul MRO ), and sales of products that have no alternative use to us and an enforceable right to payment with a profit, we use an actual cost input measure to determine the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For these revenue streams, revenue is recognized over time as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred to-date for each contract and the total estimated costs for such contract at completion of the performance obligation (the cost-to-cost method). We have concluded that this measure of progress best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer, because incurred costs are integral to our completion of the performance obligation under the specific customer contract and correlate directly to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, and overhead. Contract cost estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events. These assumptions include labor productivity, and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. 
 Inventories 
 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory cost is determined using methods that approximate the first-in, first-out basis. We include product costs, labor, and related fixed and variable overhead in the cost of inventories. Inventory net realizable values are determined by giving substantial consideration to the expected product selling price. We estimate expected selling prices based on our historical recovery rates, general economic, and market conditions, the expected channel of disposition, and current customer contracts and preferences. Actual results may differ from our estimates due to changes in resale or market value and the mix of these factors. 
 We monitor inventory for events or circumstances, such as negative margins, recent sales history suggesting lower sales value, or changes in customer preferences, which would indicate the net realizable value of inventory is less than the carrying value of inventory, and management records adjustments as necessary. When inventory is written down below cost, such reduced amount is considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. Our recording of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value has not historically required material adjustments once initially established. 
 The carrying value of inventory was 609,092 at September 30, 2024 and 517,843 at September 30, 2023. If economic conditions, customer product requirements, or other factors significantly reduce future customer demand for our products from forecast levels, then future adjustments to the carrying value of inventory may become necessary. We attempt to maintain inventory quantities at levels considered necessary to fill firm and expected orders in a reasonable time frame, which we believe mitigates our exposure to future inventory carrying cost adjustments. 
 Reviews for impairment of goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets 
 Goodwill 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 806,643 of goodwill representing approximately 18 of our total assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. 
 The identification of reporting units and consideration of the aggregation of components into a single reporting unit under U.S. GAAP requires management judgment. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of reporting units, determined using discounted cash flows, with their carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its implied fair value. 
 36 

During the fourth quarter, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2024 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. The results of our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of July 31, 2024, indicated the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value, and accordingly, no impairment existed. 
 Indefinitely lived intangible asset 
 We have one indefinitely lived intangible asset consisting of the Woodward L Orange trade name. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset was 64,751, representing approximately 1 of our total assets. The Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of the Woodward L Orange intangible asset may be below its carrying amount. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset, determined using discounted cash flows based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach, with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its fair value. We have not recorded any impairment charges associated with the indefinitely lived intangible asset. 
 During the fourth quarter, we completed the annual impairment test, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, of the Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset as of July 31, 2024. The results of the annual impairment test performed as of July 31, 2024 indicated the estimated fair value of the Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset was in excess of its carrying value, and accordingly, no impairment existed. 
 As part of our ongoing monitoring efforts to assess goodwill and the Woodward L Orange trade name indefinite lived asset for possible indications of impairment, we will continue to consider a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to the global economic environment and its potential impact on our business. There can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows of certain reporting units or the Woodward L Orange business, the current economic environment, or the other inputs used in forecasting the present value of forecasted cash flows will prove to be accurate projections of future performance. 
 Income taxes 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. 
 During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The reserves are established when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained on review by tax authorities. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of an estimate. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will be consistent with what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the current provision for income taxes. 
 Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income, and the impact of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. Changes in the relevant facts can significantly impact the judgment or need for valuation allowances. In the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. 
 Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be affected by earnings that are different than those anticipated in countries which have lower or higher tax rates; by transfer pricing adjustments; and/or changes in tax laws, regulations, and accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions, or interpretations thereof. There can be no assurance that these items will remain stable over time. Additionally, we record through income tax expense all future excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from stock options exercised. This creates unpredictable volatility in the effective tax rate because the additional expense or benefit recognized each quarter is based on the timing of the employee s election to exercise any vested stock options outstanding, which is outside our control, and the market price of our shares at the time of exercise, which is subject to market volatility. 
 37 

Our effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, adjustments of valuation allowances, research tax credits, state taxes, and tax audit settlements. In addition to potential local country tax law and policy changes that could impact the provision for income taxes, management s judgment about and intentions concerning the repatriation of foreign earnings could also significantly impact the provision for income taxes. Management reassesses its judgment regularly, taking into consideration the potential tax impacts of these judgments, and intentions. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar Two rules that impose a global minimum tax rate of 15 . Numerous countries have enacted or are expected to enact legislation to be effective for Woodward as early as October 1, 2024, with general implementation of a global minimum tax for Woodward by October 1, 2025. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two model rules. We do not expect a material impact to our effective tax rate or cash flows based on currently enacted legislation and will continue to closely monitor evolving legislation and guidance that could change our current assessment .

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, we have exposures to interest rate risk from our long-term and short-term debt and our postretirement benefit plans, and foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations and foreign currency transactions. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk, Interest Rate Risk, and Related Hedging Activities 
 We are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates when we sell product in currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred. The functional currencies and our purchasing and sales activities primarily include USD, EUR, RMB, JPY, and GBP. We may also be impacted by changes in the relative buying power of our customers, which may impact sales volumes either positively or negatively. As these currencies fluctuate against each other, and other currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on sales, purchasing transactions, and labor. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is reduced through the maintenance of local production facilities in the markets we serve, which we believe creates a natural hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. 
 The percentages of our net sales denominated in a currency other than the USD were as follows:

Currency exchange rates vary daily and often one currency strengthens against the USD while another currency weakens. Because of the complex interrelationship of our worldwide supply chains and distribution channels, it is difficult to quantify the impact of a particular change in exchange rates. 
 We use derivative instruments as risk management tools that involve complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. From time to time, we will enter into a foreign currency exchange rate contract to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates on liabilities expected to be settled at a future date. Market risk arises from the potential adverse effects on the value of derivative instruments that result from a change in foreign currency exchange rates. We minimize this market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types of, and degree to which we enter into, derivative instruments. We enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only. We do not enter into or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no open foreign currency exchange rate contracts and all previous exchange rate derivative instruments were settled or terminated. 
 For more information on derivative instruments, see Note 8, Derivative instruments and hedging activities , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Our reported financial results of operations, including the reported value of our assets and liabilities, are also impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The assets and liabilities of substantially all of our subsidiaries outside the United States are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period. Earnings and cash flow statements are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange. Although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact, the translation changes may impact future borrowing capacity, debt covenants, and the overall value of our net assets. In addition, we also have assets and liabilities, specifically accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current inter-company receivables and payables, whose carrying amounts approximate their fair value, which are denominated in currencies other than their relevant functional currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is mitigated through several means, including the invoicing of customers in the same currency as the source of the products, and the prompt settlement of inter-company balances utilizing a global netting system.

in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2024 , compared to an increase in cash provided by operating activities of approximately during fiscal year 2023. Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the timing of billing differs from the timing of revenue recognized, such as when contract provisions require revenue to be recognized over time rather than at a point in time. Unbilled receivables primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied over time when the cost-to-cost method is utilized and the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer as there is not yet a right to payment in accordance with contractual terms. Unbilled receivables are recorded as a contract asset when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract.

Woodward has one indefinitely lived intangible asset consisting of the Woodward L Orange trade name. The Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of the Woodward L Orange intangible asset may be below its carrying amount. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset, determined using discounted cash flows, with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the Woodward L Orange intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its fair value. Woodward has not recorded any impairment charges against the L'Orange trade name intangible asset since it was acquired.

During fiscal year 2023, for purposes of how we assess performance, we determined that certain revenue was better aligned with our markets consisting of power generation, transportation, and oil and gas, rather than the reciprocating engines and industrial turbines, how it was previously reported. For comparability, we have reclassified revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022 to conform to the new presentation. This reclassification of revenue had no impact on our consolidated financial results.

Lessor arrangements Woodward has assessed its manufacturing contracts and concluded that certain of the contracts for the manufacture of customer products met the criteria to be considered a leasing arrangement embedded leases with Woodward as the lessor. The specific manufacturing contracts that met the criteria were those that utilized Woodward property, plant, and equipment and which is substantially (more than 90 dedicated to the manufacturing of the product(s) for a single customer. Woodward has dedicated manufacturing lines with four of its customers representing embedded leases, all of which qualified as operating leases with undefined quantities of future customer purchase commitments. Although Woodward expects to allocate some portion of future net sales to these customers to embedded lessor arrangements, it cannot provide expected future undiscounted lease payments from property, plant, and equipment leased to customers as of September 30, 2024. If, in the future, customers reduce purchases of related products from Woodward, the Company believes it will derive additional value from the underlying equipment by repurposing its use to support other customer arrangements.

Therefore, Woodward is accounting for its ownership interest in the JV using the equity method of accounting. The JV is a related party to Woodward. In addition, GE Aerospace will continue to pay contingent consideration to Woodward consisting of fifteen annual payments of each, which began on January 4, 2017, subject to certain claw-back conditions.

In connection with certain economic incentives related to Woodward s development of a second campus in the greater-Rockford, Illinois area for its Aerospace segment and Woodward s development of its corporate headquarters in Fort Collins, Colorado, Woodward received long-term notes from municipalities within the states of Illinois and Colorado. The fair value of the long-term notes was estimated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments received at an interest rate available to the Company at the end of the period for similarly rated municipal notes of similar maturity, which is a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. The interest rates used to estimate the fair value of the long-term notes were at September 30, 2024 and at September 30, 2023. From time to time, certain of Woodward s foreign subsidiaries will invest excess cash in short-term time deposits with a fixed maturity date of longer than three months but less than one year from the date of the deposit. Woodward believes that the investments are with creditworthy financial institutions. The fair value of the investments in short-term time deposits was estimated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments to be received at an interest rate available to the foreign subsidiary entering into the investment for similar short-term time deposits of similar maturity. This was determined to be a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. The interest rates used to estimate the fair value of the short-term time deposits was at September 30, 2024 and at September 30, 2023. The fair value of long-term debt was estimated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments at interest rates available to the Company at the end of the period for similar debt of the same maturity, which is a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. The weighted-average interest rates used to estimate the fair value of long-term debt were at September 30, 2024 and at September 30, 2023 .

. See Note 7, Financial instruments and fair value measurements , for the related fair value of the derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024. Derivatives instruments in fair value hedging relationships In May 2020, Woodward entered into a US dollar denominated intercompany loan payable with identical terms and notional value as the 2020 Floating-Rate Cross-Currency Swap, together with a reciprocal intercompany floating-rate cross-currency interest rate swap. The agreements were entered into by Woodward Barbados Euro Financing SRL Euro Barbados ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward. The US dollar denominated intercompany loan and reciprocal intercompany floating-rate cross-currency interest rate swap are designated as a fair value hedge under the criteria prescribed in ASC 815. The objective of the derivative instrument is to hedge against the foreign currency exchange risk attributable to the spot remeasurement of the US dollar denominated intercompany loan, as Euro Barbados maintains a Euro functional currency. For each floating-rate intercompany cross-currency interest rate swap, only the change in the fair value related to the cross-currency basis spread, or excluded component, of the derivative instrument is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI"). The remaining change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized in foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in Selling, general, and administrative costs in Woodward s Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The change in the fair value of the derivative instrument in foreign currency transaction gain or loss offsets the change in the spot remeasurement of the intercompany Euro and US dollar denominated loans. Hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the fair value changes of the derivative instrument, after excluding any fair value changes related to the cross-currency basis spread. The initial cost of the cross-currency basis spread is recorded in earnings each period through the swap accrual process. There are no credit-risk-related contingent features associated with the intercompany floating-rate cross-currency interest rate swap. Derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships In May 2020, Woodward entered into US dollar intercompany loans payable, with identical terms and notional values of each tranche of the 2020 Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps, together with reciprocal fixed-rate intercompany cross-currency interest rate swaps. The agreements were entered into by Euro Barbados and are designated as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in ASC 815. The objective of these derivative instruments is to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows attributable to the foreign currency exchange risk of cash flows for future principal and interest payments associated with the US dollar denominated intercompany loans over a thirteen-year period, as Euro Barbados maintains a Euro functional currency. For each of the fixed-rate intercompany cross-currency interest rate swaps, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in accumulated OCI and reclassified to foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in Selling, general, and administrative costs in Woodward s Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Reclassifications out of accumulated OCI of the change in fair value occur each reporting period based upon changes in the spot rate remeasurement of the Euro and US dollar denominated intercompany loans, including associated interest. Hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the fair value changes of the derivative instruments and such hedges are deemed to be highly effective in offsetting exposure to variability in foreign exchange rates. There are no credit-risk-related contingent features associated with these fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps. Derivatives instruments in net investment hedging relationships On , Woodward and Woodward International Holding B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward organized under the laws of The Netherlands (the BV Subsidiary ), each entered into a note purchase agreement (the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement relating to the sale by Woodward and the BV Subsidiary of an aggregate principal amount of of senior unsecured notes in a series of private placement transactions. Woodward issued aggregate principal amount of Woodward s Series M Senior Notes due (the Series M Notes ).

Woodward tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or at any time there is an indication goodwill may be impaired, commonly referred to as triggering events. Woodward completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2024 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The fair value of each of Woodward s reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow method. This method represents a Level 3 input and incorporates various estimates and assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, earnings margins, future tax rates, and the present value, based on an estimated weighted-average cost of capital (or the discount rate) and terminal growth rate, of forecasted cash flows. Management projects revenue growth rates, earnings margins, and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current operational results, expected performance, and operational strategies over a five-year period. These projections are adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and demand for certain products and require considerable management judgment. Forecasted cash flows used in the July 31, 2024 impairment test were discounted using weighted-average cost of capital assumptions ranging from to . The terminal values of the forecasted cash flows were calculated using the Gordon Growth Model and assumed an annual compound growth rate after five years of . These inputs, which are unobservable in the market and are Level 3 inputs, represent management s best estimate of what market participants would use in determining the present value of the Company s forecasted cash flows. Changes in these estimates and assumptions can have a significant impact on the fair value of forecasted cash flows. Woodward evaluated the reasonableness of the reporting units resulting fair values utilizing a market multiple method. The results of Woodward s goodwill impairment test performed as of July 31, 2024 did not indicate impairment of any of Woodward s reporting units.

Indefinite lived intangible assets The Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of the Woodward L Orange intangible asset may be below its carrying amount. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset, determined using discounted cash flows based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach, with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its fair value. Woodward has not recognized any impairment charges for this asset. During the fourth quarter, Woodward completed its annual impairment test of the Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset as of July 31, 2024 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. The fair value of the Woodward L Orange trade name intangible assets was determined using discounted cash flows based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach. This method represents a Level 3 input and incorporates various estimates and assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, royalty rates, future tax rates, and the present value, based on an estimated weighted-average cost of capital (or the discount rate) and terminal growth rate, of the forecasted cash flow. Management projects revenue growth rates and cash flows based on Woodward L Orange s current operational results, expected performance, and operational strategies over a five year period. These projections are adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and demand for certain products and require considerable management judgment.

. The terminal value of the forecasted cash flow was calculated using the Gordon Growth Model and assumed an annual compound growth rate after of . These inputs, which are unobservable in the market and are Level 3 inputs, represent management s best estimate of what market participants would use in determining the present value of the Company s forecasted cash flows. Changes in these estimates and assumptions can have a significant impact on the fair value of the forecasted cash flow. The results of impairment test performed as of July 31, 2024 indicated the estimated fair value of the Woodward L Orange trade name intangible asset was in excess of its carrying value, and accordingly, impairment existed.

Revolving credit facility Woodward maintains a revolving credit facility established under a revolving credit agreement among Woodward, a syndicate of lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, which provides for the option to increase available borrowings up to , subject to lenders' participation (as amended in October 2022, the "Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement"). Borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement can be made by Woodward and certain of its foreign subsidiaries in U.S. dollars or in foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar and generally bear interest at the Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("Euribor"), Sterling Overnight Index Average ("SONIA"), Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate ("TIBOR"), and Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") base rates plus to . The Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement matures on . Under the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, there were in principal borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024, at an effective interest rate of , compared to borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023.

 The obligations of Woodward and from time-to-time certain of Woodward s foreign subsidiaries, under the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Woodward MPC, Inc., Woodward HRT, Inc., or in case of obligations with any foreign subsidiaries of Woodward that are borrowers thereunder, Woodward L Orange GmbH, each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward. Short-term borrowings Woodward has other foreign lines of credit and foreign overdraft facilities at various financial institutions, which are generally reviewed annually for renewal and are subject to the usual terms and conditions applied by the financial institutions. Pursuant to the terms of the related facility agreements, Woodward s foreign performance guarantee facilities are limited in use to providing performance guarantees to third parties. Consistent with common business practice in China, Woodward's Chinese subsidiaries have issued bankers' acceptance notes ("Bank drafts") to Chinese suppliers in settlement of certain customer accounts payable. Bank drafts are financial instruments issued by Chinese financial institutions as part of financing arrangements between the financial institution and a customer of the financial institution. Bank drafts represent a commitment by the issuing financial institution to pay a certain amount of money at a specified future maturity date to the legal owner of the bankers' acceptance note as of the maturity date. Woodward has elected to adopt the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amounts of consideration at contract inception as the financing component associated with issuing bank drafts has a duration of less than one year. There were borrowings outstanding on Woodward s foreign lines of credit and foreign overdraft facilities as of both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Long-term debt , due ; unsecured

The BV Subsidiary issued (a) aggregate principal amount of the BV Subsidiary s Series N Senior Notes (the Series N Notes and (b) aggregate principal amount of the BV Subsidiary s Series O Senior Notes (the Series O Notes and together with the Series M Notes and the Series N Notes, the 2016 Notes ). On May 31, 2018, Woodward entered into a note purchase agreement (the 2018 Note Purchase Agreement relating to the sale by Woodward of an aggregate principal amount of of senior unsecured notes comprised of (a) aggregate principal amount of its Series P Senior Notes (the Series P Notes ), (b) aggregate principal amount of its Series Q Senior Notes (the Series Q Notes ), (c) aggregate principal amount of its Series R Senior Notes (the Series R Notes ), (d) aggregate principal amount of its Series S Senior Notes (the Series S Notes ), and (e) aggregate principal amount of its Series T Senior Notes (the Series T Notes , and together with the Series P Notes, the Series Q Notes, the Series R Notes, and the Series S Notes, the 2018 Notes, and, together with the USD Notes and 2016 Notes, the Notes ), in a series of private placement transactions. In connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, the Company entered into cross-currency swap transactions in respect of each tranche of the 2018 Notes, which effectively reduced the interest rates on the Series P Notes to per annum, the Series Q Notes to per annum, the Series R Notes to per annum, the Series S Notes to per annum and the Series T Notes to per annum. The Company entered into the 2020 Floating-Rate Cross-Currency Swap and 2020 Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps, which effectively resulted in the interest rates on the Series P Notes being per annum, the Series Q Notes to per annum, the Series R Notes to per annum, the Series S Notes to per annum and the Series T Notes to per annum (see Note 8, Derivative instruments and hedging activities ). Interest on the USD Notes are payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year until all principal is paid. Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 23 and September 23 of each year, until all principal is paid. None of the Notes were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and they may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Holders of the Notes do not have any registration rights. All of the issued Notes are held by multiple institutions. Woodward s payment and performance obligations under the Notes, including without limitation the obligations for payment of all principal, interest, and any applicable prepayment compensation amount, are guaranteed by (i) Woodward FST, Inc., Woodward MPC, Inc., and Woodward HRT, Inc., each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward, and (ii) in the case of the BV Subsidiary s Series N and O Notes, by Woodward. Woodward s obligations under the Notes rank equal in right of payment with all of Woodward s other unsecured unsubordinated debt, including its outstanding debt under its revolving credit facility. of its consolidated net worth. Woodward s Leverage Ratio cannot exceed to 1.0 during any material acquisition period, or to 1.0 at any other time on a rolling four quarter basis. In the event that Woodward s Leverage Ratio exceeds to 1.0 during any material acquisition period, the interest rate on each series of Notes will increase. The minimum consolidated net worth, prior year positive net income, and net cash proceeds resulting from certain issuances of stock for satisfaction of Woodward s leverage ratio are consistent between the Notes and Revolving Credit Agreement.

Restructuring charges During fiscal year 2023, the Company committed to a cost reduction plan ("Cost Reduction Plan") to better align the cost structure and recorded of restructuring charges. The charges recognized under the Cost Reduction Plan consist of workforce management costs primarily related to aligning the cost structure of the Company's Industrial segment with the current market conditions. All of the restructuring charges were recorded as nonsegment expenses and were paid as of September 30, 2023. In fiscal year 2022, the Company determined to implement a streamlined Aerospace and Industrial organizational and leadership structure designed to enhance the sales experience for customers, simplify operations, and increase profitability through improved execution. In connection with leadership changes arising from such reorganization, we recorded of restructuring charges as nonsegment expenses and were paid as of September 30, 2023. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded aggregate restructuring charges totaling as nonsegment expenses for two separate workforce management actions, one in our hydraulics systems business and one in our engine systems business. In fiscal year 2022, we experienced a challenging operating environment that included the ongoing impact of global supply chain and labor disruptions, along with high inflation, which resulted in changed business conditions as compared to when we initially recorded the restructuring charges in fiscal year 2021. We adapted to the changed business conditions by, among other initiatives, (i) developing and implementing plans to insource select machined components, (ii)

Woodward has recorded a net operating loss NOL deferred tax asset of as of September 30, 2024 and as of September 30, 2023. The majority of the NOL carryforwards as of September 30, 2024 expire at various times beginning in fiscal years 2027 through 2029. Woodward has recorded tax credits and incentives deferred tax assets of as of September 30, 2024 and as of September 30, 2023. The majority of the tax credit and incentive carryforwards as of September 30, 2024 expire at various times beginning in fiscal year 2025 through 2035. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when the realization of the deferred tax asset is less than 50 percent likely. Both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming Woodward s judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, and more weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Valuation allowances are reassessed whenever there are changes in circumstances that may cause a change in judgment. The change in the valuation allowance was primarily the result of adjusting an existing valuation allowance for a current year foreign net operating loss that we assess is not realizable. At September 30, 2024 , Woodward has not provided for taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of that it considered indefinitely reinvested. This balance has been reduced for foreign earnings that are now considered distributable and resulted in the booking of an associated net deferred tax liability of approximately in the qu arter. These earnings could become subject to income taxes if they are remitted as dividends, are loaned to Woodward or any of Woodward s subsidiaries located in the United States, or if Woodward sells its stock in the foreign subsidiaries. Any additional U.S. taxes could be offset, in part or in whole, by foreign tax credits. The amount of such taxes and application of tax credits would be dependent on the income tax laws and other circumstances at the time these amounts are repatriated. Based on these variables, it is impractical to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these funds were to be repatriated.

Effective tax rate 

In determining the tax amounts in Woodward s financial statements, estimates are sometimes used that are subsequently adjusted in the actual filing of tax returns or by updated calculations. In addition, Woodward occasionally has resolutions of tax items with tax authorities related to prior years due to the conclusion of audits and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are included in the Adjustments of prior period tax items line in the above table. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is primarily attributable to a smaller research and development credit, smaller net excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation as percent of current year earnings, fewer resolutions of tax items with taxing authorities in the current fiscal year, and increased return to provision items in the current fiscal year. This increase is partially offset by smaller current fiscal year projected future withholding taxes on unremitted earnings.

Ending balance 

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as of September 30, 2024 and as of September 30, 2023 of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. At this time, Woodward estimates that it is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by as much as in the next twelve months due to the completion of review by tax authorities, lapses of statutes, and the settlement of tax positions. Woodward accrues for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits and all other interest and penalties related to tax payments in tax expense. Woodward s tax returns are subject to audits by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, and these audits are at various stages of completion at any given time. Reviews of tax matters by authorities and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitation may result in changes to tax expense. Woodward s fiscal years remaining open to examination for U.S. federal income taxes include fiscal years and thereafter. Woodward s fiscal years remaining open to examination for significant U.S. state income tax jurisdictions include fiscal years and thereafter.

of their eligible prior year wages, to their personal Woodward Retirement Savings Plan accounts. In the second quarters of fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, Woodward fulfilled its annual Woodward stock contribution obligation using shares held in treasury stock by issuing a total of shares of common stock for a value of in fiscal year 2024, total shares of common stock for a value of in fiscal year 2023, and shares of common stock for a value of in fiscal year 2022. The Woodward Retirement Savings Plan (the WRS Plan held shares of Woodward stock as of September 30, 2024 and shares as of September 30, 2023. The shares held in the WRS Plan participate in dividends and are considered issued and outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. Accrued liabilities included obligations to contribute shares of Woodward common stock to the WRS Plan in the amount of as of September 30, 2024 and as of September 30, 2023. 

Defined benefit plans Woodward has defined benefit plans that provide pension benefits for certain retired employees in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. Woodward also provides other postretirement benefits to its employees including postretirement medical benefits and life insurance benefits. Postretirement medical benefits are provided to certain current and retired employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries in the United States and the United Kingdom. Life insurance benefits are provided to certain retirees in the United States under frozen plans, which are no longer available to current employees. A September 30 measurement date is utilized to value plan assets and obligations for all of Woodward s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Excluding the Woodward HRT Plan, which is only partially frozen to salaried participants, the defined benefit plans in the United States were frozen in fiscal year 2007; no additional employees may participate in the U.S. plans, and no additional service costs will be incurred.

. Compensation increase assumptions, where applicable, are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions. In determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, Woodward assumes that the historical long-term compound growth rates of equity and fixed-income securities will predict the future returns of similar investments in the plan portfolio. Investment management and other fees paid out of the plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. Mortality assumptions are based on published mortality studies developed primarily based on past experience of the broad population and modified for projected longevity trends. The projected benefit obligations in the United States as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were based on the Society of Actuaries SOA Pri-2012 Mortality Tables Report using the SOA s Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2019 MP-2019 and projected forward using a custom projection scale based on MP-2019 with a -year convergence period and a long-term rate of . As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , mortality assumptions in Japan were based on the Standard rates 2020, and mortality assumptions for the United Kingdom pension scheme were based on the self-administered pension

in the United Kingdom, in Japan, and in Germany. Woodward expects to have pension plan contributions in fiscal year 2025 in the United States. Pension plan assets The overall investment objective of the pension plan assets is to earn a rate of return over time which, when combined with Company contributions, satisfies the benefit obligations of the pension plans and maintains sufficient liquidity to pay benefits. As the timing and nature of the plan obligations varies for each Company sponsored pension plan, investment strategies have been individually designed for each pension plan with a common focus on maintaining diversified investment portfolios that provide for long-term growth while minimizing the risk to principal associated with short-term market behavior. The strategy for each of the plans balances the requirements to generate returns, using investments expected to produce higher returns, such as equity securities, with the need to control risk within the pension plans using less volatile investment assets, such as debt securities. A strategy of more equity-oriented allocation is adopted for those plans which have a longer-term investment plan based on the timing of the associated benefit obligations. Risks associated with the plan assets include interest rate fluctuation risk, market fluctuation risk, risk of default by debt issuers, and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the assets are managed by established, professional investment firms and performance is evaluated regularly by the Company s investment committee against specific benchmarks and each plan s investment objectives. Liability management and asset class diversification are central to the Company s risk management approach and overall investment strategy. The assets of the U.S. plans are invested in actively managed mutual funds. The assets of the plans in the United Kingdom and Japan are invested in actively managed pooled investment funds. Each individual mutual fund or pooled investment fund has been selected based on the investment strategy of the related plan, which mirrors a specific asset class within the associated target allocation. The plans in Germany are unfunded and have no plan assets. Pension plan assets at September 30, 2024 and 2023 do not include any direct investment in Woodward s common stock.

and a Medicare supplemental plan after age . Life insurance benefits are also provided to certain retirees in the United States under frozen plans which are no longer available to current employees. A September 30 measurement date is utilized to value plan assets and obligations for Woodward s other postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement medical benefit plans, other than the plan assumed in an acquisition in fiscal year 2009, were frozen in fiscal year 2006, and no additional employees may participate in the plans. Generally, employees who had attained age and had rendered 10 or more years of service before the plans were frozen were eligible for these postretirement medical benefits. Certain participating retirees are required to contribute to the plans in order to maintain coverage. The plans provide postretirement medical benefits for approximately retired employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries and may provide future benefits to active employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries, upon retirement, if the employees elect to participate. All the postretirement medical plans are fully insured for retirees who have attained age . 

Weighted-average discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost 

The discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments. . Mortality assumptions are based on published mortality studies developed primarily based on past experience of the broad population and modified for projected longevity trends. The projected benefit obligations in the United States as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were based on the SOA Pri-2012 Mortality Tables Report using the SOA s MP-2019 and projected forward using a custom projection scale based on MP-2019 with a -year convergence period and a long-term rate of .

Woodward pays plan benefits from its general funds; therefore, there are no segregated plan assets as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. The accumulated benefit obligations of the Company s postretirement plans were at September 30, 2024 and at September 30, 2023. The largest contributor to the actuarial loss affecting the Company s postretirement plans accumulated benefit obligations was a decrease in the discount rate.

During fiscal year 2023, we repurchased shares of our common stock for under the 2022 Authorization, as compared to shares of our common stock for under the 2022 Authorization during fiscal year 2022. In January 2024, the Board terminated the 2022 Authorization, which was nearing expiration, and concurrently authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to of Woodward's outstanding shares of common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions over a period ending in January 2027 (the "2024 Authorization"). During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock for under the 2024 Authorization. Stock-based compensation Provisions governing non-qualified stock option awards, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and performance restricted stock units ("PSUs") are included in the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the 2017 Plan and with respect to outstanding stock options awarded in or prior to fiscal year 2016, the 2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan ). The 2017 Plan was approved by Woodward s stockholders in January 2017 and is a successor plan to the 2006 Plan. As of September 14, 2016, the effective date of the 2017 Plan, the Board delegated authority to administer the 2017 Plan to the Human Capital Compensation Committee of the Board, including, but not limited to, the power to determine the recipients of awards and the terms of those awards.

The fair value of RSUs granted are estimated using the closing price of the Company s stock on the grant date. The Company has also granted RSUs to certain employees under its form attraction and retention RSU agreement (the Form Attraction and Retention RSU Agreement ), which has from time to time been used for new hires and specific retention purposes. RSUs granted under the Form Attraction and Retention RSU Agreement are generally scheduled to fully vest on the third or fourth anniversary of the respective grant dates, and in each case, subject to continued employment.

Performance restricted stock units In November 2023, the Company granted PSUs to certain eligible employees under the form PSU agreement that generally will vest subject to a market condition and a service condition through the performance period. The market condition associated with the awards is based on the Company's relative total shareholder return ("TSR") compared to the TSR generated by the other companies that comprise the S P 400 Midcap Index over a performance period. Performance at target will result in vesting and issuance of the number of PSUs granted, equal to payout.

Stock-based compensation expense Woodward recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Pursuant to the form agreements used by the Company, with terms approved by the administrator of the applicable plan, the requisite service period can be less than the four-year vesting period based on grantee s retirement eligibility. As such, the recognition of stock-based compensation expense associated with some grants can be accelerated to a period of less than four years, including immediate recognition of stock-based compensation expense on the date of grant. 

In connection with an executive separation and release agreement entered into by the Company, Woodward recognized an additional and of stock-based compensation expense, before tax, during fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 , there was approximately of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements, including stock option s, restricted stock, and performance stock awards. The pre-vesting forfeiture rates for purposes of determining stock-base d compensation expense recognized were estimated to be for members of Woodward s Board and for all others. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately years.

The U.S. Government, and other governments, may terminate any of Woodward s government contracts (and, in general, subcontracts) at their convenience, as well as for default based on specified performance measurements. If any of Woodward s government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, the Company generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of Woodward s government contracts were to be terminated for Woodward s default, the U.S. Government generally would pay only for the work accepted and could require Woodward to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. Government could also hold Woodward liable for damages resulting from the default. Woodward is currently involved in claims, pending or threatened litigation or other legal proceedings, investigations, and/or regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business, including, among others, those relating to product liability claims, employment matters, worker s compensation claims, contractual disputes, product warranty claims, and alleged violations of various laws and regulations. Woodward accrues for known individual matters using estimates of the most likely amount of loss where it believes that it is probable the matter will result in a loss when ultimately resolved and such loss is reasonably estimable. Legal costs are expensed as incurred and are classified in Selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Woodward is partially self-insured in the United States for healthcare and worker s compensation up to predetermined amounts, above which third party insurance applies. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of related claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage, and the established accruals for liabilities. While the outcome of pending claims, legal and regulatory proceedings, and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that any liabilities that may result from these claims, proceedings, and investigations will not have a material effect on Woodward s liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. In the event of a change in control of Woodward, as defined in change-in-control agreements with its current corporate officers, Woodward may be required to pay termination benefits to any such officer if such officer s employment is terminated within following the change of control. 

 reportable segments - Aerospace and Industrial. When appropriate, Woodward s reportable segments are aggregations of Woodward s operating segments. Woodward uses operating segment information internally to manage its business, including the assessment of operating segment performance and decisions for the allocation of resources between operating segments. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those of the Company. Woodward evaluates segment profit or loss based on internal performance measures for each segment in a given period. In connection with that assessment, Woodward generally excludes matters such as certain charges for restructuring, interest income and expense, certain gains and losses from asset dispositions, or other non-recurring and/or non-operationally related expenses.

Exhibit 4.2 

 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 
 The following description of Woodward, Inc. s Woodward , our , or the corporation common stock and certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or our certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated bylaws, or our bylaws, is a summary of selected general terms thereof and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, copies of which have been filed with the SEC and are available for inspection. 
 Our authorized capital stock consists of 150,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.001455 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.003 per share. 
 Common Stock 
 Voting Rights 
 Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held by such stockholder which has voting power on the matter in question. Holders of our common stock are entitled to cumulative voting for the election of directors, which means that in each election of directors each holder of our common stock is entitled to cast as many votes as the number of shares of common stock held by such holder multiplied by the number of directors to be elected and may cast all such votes for the election of one nominee or distribute such votes among two or more nominees. 
 In an election for directors that is not a contested election, as defined in our certificate of incorporation, directors will be elected by a majority of the voting power cast in the election of directors. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered votes cast. In a contested election, directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. 
 Dividend Rights 
 Holders of common stock may receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by our board of directors at any regular or special meeting. Holders of common stock have no preemptive or redemption rights. All outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. 
 Preferred Stock 
 Our board of directors is authorized to establish one or more series of preferred stock and to fix the dividend rights and terms, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms, liquidation preferences, and any other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to each series of preferred stock. The number of authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock without a vote of the holders of the shares of preferred stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the resolution or resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of the series of preferred stock. 
 Delaware law provides that the holders of preferred stock have the right to vote separately as a class on any proposal involving fundamental changes in the rights of holders of that preferred stock. This right is in addition to any voting rights that may be provided for in the applicable certificate of designation for preferred stock. 
 Certain Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 General 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make more difficult the acquisition of control of Woodward by means of a tender offer, open market purchases, a proxy contest or otherwise. A description of these provisions is set forth below. 
 Classified Board of Directors; Removal Only for Cause 
 - 1 - 

Exhibit 4.2 

 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws divide our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving staggered, three-year terms. In addition, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock. The classification of our board of directors means that, unless directors are removed for cause, it could require at least two annual meetings of stockholders for a majority of stockholders to make a change of control of the board of directors, because only a portion of the directors will be elected at each meeting. A significant effect of a classified board of directors may be to deter hostile takeover attempts, because an acquirer could experience delay in replacing a majority of the directors. A classified board of directors also makes it more difficult for stockholders to effect a change of control of the board of directors, even if such a change of control were to be sought due to dissatisfaction with the performance of our directors. 
 Board Vacancies 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorizes our board of directors to fill vacant directorships or to increase the size of our board of directors, which may deter a stockholder from removing incumbent directors and simultaneously gaining control of our board of directors by filling the vacancies created by this removal with its own nominees. 
 Advance Notice of Director Nominees and Other Matters to Come Before Stockholder Meetings 
 Our bylaws require stockholders to notify us prior to the date which is not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders of any nominations they will propose for directors or other matters they wish to propose at the annual meeting, subject to certain exceptions if the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date or the size of the board of directors is increased. This provision may have the effect of precluding a nomination for the election of directors at a particular annual meeting if the proper procedures are not followed and may discourage or deter a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of Woodward. 
 No Stockholder Action by Written Consent 
 Our certificate of incorporation provides that all action by stockholders must be taken at a meeting duly called and held. The stockholders may not act by written consent. This provision prevents our stockholders from initiating or effecting any action by written consent, thereby limiting the ability of our stockholders to take actions opposed by our board of directors. 
 Special Meetings of Stockholders 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called by the board of directors or the chairman of the board of directors, and when requested in writing and signed by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Such request must state the purpose of the proposed meeting and, in the case of a request by holders of outstanding common stock, must be delivered personally or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the secretary of the corporation. Business transacted at all special meetings of stockholders must be confined to the matters set forth in the notice. This provision could have the effect of inhibiting stockholder actions that require a special meeting of stockholders unless our board of directors or chairman calls such a meeting. 
 Limitation of Director Liability 
 Our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless otherwise prohibited under the Delaware General Corporation Law, no director will be liable to Woodward or to our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. The effect of this provision may be to reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited Woodward and our stockholders. This provision does not limit a stockholder s ability to seek or obtain relief under federal securities laws. 
 Supermajority Voting 
 - 2 - 

Exhibit 4.2 

 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock: 
 for the adoption of any amendment, alteration, change or repeal of any provision of the certificate of incorporation; 

for the adoption of any agreement for the merger or consolidation of Woodward with or into any other corporation; 

to authorize any sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of Woodward; and 

to authorize the dissolution of Woodward. 

The supermajority voting provision described above regarding any amendment, alteration, change or repeal of any provision of the certificate of incorporation is primarily designed to prevent an acquirer from circumventing the takeover defense provisions contained in our governing documents. The other supermajority voting provisions described above discourage attempts to take over the company by significant stockholders and may enable a minority of the stockholders to prevent consummation of significant business combinations or other transactions. 
 Our certificate of incorporation also expressly authorizes each of our board of directors and our stockholders to independently adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws. However, our stockholders may only adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and no bylaw may be adopted by the stockholders that impairs or impedes the power of the board of directors under the certificate of incorporation. This supermajority voting provision could enable holders of just over one-third of our common stock to prevent holders of a substantial majority of our common stock who do not approve of certain provisions of the bylaws from amending or repealing such provisions. This supermajority voting provision also promotes continuity with respect to the management of our day-to-day operations and may prevent a purchaser who acquires a majority of the shares of our common stock from adopting bylaws that are not in the best interests of the minority stockholders or from repealing bylaws that are in such minority stockholders best interests. 
 Authorized but Unissued Shares 
 Subject to the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval. These shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of a majority of our common stock by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 
 Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law 
 We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the time of the transaction in which the person or entity became an interested stockholder, unless: 
 prior to that time, either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the board of directors of the corporation; 

upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, excluding for this purpose shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers of the corporation and by specified employee benefit plans; or 

at or after such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. 

- 3 - 

Exhibit 4.2 

 For the purposes of Section 203, a business combination is broadly defined to include mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or within the immediately preceding three years owned 15 or more of the corporation s voting stock. The statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with respect to us and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us. 
 Transfer Agent and Registrar 
 The transfer agent and registrar for our capital stock is Equiniti Trust Company, LLC EQ ), 55 Challenger Road, Floor 2, Ridgefield Park, NJ 07660.

 For Non-Employee Directors 
 
 THIS NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (the Agreement ), entered into between you (the Participant and Woodward, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), hereby grants an award of Non-Qualified Stock Options (or options to the Participant as of the grant date set forth in Section 1 below (the Grant Date with reference to the facts described in the recitals below. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Woodward, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Plan ). 
 
 A. Pursuant to the Plan, the Company is authorized to grant options for shares of its Common Stock to Service Providers of the Company or any subsidiary in order to attract and retain the best available individuals for positions of substantial responsibility, provide additional incentive to such individuals, and promote the success of the Company's business, as well as to encourage stock ownership by Plan participants, thereby aligning their interests with those of the Company s stockholders. 

B. The Company desires to grant options to the Participant in accordance with the Plan and this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION OF the foregoing facts, the Company hereby grants options to the Participant, as follows: 
 
 1. Grant of Options. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan, and effective as of the Grant Date, the Company hereby grants to the Participant options to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company at the closing price on the Nasdaq stock market on the Grant Date (such price, the Exercise Price ), as set forth in the following table: 

Participant 
 [NAME] 

Grant Date 
 [DATE] 

Number of Non-Qualified Stock Options 
 [NUMBER OF OPTIONS] 

Exercise Price 
 [SHARE PRICE AT MARKET CLOSE ON GRANT DATE] 

The number and kind of shares subject to these options and the purchase price per share are subject to adjustment as provided in the Plan. 
 
 Except as otherwise provided below, these options shall expire as of market close on the last trading day before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the grant date (the expiration of the options ). 
 
 2. Exercise of Options. Subject to the terms of the Plan, these options may be exercised only by the Participant at such time as the options become vested and remain exercisable pursuant to this Agreement. 

Subject to the limited exceptions set forth in Sections 3 and 4, all of the options granted hereunder will vest in accordance with the following vesting schedule and will remain exercisable until the expiration of the options: 

Date 
 Number of Non-Qualified Stock Options That Will Vest 

[ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF GRANT DATE] 
 [#] 

For the avoidance of doubt, and subject to the limited exceptions set forth in Sections 3 and 4, if the Participant ceases to be a Service Provider prior to the vesting date, the options granted hereunder will continue to vest on the schedule set forth herein and remain exercisable until the expiration of the options. 
 
 These options shall be exercised by delivery of written notice (or, if permitted by the Administrator, electronic notice) to the Company stating the number of shares with respect to which the options are being exercised, together with full payment of the purchase price therefor, and such other representations and/or agreements as may be required by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. Payment must be made in cash (including a bank cashier s check or certified check) unless the Administrator determines to accept any other form or combination of forms permitted by the Plan as the Administrator shall advise the Participant in writing. If the Administrator so determines, the payment may be made in whole or in part by delivery of shares of Common Stock previously owned and held at least six months by the Participant. Shares of Common Stock used for payment shall be valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise as determined by the Administrator. 
 
 3. Death and Disability . 

Death of Participant. 
 If the Participant dies before the options granted hereunder vest and become exercisable pursuant to Section 2, then (i) all options granted hereunder will become immediately vested and exercisable on the date of the Participant s death, and (ii) the options granted hereunder shall continue to be exercisable until the expiration of the options and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not lapse earlier on account of such death. 
 
 Disability of Participant. 
 If the Participant suffers a Disability (as determined by the Administrator) before the options granted hereunder vest and become exercisable pursuant to Section 2, then (i) all options granted hereunder will become immediately vested and exercisable on the date the Administrator makes a determination that the Participant has suffered a Disability, and (ii) the options granted hereunder shall continue to be exercisable until the expiration of the options and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not lapse earlier on account of such Disability. 
 Disability shall be determined by the Administrator with the advice of a physician acceptable to the Administrator with respect to the permanent and total disability of the Participant. 
 
 4. Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control (which for the avoidance of doubt is defined in the Plan), all options not yet vested and exercisable pursuant to Section 2 will become immediately vested and exercisable on the date of such Change in Control. 

5. Assignment or Transfer. These options are not transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable only by the Participant during the Participant s lifetime, unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator as set forth in the Plan. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of these options, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under and execution, attachment or similar process, these options and any rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void. 

2 

6. Plan and Administrator. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the construction of the terms of the Agreement shall be controlled by the terms of the Plan, a summary of which accompanies the Agreement, and the rights of the Participant will be subject to modification and termination in certain events as provided in the Plan. The Administrator s interpretations of and determinations under any of the provisions of the Plan or this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding upon the Participant, and shall be given the maximum possible deference permitted by law. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of the Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the Plan s provisions will govern. 

7. Compliance with Securities Laws. These options may not be exercised and no shares shall be issued in respect hereof, unless in compliance with applicable federal and state tax and securities laws. If an exemption from registration is not available under applicable federal and state securities laws, the Company shall have no obligation to file a registration statement. 

7.1. Certificate Legends. The certificates for shares purchased pursuant to these options shall bear any legends deemed necessary by the Administrator including, without limitation, legends with respect to federal and state securities laws. 

7.2. Representations of the Participant. As a condition to the exercise of these options, the Company, in its discretion, may require the Participant to deliver to the Company such signed representations (if any) as the Company deems necessary or appropriate for compliance with applicable securities laws of the U.S. and any other applicable jurisdictions. 

7.3. Resale. The Participant s ability to transfer shares purchased pursuant to these options or securities acquired in lieu thereof or in exchange therefore may be restricted under applicable federal or state securities laws. The Participant shall not resell or offer for resale such shares or securities unless they have been registered or qualified for resale under all applicable federal and state securities laws or an exemption from such registration or qualification is available in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company. 

8. Notice. Every notice or other communication relating to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be mailed or delivered to the party for whom it is intended at such address as may from time to time be designated by such party in a notice mailed or delivered to the other party as herein provided; provided, however , that unless and until some other address be so designated, all notices or communications by the Participant to the Company or the Administrator shall be mailed or delivered to the Company to the attention of its Corporate Secretary at 1081 Woodward Way, Fort Collins, Colorado 80524, and all notices or communications by the Company or the Administrator to the Participant may be given to the Participant personally or may be mailed to the Participant at the most recent address which the Participant has provided in writing to the Company. 

9. Tax Treatments. These options are non-qualified stock options and shall not be treated as incentive stock options pursuant to Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Participant acknowledges that the tax treatment of these options, shares subject to these options or any events or transactions with respect thereto may be dependent upon various factors or events which are not determined by the Plan or this Agreement. Neither the Company nor the Administrator make any representations with respect to and hereby disclaims all responsibility as to such tax treatment. 

10. Tax Obligations. The Participant shall be responsible for any and all Tax Obligations in connection with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not deduct or withhold, or require the Participant to remit to the Company, any amounts to satisfy any Tax Obligations, nor shall the Company have any liability with respect thereto. 

3 

11. Consent to Electronic Delivery . The Company may choose to deliver certain statutory materials relating to the Plan, in addition to this Agreement, in electronic form. By accepting this option grant you agree that the Company may deliver these documents in an electronic format. If at any time you would prefer to receive paper copies of these documents, as you are entitled to, the Company would be pleased to provide copies free of charge. Please contact the Company s Stock Plan Administrator to request paper copies of these documents. 

By accepting this Agreement, you agree to all of the terms and conditions described above and in the Woodward, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan.

Exhibit 10.41 

 Restricted Stock Unit Agreement 
 For Non-Employee Directors 
 
 THIS RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (the Agreement ), entered into between you (the Participant and Woodward, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), hereby grants an award of Restricted Stock Units (or RSUs , as defined below) to the Participant as of the grant date set forth in Section 1 below (the Grant Date with reference to the facts described in the recitals below. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Woodward, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Plan ). 
 A. Pursuant to the Plan, the Company, by action of the Administrator of the Plan, is authorized to grant RSUs to Service Providers in order to attract and retain the best available individuals for positions of substantial responsibility, provide additional incentive to such individuals, and promote the success of the Company's business, as well as to encourage stock ownership by Plan participants, thereby aligning their interests with those of the Company s stockholders. 

B. The Company desires to grant RSUs to the Participant in accordance with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION OF the foregoing facts, the Company hereby grants RSUs to the Participant, as follows: 
 1. Grant of RSUs. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan, the Company hereby grants to the Participant on the Grant Date the number of RSUs set forth in the following table: 

Participant 
 [NAME] 

Grant Date 
 [DATE] 

Number of RSUs 
 [NUMBER OF RSUs] 

The number and kind of shares subject to this grant of RSUs are subject to adjustment as provided by the Plan. 
 
 2. Company s Obligation to Pay . Each RSU represents the right to receive a Share on the date it vests. Unless and until the RSUs will have vested in the manner set forth in Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 of this Agreement, the Participant will have no right to payment of any such RSUs, nor any rights associated therewith, including dividend payments (subject to Sections 4 and 17 below) or voting rights. Prior to actual payment of any vested RSUs, such RSUs will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company. 
 3. Vesting of RSUs. Subject to any acceleration provisions contained in the Plan and this Agreement, the RSUs will vest in accordance with the following vesting schedule: 

Date 
 Number of RSUs That Will Vest 

[ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF GRANT DATE] 
 [#] 

Exhibit 10.41 

 For the avoidance of doubt, and subject to the limited exceptions set forth in this Agreement, if the Participant ceases to be a Service Provider prior to the vesting date, the RSUs granted hereunder will continue to vest on the schedule set forth herein. 
 
 4. Dividend Equivalent RSUs . On or near each date that a cash dividend is paid to holders of Common Stock, the Participant will receive additional RSUs equal to: (i) the cash dividend the Participant would have received in connection with the aggregate of each unvested RSU if each such unvested RSU had been in the form of one Share actually held by the Participant (such aggregate cash dividend, Dividend Equivalents ), divided by (ii) the Fair Market Value of a Share on the dividend payment date (the quotient of (i) and (ii), the Dividend Equivalent RSUs ). The Dividend Equivalent RSUs shall be deemed to be reinvested in additional RSUs (which may thereafter accrue additional Dividend Equivalents). Each Dividend Equivalent RSU will vest on the same vesting date corresponding to the underlying RSU with respect to which it was awarded, and will otherwise be subject to the same conditions applicable to the underlying RSUs. Unless expressly provided otherwise, as used elsewhere in this Agreement RSUs shall include any Dividend Equivalent RSUs that have been credited to Participant. 
 5. Death and Disability . 
 (a) Death of Participant . If the Participant dies before the RSUs granted hereunder vest pursuant to Section 3, then all RSUs granted hereunder will become immediately vested on the date of the Participant s death. 
 (b) Disability of Participant . If the Participant suffers a Disability (as determined by the Administrator) before the RSUs granted hereunder vest pursuant to Section 3, then all RSUs granted hereunder will become immediately vested on the date the Administrator makes a determination that the Participant has suffered a Disability. 
 Disability shall be determined by the Administrator with the advice of a physician acceptable to the Administrator with respect to the permanent and total disability of the Participant. 
 6. Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control (which for the avoidance of doubt is defined in the Plan), all RSUs not yet vested pursuant to Section 3 will become immediately vested on the date of such Change in Control. 
 
 7. Payment after Vesting . 
 
 (a) General Rule . Subject to Section 13, any RSUs (including Dividend Equivalent RSUs) that vest will be paid to the Participant (or in the event of the Participant s death, to his or her properly designated beneficiary or estate) in whole Shares. Subject to the provisions of Section 7(b), such vested RSUs shall be paid in whole Shares as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case within sixty (60) days following the vesting date . In no event will the Participant be permitted, directly or indirectly, to specify the taxable year of payment of any RSUs payable under this Agreement. 
 (b) Acceleration . 
 (i) Discretionary Acceleration . The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the unvested RSUs at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such RSUs will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator. If the Participant is a U.S. taxpayer, the payment of Shares vesting pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall in all cases be paid at a time or in a manner that is exempt from, or complies with, Section 

Exhibit 10.41 

 409A. The prior sentence may be superseded in a future agreement or amendment to this Agreement only by direct and specific reference to such sentence. 
 (ii) Specified Employees . Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement or any other agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the Grant Date), if the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the RSUs is accelerated in connection with the Participant s termination as a Service Provider (provided that such termination is a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by the Company), other than due to the Participant s death, and if (x) the Participant is a U.S. taxpayer and a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such termination as a Service Provider and (y) the payment of such accelerated RSUs will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to the Participant on or within the six (6) month period following the Participant s termination as a Service Provider, then the payment of such accelerated RSUs will not be made until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of the Participant s termination as a Service Provider , unless the Participant dies following his or her termination as a Service Provider, in which case, the RSUs will be paid in Shares to the Participant s estate as soon as practicable following his or her death . 
 (c) Section 409A . It is the intent of this Agreement that it and all payments and benefits to U.S. taxpayers hereunder be exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the RSUs provided under this Agreement or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or so comply. Each payment payable under this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). However, in no event will the Company reimburse the Participant, or be otherwise responsible for, any taxes or costs that may be imposed on the Participant as a result of Section 409A. For purposes of this Agreement, Section 409A means Section 409A of the Code, and any final Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder, as each may be amended from time to time.

Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any unvested RSUs, or any right or privilege conferred thereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, any unvested RSUs, and the rights and privileges conferred thereby, immediately will become null and void. 
 9. Plan and Administrator.

 14. Rights as Stockholder . Neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in book entry form) will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Participant (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation, and delivery, the Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares. 
 15. No Guarantee of Continued Service . PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH PARTICIPANT S RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY TO TERMINATE PARTICIPANT S RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WHICH TERMINATION, UNLESS PROVIDED OTHERWISE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, MAY BE AT ANY TIME. 
 16. No Advice Regarding Grant . The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Participant s participation in the Plan, or the Participant s acquisition or sale of the Shares underlying the RSUs.

 split, reorganization, reincorporation, reclassification, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs, the Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, will adjust the number and class of Shares covered by the RSUs subject to this Agreement, as determined in the discretion of the Administrator.

 18. Beneficiary Designation. The Participant may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under this Agreement is to be paid in case of the Participant s death before the Participant receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant. Any such designation shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only if made during the Participant s lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant s death shall be paid to the Participant s estate. 
 19. Severability . In the event any provision of this Agreement is held illegal or invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect. Upon any determination that any provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, such provision shall be modified to the extent necessary to render it valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its intent, or if such modification is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that is legal and enforceable and that achieves the same objective. 
 20. No Waiver . Either party s failure to enforce any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions, nor prevent that party from thereafter enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted both parties herein are cumulative and shall not constitute a waiver of either party s right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances. 
 21. Successors and Assigns . The Company may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to single or multiple assignees, and this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company.

The Participant understands that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Administrator at any time. 
 24. Modifications to the Agreement . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties on the subjects covered.

Exhibit 10.41 

 otherwise avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition under Section 409A in connection with this award of RSUs. 
 25. Governing Law; Venue.

 A. Requirements Imposed by Rule 10b5-1 and Company Policy: 

1. The trading plan must be in writing and signed by the person adopting the trading plan. 

2. The trading plan must be adopted at a time when: 

a) the person adopting the trading plan is not aware of any material nonpublic information; and 

b) there is no quarterly, special or other trading blackout in effect with respect to the person adopting the plan. 

3. The trading plan must be entered into in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1, and the person adopting the trading plan must act in good faith with respect to the trading plan throughout its duration. 

4. The trading plan must include representations that, on the date of adoption of the trading plan, the person adopting the trading plan:

Exhibit 97.1 

 WOODWARD, INC. 
 CLAWBACK POLICY 
 As Amended and Restated effective October 2, 2023 
 Woodward, Inc. (the Company is committed to strong corporate governance. As part of this commitment, the Compensation Committee (the Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the Board ), having previously adopted a Clawback Policy initially effective as of September 13, 2016 and as amended from time to time, hereby amends and restates the Clawback Policy (this amended and restated Clawback Policy, the Policy ), effective as of October 2, 2023 (the Effective Date ). This Policy is intended to further the Company s pay-for-performance philosophy and to comply with applicable law by providing for the recovery of certain executive compensation in the event of an Accounting Restatement. The capitalized terms in this Policy are defined below. 
 The application of the Policy to Executive Officers is not discretionary and applies without regard to whether an Executive Officer was at fault, except to the limited extent provided below. 
 Persons Covered by the Policy 
 This Policy is binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers (as defined below). 
 The Committee may (in its discretion) require Executive Officers to sign an acknowledgement that each such Executive Officer agrees to comply with the Policy, but this Policy will be enforceable against each Executive Officer regardless of whether an acknowledgement was signed by the Executive Officer. 
 Administration of the Policy 
 The Board and the Committee each have full authority to administer this Policy. The Board and the Committee each are authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. The Board, in its discretion, may authorize another committee of independent members of the Board to administer the Policy, in which case all references herein to the Committee shall be deemed to include such other committee of independent directors, unless the context clearly requires otherwise. All determinations of the Board and/or Committee and any other administrator of the Policy will be final and binding on all interested persons and will be given the maximum deference permitted by law. 
 Compensation Covered by the Policy 
 This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation that is Received on or after October 2, 2023 by a person (a) after such individual became an Executive Officer, (b) who was an Executive Officer at any time during the applicable performance period for that Incentive-Based Compensation, and (c) during the Covered Period Clawback Eligible Incentive-Based Compensation ). 
 Events Requiring Application of the Policy 
 If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error 

Exhibit 97.1 

 were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (an Accounting Restatement ); AND 
 any Executive Officer has Received Clawback Eligible Incentive-Based Compensation that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had such Incentive-Based Compensation been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid by or on behalf of the Executive Officer (such compensation, the Excess Compensation (which the Nasdaq listing standards describe as erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation); 
 then, the Company will recover reasonably promptly the amount of such Excess Compensation in compliance with this Policy unless an exception applies under this Policy. 
 Determining Excess Compensation for Certain Incentive-Based Compensation 
 To determine the amount of Excess Compensation for Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where it is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement: 
 The amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received; and 

The Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Exchange. 

Exceptions to the Policy 
 The Company must recover the Excess Compensation in accordance with this Policy, except to the limited extent that the conditions set forth below are met and the Board and/or Committee has made a determination that recovery of the Excess Compensation would be impracticable: 
 A.	The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered; provided, however, that prior to reaching this conclusion, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover such Excess Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the Exchange; or 
 B.	Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022; provided, however, that prior to reaching this conclusion, the Company must obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the Exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to the Exchange; or 
 C.	Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 
 Defined Terms in this Policy 
 The capitalized terms in this Policy have the following meaning, unless clearly required otherwise by the context. 

Exhibit 97.1 

 Accounting Restatement is defined in the Events Requiring Application of the Policy section of this Policy. 
 Accounting Restatement Determination Date means the earliest to occur of: 
 
 A. The date the Board, a committee of the Board, or one or more of the officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement; and 

B. The date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 

Clawback Eligible Incentive-Based Compensation is defined in the Compensation Covered by the Policy section of this Policy. 
 Covered Period means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Accounting Restatement Determination Date, as well as any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years in accordance with Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act. The Company s obligation to recover Excess Compensation (as defined below) is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed. 
 Excess Compensation is defined in the Events Requiring Application of the Policy section of this Policy. 
 Executive Officer means each individual who either (a) at the time of determination is designated as an officer of the Company in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 16a-1(f), (b) at any time prior to the time of determination was designated as an officer of the Company in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 16a-1(f). 
 Exchange is defined in the Repayment of Excess Compensation section of this Policy. 
 Exchange Act means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and any valid regulation or applicable guidance of general applicability thereunder. 
 Financial Reporting Measure means a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure. Stock price and total shareholder return are also Financial Reporting Measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. 
 The following items of compensation are not Incentive-Based Compensation under the Policy: salaries, bonuses paid solely at the discretion of the Committee or the Board that are not paid from a bonus pool that is determined by satisfying a Financial Reporting Measure, bonuses paid solely upon satisfying one or more subjective standards and/or completion of a specified employment period, 

Exhibit 97.1 

 non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely upon satisfying one or more strategic measures or operational measures, and equity awards for which the grant is not contingent upon achieving any Financial Reporting Measure performance goal and vesting is contingent solely upon completion of a specified period (e.g., time-based vesting equity awards) and/or attaining one or more non-Financial Reporting Measures. 
 Policy means this Clawback Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. 
 Received means that the Financial Reporting Measure specified for earning an Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained in the relevant Company fiscal period, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that fiscal period. As described above in Compensation Covered by the Policy , Incentive-Based Compensation that is Received before the Effective Date is not subject to this amended and restated Policy, although such Incentive-Based Compensation may be subject to recoupment as provided in the Company s Clawback Policy adopted effective as of September 13, 2016 and as amended from time to time (that is, the Policy as in effect prior to this amendment and restatement). 
 Repayment of Excess Compensation 
 The Company will seek recovery of any Excess Compensation reasonably promptly, and any affected Executive Officer is required to repay such Excess Compensation. Subject to applicable law, the Company may recover such Excess Compensation by requiring the Executive Officer to repay such amount to the Company by direct payment to the Company or such other means or combination of means as the Board and/or Committee determines to be appropriate (which determinations need not be identical as to each Executive Officer), including but not limited to (a) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards; (b) offsetting the amount to be recovered from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Executive Officer, whether earned before or after the date of the foregoing determination and whether earned pursuant to employment or under a severance, consulting or other post-employment agreement or arrangement; (c) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards (which for the avoidance of doubt may also include any time-based vesting equity awards) or appropriating the proceeds associated with their vesting or disposition; (d) requiring reimbursement of previously-paid cash Incentive-Based Compensation; and/or (e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board and/or Committee, in each case, notwithstanding any Executive Officer s belief (whether legitimate or reasonably or not) that the Excess Compensation had been previously earned under applicable law and therefore not subject to recoupment. This Policy does not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce an Executive Officer s obligations to the Company or to discipline an Executive Officer, including (without limitation) termination of employment, institution of civil proceedings, reporting of misconduct to appropriate governmental authorities, reduction of future compensation opportunities or change in role. 
 This Policy is in addition to the requirements of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and any other applicable regulatory requirements. 
 Notwithstanding the terms of any of the Company s organizational documents (including, but not limited to, the Company s Bylaws), any corporate policy or any contract (including, but not limited to, any indemnification agreement), the Company will not indemnify any Executive Officer or former Executive Officer against any loss of Excess Compensation. The Company will not pay for or reimburse insurance 

Exhibit 97.1 

 premiums for an insurance policy that covers potential recovery obligations. In the event the Company is required to recover Excess Compensation from a former Executive Officer pursuant to this Policy, the Company will be entitled to seek such recovery in order to comply with applicable law, regardless of the terms of any release of claims or separation agreement the former Executive Officer may have signed. 
 This Policy is intended to comply with Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act, and with the listing standards of the Nasdaq stock exchange (the Exchange ), the trading platform on which the securities of the Company primarily are listed. This Policy will be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act and with the listing standards of the Exchange, including (but not limited to) any interpretive guidance provided by the Exchange. 
 Other Important Information 
 The Board and the Committee each may amend and/or terminate this Policy from time to time. Unless otherwise determined by the Board or the Committee, this Policy will terminate upon the Company ceasing to be a listed issuer within the meaning of Section 10D of the Exchange Act. 
 If any provision of this Policy or the application of any such provision to any Executive Officer shall be adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Policy, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to render any such provision or application enforceable.
