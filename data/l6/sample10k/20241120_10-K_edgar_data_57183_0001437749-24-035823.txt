Information contained on Spire s website is not incorporated by reference in this report. The SEC also maintains a website that contains Spire s SEC filings (sec.gov). 
 
 Human Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Spire had 3,475 employees, including 1,922 for Spire Missouri and 765 for Spire Alabama. We believe that: 

1. 
 the safety and well-being of our employees is one of our most important responsibilities, 

2. 
 the development, education and advancement of employees is key to our sustainability, and 

3. 
 embracing an inclusive workforce full of diverse backgrounds and perspectives drives innovation. 

We continue to implement processes, procedures and programs that reflect our focus on consistently reducing our employee injury and motor vehicle accident rates. Our Good Catch Close Call program encourages employees to proactively identify, mitigate and report workplace hazards, reducing potential work-related injuries. We also utilize safety cameras in all Company vehicles, which are accompanied by real-time, in-cab driver alerts and virtual and managed driver coaching, to promote safe driving habits. In 2024, core driving metrics showed significant improvements in areas of speed, following distance, distracted driving and positive driving behaviors. Also in 2024, senior management began to engage with safety leaders throughout the Company in new and more direct ways to promote safety awareness, communications, alignment of priorities and to address pressing issues in the field. 
 
 Supporting wellness, we offer incentives for weight management and gym membership, as well as employee assistance programs to provide counseling services and emotional support, and we have a formalized comprehensive well-being program that focuses on the physical, emotional, social and financial health of every employee.

All employees have access to developmental assessments, customized training, specialized degree programs, and partnerships with best-in-class organizations related to industry courses, leadership and management workshops and computer application development seminars. In 2024, we rolled out 2 new leadership programs. The Leadership Development Series is tailored for Spire directors, managing directors and officers. The program includes two core workshops focused on exemplary leadership practices and inclusivity.

 We regularly review and adjust our affirmative action plans based on placement and utilization rates, and we strive to create an even more diverse and inclusive work environment. Our Human Rights Policy demonstrates that Spire understands its universal responsibility to respect human rights and provides the basis for publicly affirming our values and embedding the responsibility into Spire s operations and the way we do business. 
 
 The Company believes labor relations with its employees are good. Should that condition change, the Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions that could negatively impact the Company s system operations, customer service, results of operations and cash flows.

GAS UTILITY 
 
 Overview 
 
 Spire Missouri is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas. Spire Missouri is the largest natural gas distribution utility system in Missouri, serving approximately 1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas in Missouri. Spire Missouri purchases natural gas in the wholesale market from producers and marketers and ships the gas through interstate pipelines into its own distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Spire Missouri also transports gas through its distribution system for certain larger customers who buy their own gas on the wholesale market. Spire Missouri delivers natural gas to customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC), primarily through rate cases that can take up to eleven months to be finalized. The earnings of Spire Missouri are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. 
 
 Spire Alabama is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas principally in central and northern Alabama, serving more than 0.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers. Spire Alabama is the largest natural gas distribution utility in the state of Alabama and is regulated by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC). Among the cities served by Spire Alabama are Birmingham, the center of the largest metropolitan area in the state, and Montgomery, the state capital. Spire Alabama purchases natural gas through interstate and intrastate suppliers and distributes the purchased gas through its distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and other end-users of natural gas. Spire Alabama also transports gas through its distribution system for certain large commercial and industrial customers for a transportation fee. For most of these transportation service customers, Spire Alabama also purchases gas on the wholesale market for sale to the customer upon delivery to the Spire Alabama distribution system. All Spire Alabama services are provided to customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the APSC. 
 
 Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi (collectively, Spire EnergySouth are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to 0.1 million customers in the Mobile, Alabama area and south-central Mississippi. Spire Gulf is regulated by the APSC, and Spire Mississippi is regulated by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC). 
 
 The Utilities seek to provide reliable natural gas services at a reasonable cost, while maintaining and building secure and dependable infrastructures. The Utilities strategies focus on improving both performance and the ability to recover their authorized distribution costs and rates of return. The Utilities distribution costs are the essential, primarily fixed, expenditures they must incur to operate and maintain more than 60,000 miles of mains and services comprising their natural gas distribution systems and related storage facilities. The Utilities distribution costs include wages and employee benefit costs, depreciation and maintenance expenses, and other regulated utility operating expenses, excluding natural and propane gas expense. Distribution costs are considered in the rate-making process, and recovery of these types of costs is included in revenues generated through the Utilities tariff rates approved by their respective public service commissions. 
 
 Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama also have off-system sales and capacity release income streams that are regulated by tariff but remain subject to fluctuations in market conditions. Some of the factors impacting the level of off-system sales include the availability and cost of Spire s natural gas supply, the weather in its service areas and the weather in other markets. When Spire s service areas experience warmer-than-normal weather while other markets experience colder weather or supply constraints, some of Spire s natural gas supply is available for sale to third parties not on Spire s system. 
 
 The Utilities work actively to reduce the impact of wholesale natural gas price volatility on their costs by strategically structuring their natural gas supply portfolios to increase their gas supply availability and pricing alternatives. They may also use derivative instruments to hedge against significant changes in the commodity price of natural gas. Nevertheless, the overall cost of purchased gas remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. The Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi and the Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider of Spire Alabama allow the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the public service commissions, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including costs, cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the use of derivative instruments to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas. As of September 30, 2024, Spire Missouri had active derivative positions, but Spire Alabama has had no gas supply derivative instrument activity since 2010. The Utilities believe they will continue to be able to obtain sufficient gas supply. The price of natural gas supplies and other economic conditions may affect sales volumes, due to the conservation efforts of customers, and cash flows associated with the timing of collection of gas costs and related accounts receivable from customers.

Total annual average number of customers for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama for fiscal 2024 was 1,208,565 and 430,282, respectively. 
 
 Spire Missouri is the only distributor of natural gas within its franchised service areas, while Spire Alabama is the main distributor of natural gas in its service areas. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have franchises in nearly all the communities where they provide service with terms varying from five years to an indefinite duration. A franchise is essentially a municipal permit to install and maintain pipes and construct other facilities in the community. All of the franchises are free from unduly burdensome restrictions and are adequate for the conduct of Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s current public utility businesses in their respective states. In recent years, although certain franchise agreements have expired, the Utilities have continued to provide service in those communities without formal franchises. 
 
 The principal competition for the Utilities comes from the local electric companies. Other competitors in the service areas include suppliers of fuel oil, coal, and propane, as well as natural gas pipelines that can directly connect to large volume customers. Coal has been price competitive as a fuel source for very large boiler plant loads, but environmental requirements have shifted the economic advantage to natural gas. Oil and propane can be used to fuel boiler loads and certain direct-fired process applications, but these fuels require on-site storage, thus limiting their competitiveness. Competition also comes from district steam systems in the downtown areas of both St. Louis and Kansas City and from municipally or publicly owned natural gas distributors located adjacent to the Alabama service territories. Direct use of renewables will continue to grow in the future and compete against distributed generation using natural gas.

Table of Contents 

Residential, commercial, and industrial customers represent approximately 93 and 84 of fiscal 2024 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Given the current level of natural gas supply and market conditions, the Utilities believe that the relative comparison of natural gas equipment and operating costs with those of competitive fuels will not change significantly in the foreseeable future, and that these markets will continue to be supplied by natural gas. In new multi-family and commercial rental markets, the Utilities competitive exposures are presently limited to space and water heating applications. 
 
 Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama offer gas transportation service to its large commercial and industrial customers. Transportation customers represent approximately 2 and 15 of fiscal 2024 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. The Spire Missouri tariff approved for that type of service produces a margin similar to that which Spire Missouri would have received under their regular sales rates. Similarly, Spire Alabama s tariff is based on Spire Alabama s sales profit margin so that operating margins are unaffected. 
 
 Natural Gas Supply 
 
 The Utilities fundamental gas supply strategy is to meet the two-fold objective of 1) ensuring a dependable gas supply is available for delivery when needed and 2) insofar as is compatible with that dependability, purchasing gas that is economically priced. In structuring their natural gas supply portfolio, the Utilities focus on natural gas assets that are strategically positioned to meet the Utilities primary objectives. 
 
 Spire Missouri focuses its gas supply portfolio around a number of large natural gas suppliers with equity ownership or control of assets strategically situated to complement its regionally diverse firm transportation arrangements. Spire Missouri utilizes Midcontinent, Gulf Coast, Northeast, and Rocky Mountain gas sources to provide a level of supply diversity that facilitates the optimization of pricing differentials as well as protecting against the potential of regional supply disruptions. Further, Spire STL Pipeline may deliver up to 400,000 million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day of natural gas into eastern Missouri, of which Spire Missouri is the foundation shipper with a contractual commitment of 350,000 MMBtu per day. 
 
 In fiscal 2024 , Spire Missouri purchased natural gas from 29 different suppliers to meet its total service area current gas sales and storage injection requirements. Spire Missouri entered into firm agreements with suppliers including major producers and marketers providing flexibility to meet the temperature-sensitive needs of its customers. Natural gas purchased by Spire Missouri for delivery to its service areas included 40.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) through the Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. (Southern Star) system, 28.1 Bcf through the Enable Mississippi River Transmission LLC (MRT) system, 23.0 Bcf through the Spire STL Pipeline, 7.2 Bcf through the Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC (TIGT) system, 9.1 Bcf through the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, LP (PEPL) system, and 0.7 Bcf through the Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC (REX) system. Spire Missouri also holds firm transportation arrangements on several other interstate pipeline systems that provide access to gas supplies upstream. Some of Spire Missouri s commercial and industrial customers purchased their own gas with Spire Missouri transporting 50.3 Bcf to them through its distribution system. 
 
 The fiscal 2024 peak day send out of natural gas to Spire Missouri East customers, including transportation customers, occurred on January 14, 2024. The average temperature was 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit in St. Louis, and on that day Spire Missouri East customers consumed 1.03 Bcf of natural gas. This peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to St. Louis through the MRT, Missouri Gas Pipeline LLC (now Spire MoGas Pipeline), Spire STL Pipeline, and Southern Star transportation systems, and from Spire Missouri s on-system storage. 
 
 The fiscal 2024 peak day send out of natural gas to Spire Missouri West customers, including transportation customers, occurred on January 14, 2024. The average temperature was -9 degrees Fahrenheit in Kansas City, and on that day Spire Missouri West customers consumed 0.90 Bcf of natural gas. This peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to Kansas City through the Southern Star, PEPL, TIGT, and REX transportation systems. 
 
 Spire Alabama s distribution system is connected to two major interstate natural gas pipeline systems, Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (Southern Natural Gas) and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco). It is also connected to two intrastate natural gas pipeline systems.

Spire Alabama purchases natural gas from various natural gas producers and marketers. Certain volumes are purchased under firm contractual commitments with other volumes purchased on a spot market basis. The purchased volumes are delivered to Spire Alabama s system using a variety of firm transportation, interruptible transportation and storage capacity arrangements designed to meet the system s varying levels of demand. 
 
 In fiscal 2024, Spire Alabama purchased natural gas from 23 different suppliers to meet current gas sales, storage injection, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction requirements, of which one supplier is under a long-term supply agreement. Approximately 55.8 Bcf was purchased for delivery by Southern Natural Gas, 1.1 Bcf by BBT-AlaTenn, 4.4 Bcf by Transco, and 16.1 Bcf through intrastate pipelines to the Spire Alabama delivery points for its residential, commercial, and industrial customers. 
 
 The fiscal 2024 peak day send out for Spire Alabama was 0.6 Bcf of natural gas on January 20, 2024, when the average temperature was 20 degrees Fahrenheit in Birmingham, of which 86 was met with supplies transported through Southern Natural Gas, Transco, and intrastate facilities. The remaining 14 was fulfilled with LNG. 
 
 Spire Gulf s distribution system is directly connected to interstate pipelines, natural gas processing plants and gas storage facilities. Spire Gulf buys from a variety of producers and marketers, with BP Energy Company being the primary supplier. 
 
 Natural Gas Storage 
 
 Spire Missouri believes it currently has ample storage capacity to meet the demands of its distribution system, particularly to augment its supply during peak demand periods. Spire Missouri has a contractual right to store 22.0 Bcf of gas in MRT s storage facility located in Unionville, Louisiana, 16.0 Bcf of gas storage in Southern Star s system storage facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma, and 1.4 Bcf of firm storage on PEPL s system storage. MRT s tariffs allow injections into storage from May 1 through November 1 and require the withdrawal from storage of all but 4.4 Bcf from November 1 through May 1. Southern Star tariffs allow both injections and withdrawals into storage year-round with ratchets that restrict the associated flows dependent upon the underlying inventory level per the contracts. 
 
 In addition, Spire Missouri supplements pipeline gas with natural gas withdrawn from its own underground storage field located in St. Louis and St. Charles Counties in Missouri. The field is designed to provide approximately 0.35 Bcf of natural gas withdrawals on a peak day and provides the ability to reinject natural gas during the heating season to replenish or increase deliverability, subject to maximum annual net withdrawals of approximately 4.0 Bcf of natural gas based on the inventory level that Spire Missouri plans to maintain. 
 
 Spire Alabama has a contractual right to store 12.7 Bcf of gas with Southern Natural Gas, 0.5 Bcf of gas with Gulf South Pipeline, 0.2 Bcf of gas with Transco and 0.2 Bcf of gas with Tennessee Gas Pipeline. In addition, Spire Alabama has 2.0 Bcf of on-system LNG storage that can provide the system with up to an additional 0.2 Bcf of natural gas daily to meet peak day demand. 
 
 Spire Gulf obtains adequate storage capacity through Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP, and Enstor Gas, LLC s Bay Gas Storage. 
 
 Regulatory and Environmental Matters 
 
 For details on regulatory matters, see Note 15 , Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 The Utilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that, to date, have not materially affected the Utilities or the Company s financial position and results of operations. For a detailed discussion of environmental matters, see Note 16 , Commitment and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.

GAS MARKETING 
 
 Spire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related services throughout the U.S., which includes customers inside and outside of the Utilities service areas. For fiscal 2024 and 2023, Spire Marketing volumes averaged 1.32 Bcf/day and 1.40 Bcf/day, respectively. The majority of Spire Marketing s business is derived from the procurement and physical delivery of natural gas to a diverse customer base, primarily in the central and southern U.S. Through its retail operations, Spire Marketing offers natural gas marketing services to large commercial and industrial customers, while its wholesale business consists of producers, pipelines, power generators, municipalities, storage operators, and utility companies. Wholesale activities currently represent a majority of the total Gas Marketing business. The Gas Marketing strategy is to leverage its market expertise and risk management skills to manage and optimize the value of its portfolio of commodity, transportation, park and loan, and storage contracts while controlling costs and acting on new marketplace opportunities. 
 
 In the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into agreements to purchase natural gas at a future date in order to lock up supply to cover future sales commitments to its customers. To secure access to the markets it serves, Spire Marketing contracts for transportation capacity on various pipelines from pipeline companies directly and from other parties through the secondary capacity market. Throughout fiscal 2024, Spire Marketing held approximately 1 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity. In addition, to ensure reliability of service and to provide operational flexibility, Spire Marketing enters into firm storage contracts and interruptible park and loan transactions with various companies, where it is able to buy and retain gas to be delivered at a future date, at which time it sells the natural gas to third parties. As of September 30, 2024 , Spire Marketing has contracted for approximately 18 B cf of such storage and park and loan capacity for the 2024-2025 winter season. 
 
 Spire Marketing utilizes its natural gas supply agreements, transportation agreements, park and loan agreements, storage agreements and other executory contracts to support a variety of services to its customers at competitive prices. It closely monitors and manages the natural gas commodity price and volatility risks associated with providing such services to its customers through the use of a variety of risk management activities, including the use of exchange-traded/cleared derivative instruments and other contractual arrangements. Spire Marketing is committed to managing commodity price risk while it seeks to expand the services that it now provides. Nevertheless, income from the Gas Marketing operations is subject to more fluctuations in market conditions than the Utilities operations. 
 
 The Gas Marketing business is directly impacted by the effects of competition in the marketplace, the impacts of new infrastructure, surplus natural gas supplies, and the addition of new demand from exports, power generation and industrial load. Spire Marketing s management expects a growing need for marketing services across the country as customers manage seasonal variability and marketplace volatility.

MIDSTREAM 
 
 Spire s midstream operations consist of Spire Storage West, Spire Storage Salt Plains (jointly, Spire Storage ), Spire STL Pipeline, and Spire MoGas Pipeline, all at least partially under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). 
 
 Spire Storage West, located in southwestern Wyoming, consists of two storage fields operating under one FERC market-based rate tariff currently authorized to provide up to 55 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity to customers primarily in the western region of the U.S. The actual storage capacity was approximately 23 Bcf as of September 30, 2024, and management is in the process of expanding it to 39 Bcf by 2025. 
 
 Spire Storage Salt Plains is located in north central Oklahoma and serves markets in the midcontinent and midwestern U.S. Spire Storage Salt Plains is connected to Southern Star Pipeline and Oklahoma Gas Transmission. The facility operates under intrastate regulation with authorizations from FERC under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act to provide certain interstate storage, transportation, and hub services and has a certificated capacity of 13 Bcf. 
 
 Spire STL Pipeline owns and operates a FERC-regulated 65-mile pipeline connecting the Rockies Express Pipeline in Scott County, Illinois, to delivery points in St. Charles County and St. Louis County, Missouri, including Spire MoGas Pipeline and Spire Missouri s storage facility, and its operating revenue is derived primarily from Spire Missouri as its foundation shipper. 
 
 Spire MoGas Pipeline (or simply MoGas comprises a 263-mile FERC-regulated natural gas pipeline and a connected 75-mile gas distribution system. The MoGas pipeline, connected to the Rockies Express Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, Mississippi River Transmission and Spire STL Pipeline, serves natural gas utilities/municipals in western St. Louis and south-central Missouri. The distribution system serves the U.S. Army s Fort Leonard Wood near Rolla, Missouri. 
 
 In its Midstream segment, Spire seeks to drive growth through supporting natural gas grid reliability, the ability to manage exposure to gas price volatility, and providing access to key supply basins for the shipment of natural gas. These transportation and storage operations serve a variety of natural gas customers, including Spire s other businesses. 
 
 Absolute natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment, but there is a relationship between natural gas prices and the revenues derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas. Natural gas price trends and demand for natural gas influence these price relationships through market volatility or changes in absolute prices of one supply/market point to another. Further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs Spire serves could influence the volumes of gas transported or stored on Spire s system and the related transportation and storage rates.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Spire s, Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s businesses and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below. The risks described below are those management considers to be material. When considering any investment in these companies securities, investors should carefully consider the following information, as well as information contained in the caption Forward-Looking Statements, Item 7A, and other documents Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama file with the SEC. This list is not exhaustive, and management places no priority or likelihood based on the risk descriptions, order of presentation or grouping. 
 
 RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LITIGATION FACTORS 
 
 Regulatory and legislative developments in the energy industry related to climate change or in support of increased energy efficiency may adversely affect operations and financial results. 
 
 There have been a number of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane and carbon dioxide. Adoption of this type of legislation by Congress or similar legislation by states or localities, or the adoption of related regulations by federal, state or local governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, restricting the use of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, or restricting the construction of infrastructure could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, adversely affect the demand for natural gas and/or midstream services, or impact the prices charged to customers, potentially reducing customer growth opportunities and/or increasing the cost of doing business. 
 
 In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives by the federal, state and local governments addressing greenhouse gas emissions or restricting the use of natural gas could adversely affect customer demand. The promulgation of regulations of the emissions of greenhouse gases and efficiency for residential gas furnaces and other gas appliances or the potential enactment of congressional legislation addressing global warming and climate change may decrease customer usage, encourage fuel switching from gas to other energy forms, and may result in future additional compliance costs that could impact the Utilities financial conditions and results of operations. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on the Company s and the Utilities future business, financial condition or financial results. 
 
 In March 2024, the SEC adopted climate disclosure rules to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures by public companies for more consistent, comparable, and reliable information about the financial effects of climate-related risks on operations and how companies manage those risks. These rules have been stayed due to pending litigation but could become effective in the future. To the extent these rules become effective, the Company s efforts to comply could require significant additional expenditures. 
 
 Regulation of the Utilities businesses may impact rates they are able to charge, costs, and profitability. 
 
 The Utilities are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. At the state level, the Utilities are regulated in Missouri by the MoPSC, in Alabama by the APSC, and in Mississippi by the MSPSC. These state public service commissions regulate many aspects of the Utilities distribution operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, the rates the Utilities may charge customers, the terms of service to their customers, transactions with their affiliates, the rate of return they are allowed to realize, and the accounting treatment for certain aspects of their operations. For further discussion of these accounting matters, see Regulatory Accounting under Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7. 
 
 Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items (such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; and operating expenses) and affects multiple disclosures in the Company s financial statements. There is a risk that the state public service commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. A material disallowance of deferred costs could adversely affect the Utilities results of operations. 

12

Table of Contents 

The MoPSC also approves Spire Missouri s Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS). The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to upgrade its infrastructure and enhance its safety and reliability without the necessity of a formal rate case. Such investments are subject to review, and there is risk that any material disallowance of costs under ISRS could adversely affect the timing of revenues and cash flows. Without legislative action, the ISRS statute related to gas utilities will expire on August 28, 2029. 
 
 The Utilities ability to obtain and timely implement rate increases and rate supplements to maintain the current rate of return is subject to regulatory review and approval. There can be no assurance that they will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or continue earning the current authorized rates of return. Spire Alabama s and Spire Gulf s rate setting process, Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE), is subject to regulation by the APSC and is implemented pursuant to APSC orders expiring September 30, 2025. RSE adjustments would continue after that date unless the APSC enters an order to the contrary in a manner consistent with the law. Spire Mississippi is subject to regulation by the MSPSC and utilizes the Rate Stabilization Adjustment (RSA) Rider. For further details, see Note 15 , Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 The Utilities could incur additional costs if required to adjust to new laws or regulations, revisions to existing laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations. In addition, as the regulatory environment for the natural gas industry increases in complexity, the risk of inadvertent noncompliance could also increase. If the Utilities fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, whether existing or new, they could be subject to fines, penalties, business interruption or other enforcement action by the authorities that regulate the Utilities operations. 
 
 Federal safety and integrity regulations related to pipeline and storage operators and owners of critical infrastructure may impose significant costs and liabilities on the Company . 
 
 The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) requires pipeline and natural gas storage operators to develop integrity management programs to evaluate their pipelines comprehensively and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in areas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. The Company is required to maintain programs that are intended to assess pipeline integrity. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures. PHMSA constantly updates its regulations to ensure the highest levels of pipeline safety. As the operator of pipelines, Spire is required to: 

perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; 

identify and characterize applicable threats to pipelines; 

improve data collection, integration and analysis; 

repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and 

implement preventative and mitigating actions. 

The PHMSA amendment to the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2020 is anticipated to go into effect in 2028. This would, among other things, increase the frequency of leak detection surveys, promote advanced leak detection programs, and require accelerated repair of leaks found. 
 
 The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires owners and operators of specified pipeline facilities to take action to prevent disruption and degradation to their infrastructure to achieve the following security outcomes: 

develop network segmentation policies and controls 

create access control measures to secure and prevent unauthorized access to critical cyber systems; 

build continuous monitoring and detection policies and procedures to detect threats and correct anomalies; and 

reduce the risk of exploitation of unpatched systems in a timely manner using a risk-based methodology. 

As such, pipeline owners and operators are required to establish and execute a TSA-approved Cybersecurity Implementation Plan, develop and maintain a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, and establish a Cybersecurity Assessment Program. To date, Spire is compliant with these requirements. 
 
 Costs to comply with these and other such future safety and integrity regulations are significant. Additionally, should the Company fail to comply with applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders, it could be subject to significant fines, penalties, business interruption or other enforcement actions.

Table of Contents 

Environmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures or increase operating costs. 
 
 The Utilities and Midstream companies are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations. These laws and regulations require these businesses to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and approvals. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and failure to obtain any required permits and licenses may result in costs in the form of fines, penalties, business interruptions or other enforcement actions, which may be material. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and/or new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to these companies or their facilities, thereby impacting the cost of compliance. With the overturning of the 40-year-old Chevron Doctrine on June 28, 2024, which had provided for deference to agencies interpretation of regulations in litigation against those agencies, there is additional uncertainty going forward regarding current and future regulatory interpretations. The discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions, including former manufactured gas plant sites, and adverse claims under environmental laws and regulations may result in expenditures and liabilities, which could be material. To the extent environmental compliance costs are self-insured, or not fully covered by insurance or recovered in rates from customers, those costs may have an adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Utilities liquidity may be adversely affected by delays in recovery of their costs, due to regulation. 
 
 In the normal course of business, there is a lag between when the Utilities incur increases in certain of their costs and the time in which those costs are considered for recovery in the ratemaking process. Cash requirements for increased gas supply costs, operating costs, increased funding levels of defined benefit pension and postretirement costs, capital expenditures, interest expense and other increases in the costs of doing business, including inflation, can require outlays of cash prior to the authorization of increases in rates charged to customers, as approved by the MoPSC, APSC, or MSPSC. Accordingly, the Utilities liquidity can be adversely impacted to the extent higher costs are not timely recovered from their customers. 
 
 Changes to income tax policy, certain tax elections, tax regulations and future taxable income could adversely impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company has significantly reduced its current federal and state income tax obligations over the past few years through tax planning strategies and application of tax rules which included the use of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property. As a result, the Company generated large annual taxable losses that have resulted in significant federal and state net operating losses. The Company plans to utilize these net operating losses in the future. The value of these net operating losses could be reduced if the Company cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the net operating losses generated prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) before they expire due to income tax policy changes, lower-than-expected financial performance and/or regulatory actions. The major provisions of the TCJA will expire on December 31, 2025, unless Congress extends them. 
 
 Changes to income tax policy, laws and regulations, including but not limited to changes in tax rates, could adversely impact the Company. Those impacts could include reducing the value of its net operating losses and could result in material charges to earnings. Further, the Company s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 
 
 The Company may be involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The Company may be involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, environmental issues, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. For further details, see Contingencies in Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require the Company to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in its financial statements, or to the extent they are self-insured or not covered by insurance, could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition.

Table of Contents 

Commodity markets and derivative instruments are regulated by federal agencies, and new developments in this area may adversely impact Spire Marketing s results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 As a participant in the natural gas market, Spire Marketing is subject to applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders administered by FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), including those directed generally to prevent fraud or manipulation involving natural gas transactions (physical or financial transactions). Spire Marketing could be subject to fines, penalties, business interruption or other enforcement actions by the FERC or CFTC, or both, for failure to comply with such rules. New regulatory and legislative actions may adversely impact Spire Marketing s results of operations and financial condition by potentially reducing customer growth opportunities and/or increasing the costs of doing business. 
 
 Spire Marketing uses bilateral contracts and derivative instruments such as futures contracts, options and swaps to hedge or mitigate ongoing commercial risks. Most standardized swaps, under the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations from the CFTC, are required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility, subject to certain exceptions. These regulations may also require compliance with certain margin requirements for over-the-counter derivative contracts with certain regulated entities, which could adversely affect liquidity and ability to use derivatives to hedge risks. In addition, the CFTC s rules require companies, including Spire Marketing, to maintain regulatory records of swap transactions, and to report swaps to centralized swap data repositories, among other compliance obligations. 
 
 Although Spire Marketing may qualify for exceptions to certain of these CFTC rules, its derivatives counterparties are likely subject to capital, margin, documentation and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. These obligations may increase transaction costs and may make it more difficult for Spire Marketing to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms or affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available swap counterparties. In that event, Spire Marketing s inability to enter into derivatives instruments or other commercial risk hedging transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and expose it to unhedged commercial risks, including potential adverse changes in commodity prices. 
 
 RISKS THAT RELATE TO OPERATIONAL FACTORS 
 
 The Company s ability to meet its customers natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner. 
 
 In order to meet their customers annual and seasonal natural gas demands, the Utilities must obtain sufficient supplies, interstate pipeline capacity, and storage capacity. If they are unable to obtain these, either from their suppliers inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, to the extent not mitigated by tariffs, contractual indemnification or insurance, the Utilities financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If a substantial disruption in interstate natural gas pipelines transmission and storage capacity were to occur during periods of heavy demand, the Utilities financial results could be adversely impacted. 
 
 Spire Marketing s ability to deliver natural gas to its customers is contingent upon the performance of its suppliers and capability of pipeline and storage operators to fulfill delivery obligations to Spire Marketing under firm contracts. To the extent that it is unable to obtain the necessary supplies, Spire Marketing s financial position and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 
 
 Midstream is dependent upon third-party pipelines and other facilities to provide delivery options to and from its facilities. If any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, the ability to continue receiving or delivering natural gas could be restricted, and to the extent not mitigated by contractual indemnification, insurance or tariffs, would thereby reduce its revenues. Any permanent interruption that causes a material reduction in volumes could result in an impairment loss that could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations.

Transporting, distributing, and storing natural gas and propane involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks. 
 
 Natural gas transportation, distribution and storage activities inherently involve a variety of integrity issues, hazards and operations risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, blowouts, damage caused by third parties, activities of contractors, and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to the Company and its subsidiaries. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Similar risks also exist for Spire Missouri s propane storage, transmission and minor distribution operations. These activities may subject the Company to litigation or administrative proceedings. Such litigation or proceedings could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, penalties, business interruption or other enforcement actions against the Company and its subsidiaries or be resolved on unfavorable terms. In accordance with customary industry practices, the Utilities and other Spire businesses maintain insurance against a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent the occurrence of any of these events is self-insured or not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Because of competition, the Company may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, or may be unsuccessful in retaining or acquiring contractual assets on favorable terms, which could have an adverse impact on its business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The Utilities face the risk that larger commercial or industrial customers may bypass gas distribution services by directly connecting with interstate pipelines or, in the case of Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf, also from municipally or publicly owned gas distributors located adjacent to its service territory. The Utilities cannot provide any assurance that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 The Utilities compete with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full-service distributors to those offering delivery only. The Utilities also compete for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products, principally propane and electricity, and to a growing extent, distributed sources of renewable energy. If they are unable to compete effectively, the Utilities may lose existing customers and/or fail to acquire new customers, which in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations and financial condition. Along those lines, changes in wholesale natural gas prices compared with prices for electricity, fuel oil, coal, propane, or other energy sources can significantly impact the cost of delivered natural gas, which may affect the Utilities retention of natural gas customers and may adversely impact their financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Spire Storage is subject to competition from similar services provided by pipelines and from competing independent storage providers capable of serving its customers. Natural gas storage is a competitive business, with competitors having the ability to expand storage capacity. Increased competition in the natural gas storage business could reduce the demand and drive rates down for the Company s natural gas storage services. 
 
 Also, Spire Marketing profitability may be impacted by the effects of the expiration, in the normal course of business, of certain of its natural gas supply, sales, transportation and storage contracts if, because of competition or other reasons, those contracts cannot be replaced and/or renewed with arrangements with similar terms and pricing. 
 
 Significantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions and the effects of climate change may affect the Utilities sale of heating energy and adversely impact their financial position and results of operations. 
 
 The Utilities earnings are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. Spire Missouri and Spire Mississippi each have a Weather Normalization Adjustment rider, Spire Alabama has a Temperature Adjustment Rider, and Spire Gulf has a Weather Impact Normalization Factor. These mechanisms, approved by the respective state regulatory body, provide better assurance of the recovery of fixed costs and margins during winter months despite variations in sales volumes due to the impacts of weather, while the annual rate designs of Alabama and Mississippi help adjust for other factors that affect customer usage. However, significantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions in the Utilities service areas and other factors, such as climate change, alternative energy sources and increased efficiency of gas furnaces and other appliances, may result in reduced profitability and decreased cash flows attributable to lower gas sales. Furthermore, these mechanisms do not fully mitigate the impact of warmer weather and continuation of these adjustment factors is subject to regulatory discretion.

To the extent climate change results in warmer temperatures, financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues and reduced marketing opportunities. Management believes it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. Another possible impact of climate change may be more frequent and more severe weather events, such as significant wind or flooding events, which could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers or result in lost revenues if the Company were unable to deliver natural gas to customers. Such weather events could also disrupt our usual gas supplies and make it impossible or extremely costly to find replacement gas for our customers. To the extent such impacts are self-insured, or not covered by insurance or recovered in rates, the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company s natural gas storage business includes inherent geologic and operational risks. 
 
 The Company plans to continue to increase capacity, improve operating performance, and improve the integrity of its storage fields and associated above-ground facilities of Spire Storage. Construction of such assets is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including supply chain and labor disruptions, weather conditions during construction, equipment failures and construction quality issues. Any such disruptions, as well as any negative effects from the risks discussed below, could result in an impairment of Spire's investment in the project, and such impairment could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 

Any damage to the Spire Storage facilities or pipelines, or lack of integrity to its storage fields, including damages caused by a blow-out, to the extent such impacts are self-insured or not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.

The Company does not own all the land on which its storage facilities were constructed, and it is, therefore, subject to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to retain necessary land use, if and when applicable property rights expire or are renewed. Changes in the terms of such land use could have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company s storage business. 
 
 Increased dependence on technology may hinder the Company s business operations and adversely affect their financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail. 
 
 The Company has implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both Company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties. These tools and systems support critical functions including the Company s integrated planning, scheduling and dispatching of field resources, its automated meter reading system, customer care and billing, procurement and accounts payable, operational plant logistics, management reporting, and external financial reporting. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or the Company s inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder its business operations and, to the extent such impacts are self-insured or not covered by insurance, could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Although the Company has, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into its computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance these efforts to date would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies or the Company s use of such technologies. While the Company assesses the cyber protection of its vendors, the Company s use of an outside party presents a cyber exposure that must also be carefully managed. 
 
 A cyberattack may disrupt the Company s operations or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability. 
 
 The Company is subject to cybersecurity risks primarily related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer, employee, and vendor information maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries, or its third-party vendors in the normal course of business, as well as breaches in the technology that manages natural gas supply and control operations and other business processes. A loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of technology for operations or business processes could adversely affect the Company s reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, and subject the Company to possible financial liability, any of which could have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations. Despite Company policy restrictions on artificial intelligence (AI), whitelisting of sites, and contractual limitations on vendors use of AI, there is also a risk of inadvertent sharing of confidential or proprietary data through the inappropriate use of open AI tools.

The Company acknowledges increased dependence on technology increases its exposure to cyberattack. The Company closely monitors both preventive and detective measures to manage these risks and maintain cyber risk insurance to mitigate a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these cyber events is self-insured or not covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. On July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted its final rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance and Incident Disclosure to provide investors information on how public companies manage their cyber risks (see Item 1C) and to require timely disclosure of material cyber events, which increases compliance risk. 
 
 The Company s business activities are concentrated in a few states and regions . 
 
 The Utilities provide natural gas distribution services to customers in Alabama, Mississippi, and Missouri. Midstream is focused on the Rocky Mountain/Western and Midcontinent regions. Changes in the regional economies, politics, regulations and weather patterns of these states could negatively impact growth opportunities and the usage patterns and financial condition of customers and could adversely affect earnings, cash flows, and financial position. 
 
 RISKS THAT RELATE TO FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS 
 
 As a holding company, Spire depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations. 
 
 Spire is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its operating subsidiaries and cash investments. Spire, and Spire Missouri prior to the holding company s formation in 2000, has paid common stock dividends continuously since 1946. Spire s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to pay upstream dividends and make loans or loan repayments. 
 
 A downgrade in Spire s and/or its subsidiaries credit ratings and/or reduced access to credit and capital markets may negatively affect its cost of capital or prevent it from executing operating strategies. 
 
 Currently, Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama have investment-grade credit ratings. There is no assurance such credit ratings for any of these companies will remain in effect for any given period of time or such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Spire has a working capital line of credit to meet its short-term liquidity needs. Spire s line of credit may be used to meet the liquidity needs of any of its subsidiaries, subject to sublimits. If the rating agencies lowered the credit rating at any of these entities, particularly below investment grade, it might significantly limit that entity s ability to secure new or additional credit facilities and would increase its costs of borrowing. Spire s and the Utilities ability to borrow under current or new credit facilities and costs of that borrowing have a direct impact on their ability to execute their operating strategies. 
 
 Spire Marketing relies on its cash flows, ability to effect net settlements with counterparties, parental guaranties, and access to Spire s liquidity resources to satisfy its credit and working capital requirements. Spire Marketing s ability to rely on parental guaranties is dependent upon Spire s financial condition and credit ratings. If Spire s credit ratings were lowered, particularly below investment grade, counterparty acceptance of parental guaranties may diminish, resulting in decreased availability of credit. Additionally, under such circumstances, certain counterparties may require Spire Marketing to provide prepayments or cash deposits, amounts of which would be dependent upon natural gas market conditions. Reduced access to credit or increased credit requirements, which may also be caused by factors such as higher overall natural gas prices, may limit Spire Marketing s ability to enter into certain transactions. In addition, Spire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with (or are associated with) utility companies and their marketing affiliates. The concentration of counterparties ha s the potential to affect the Company s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers in this group may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk in certain individually significant counterparties. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations.

Regional supply/demand imbalances, fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices, changes in the terms and rates charged by midstream facilities, and infrastructure projects may adversely impact the future profitability of the Company. 
 
 Competition in the marketplace and fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices have a direct impact on Spire Marketing. Changing market conditions and prices, the narrowing of regional and seasonal price differentials and limited future price volatility may adversely impact its sales margins or affect its ability to procure gas supplies and/or to serve certain customers, which may reduce sales profitability and/or increase certain credit requirements caused by reductions in netting capability. Although the FERC regulates the interstate transportation of natural gas and establishes the general terms and conditions under which Spire Marketing may use interstate gas pipeline capacity to purchase and transport natural gas, Spire Marketing must occasionally renegotiate its transportation agreements with a concentrated group of pipeline companies. Renegotiated terms of new agreements, or increases in FERC-authorized rates of existing agreements, may impact Spire Marketing s future profitability. Profitability may also be adversely impacted if pipeline capacity or future storage capacity secured is not fully utilized. 
 
 Storage businesses are affected by various gas market fundamentals which impact the level of demand for storage services and the rates that can be charged for these services. These market fundamentals include: seasonal price spread; monthly, daily and hourly price volatility; locational basis for pricing points on pipelines connected to a storage facility; seasonal, daily and hourly weather; and operational impacts in supply and market areas served by a storage facility and its connected pipelines. These fundamentals have varying and potentially material adverse impacts on the various services offered by storage facilities and the rates that can be charged for these services in the market. These services include long-term firm storage, short-term park and loan, wheeling, and optimization. Rates below the variable costs to operate a storage facility could result in a decision to not operate all the capacity in the facility or to operate the facility at a loss if required to fulfill firm customer contract obligations. A sustained decline in these rates or a shut-in of all or a portion of one or more facilities capacity could have an adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s income from off-system sales and capacity release is subject to fluctuations in market conditions and changing supply and demand conditions in areas the Utilities hold pipeline capacity rights. Specific factors impacting the Utilities income from off-system sales and capacity release include the availability of attractively priced natural gas supply, availability of pipeline capacity, and market demand. Income from off-system sales and capacity release is shared with customers. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are allowed to retain 25 of the net margins achieved as a result of such off-system sales and capacity release. The Utilities ability to retain such income in the future is also subject to regulatory discretion. 
 
 Rapid significant increases in natural gas prices may adversely affect the Utilities liquidity and, in certain circumstances, results of operations. 
 
 The tariff rate schedules of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi contain Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses and Spire Alabama s tariff rate schedule contains a Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider that permit the Utilities to file for rate adjustments to recover the cost of purchased gas. Changes in the cost of purchased gas are flowed through to customers and may affect uncollectible amounts and cash flows and can therefore impact the amount of capital resources. 
 
 Currently, Spire Missouri is allowed to adjust the gas cost component of rates up to four times each year while Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf (collectively, the Alabama Utilities and Spire Mississippi may adjust the gas cost component of their rates on a monthly basis. Spire Missouri must make a mandatory gas cost adjustment at the beginning of the winter, in November, and during the next twelve months may make up to three additional discretionary gas cost adjustments, so long as each of these adjustments is separated by at least two months. 
 
 The MoPSC typically approves the Spire Missouri PGA changes on an interim basis, subject to refund and the outcome of a subsequent audit and prudence review. Due to such review process, there is a risk of a disallowance of full recovery of these costs. Any material disallowance of purchased gas costs would adversely affect results of operations. The Alabama Utilities gas supply charges are submitted for APSC review on a monthly basis, regardless of whether there is a request for a change, so prudence review occurs on an ongoing basis. Spire Mississippi s PGA is adjusted on a monthly basis for the most recent charges and is filed at the MSPSC on a monthly basis.

Table of Contents 

Increases in the prices the Utilities charge for gas may also adversely affect revenues because they could lead customers to reduce usage and cause some customers to have trouble paying the resulting higher bills. These higher prices may increase bad debt expenses and ultimately reduce earnings. Rapid increases in the price of purchased gas may result in an increase in short-term debt. 
 
 To lower financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations, Spire Missouri enters into contracts to hedge the forward commodity price of its natural gas supplies. As part of this strategy, Spire Missouri may use fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, swaps, futures, and option contracts. However, Spire Missouri does not hedge the entire exposure of energy assets or positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Any costs, gains, or losses experienced through hedging procedures, including carrying costs, generally flow through the PGA clause, thereby limiting Spire Missouri s exposure to earnings volatility. However, variations in the timing of collections of such gas costs under the PGA clause and the effect of cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri s use of natural gas derivative instruments may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. These procedures remain subject to prudence review by the MoPSC. 
 
 Other than fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf, and Spire Mississippi currently do not utilize risk mitigation strategies that incorporate commodity hedge instruments, but Spire Alabama has the ability to do so through its GSA. 
 
 Risk management policies, including the use of derivative instruments, may not fully protect Spire Marketing s sales and results of operations from volatility and may result in financial losses. 
 
 In the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments. 
 
 Spire Marketing currently manages the commodity price risk associated with fixed-price commitments for the purchase or sale of natural gas by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. and/or the Intercontinental Exchange to lock in margins. These exchange-traded/cleared contracts may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. However, market conditions and regional price changes may cause ineffective portions of matched positions to result in financial losses. Additionally, to the extent that Spire Marketing s natural gas contracts are classified as trading activities or do not otherwise qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales designation (or the designation is not elected), the contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value each period. Accordingly, the associated gains and losses are reported directly in earnings and may cause volatility in results of operations. Gains or losses (realized and unrealized) on certain wholesale purchase and sale contracts, consisting of those classified as trading activities, are required to be presented on a net basis (instead of a gross basis) in the statements of consolidated income. Such presentation could result in volatility in the Company s operating revenues. 
 
 Spire s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to investment and interest rate risk that could negatively impact its financial condition. 
 
 Spire and its subsidiaries have pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide benefits to many of their employees and retirees. Costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plans. The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in the Company s financial statements are affected by various factors, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, including economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies and demographics. Recessions and volatility in the domestic and international financial markets have negatively affected the asset values of the Company s pension plans at various times in the past. Poor investment returns or lower interest rates may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements, which could have an adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. For more information, including regulatory provisions affecting the Utilities plans, see Note 13 , Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.

In connection with acquisitions, Spire and Spire Missouri recorded goodwill and long-lived assets that could become impaired and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Spire and Spire Missouri assess goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company and Spire Missouri assess their long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets becomes impaired, the Company and Spire Missouri may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on their results of operations. 
 
 Since interest rates are a key component, among other assumptions, in the models used to estimate the fair values of the Company s reporting units, rises in interest rates would generally decrease the calculated fair values and future impairments may occur. Due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analysis, Spire and Spire Missouri cannot provide assurance that future analyses will not result in impairment. These assumptions and estimates include projected cash flows, current and future rates for contracted capacity, growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and market multiples. 
 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 
 Resources expended to pursue or integrate business acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements may adversely affect Spire s financial position and results of operations and return on investments made may not meet the Company s expectations. 
 
 From time to time, Spire may seek to grow through strategic acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements. Attractive acquisition and investment opportunities may be difficult to complete on economically acceptable terms. It is possible for Spire to expend considerable resources pursuing acquisitions and investments that for a variety of reasons do not move forward. Similarly, investment opportunities may be hindered or halted by regulatory or legal actions. To the extent acquisitions or investments are made, such transactions involve a number of risks, including but not limited to, the assumption of material liabilities, the diversion of management s attention from daily operations, difficulties in assimilation and retention of employees, securing adequate capital to support the transaction, and obtaining regulatory approval. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets and there is a possibility that anticipated operating and financial efficiencies expected to result from an acquisition or investment do not develop. Additionally, there are no assurances resources expended will achieve their intended result. 
 
 The failure to complete an acquisition successfully or to integrate acquisitions or investments it may undertake could have an adverse effect on the Spire s financial condition and results of operations and the market s perception of the Company s execution of its strategy. To the extent Spire engages in any of the above activities together with or through one or more of its subsidiaries, including the Utilities, such subsidiaries may face the same risks. 
 
 Unexpected losses may adversely affect Spire s or its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 As with most businesses, there are operations and business risks inherent in the activities of Spire s subsidiaries or even the activities of its vendors. If, in the normal course of business, Spire or any of its subsidiaries becomes a party to litigation, such litigation could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, penalties, business interruption or other enforcement actions or be resolved on unfavorable terms. In accordance with customary practice, Spire and its subsidiaries secure strong contractual indemnification requirements where available and maintain insurance against a significant portion of, but not all, risks and losses , though it does reinsure a portion of the risk from certain of Spire s insurers through its captive insurance company. Spire and its operating companies employ many strategies to gain assurance such risks are appropriately managed, mitigated, or insured, as appropriate. To the extent a loss is self-insured or not fully covered by insurance or other risk mitigation strategies, that loss could adversely affect Spire s and/or its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations.

Catastrophic events may adversely affect the Company s facilities and operations. 
 
 Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms, winter storms, terrorist acts, acts of civil unrest, pandemic illnesses or other similar occurrences could adversely affect the Utilities facilities and operations, as well as those of Midstream. Emergency planning and training programs are in place to respond to events that could cause business interruptions ; however, unanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact. To the extent the impacts of such catastrophic events are not covered by insurance or recovered in rates, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Workforce risks may affect the Company s financial results. 
 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various workforce risks, including, but not limited to, the risk that it will be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel; that it will be unable to effectively transfer to new personnel the knowledge and expertise of an aging workforce as those workers retire; and that it will be unable to reach collective bargaining arrangements with the unions that represent certain of its workers, which could result in work stoppages. 
 
 The Company may be adversely affected by economic conditions. 
 
 Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased energy consumption, particularly by industrial and large commercial companies, a loss of existing customers, and fewer new customers. As a consequence, national or regional recessions or other downturns in economic activity could adversely affect revenues and cash flows or restrict future growth. Economic conditions in the Utilities service territories may also adversely impact the Utilities ability to collect accounts receivable, resulting in an increase in bad debt expense. 
 
 Changes in accounting standards may adversely impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Spire and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), SEC regulations and other interpretations of financial reporting requirements for public utilities. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial condition or results of operations nor the timing of such changes. The potential issues associated with rate-regulated accounting, along with other potential changes to GAAP that the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) continues to consider may be significant.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 
 Managing risk related to cybersecurity is a top priority for Spire, and the Company remains focused on addressing threats that would jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity and availability of stakeholders information or the ability to continue providing safe and reliable service to customers. To date, Spire has not experienced any material cybersecurity breach that impacts the Company s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 
 Risk Management 
 
 Enterprise risk management (ERM) at Spire oversees significant risks to the Company s ability to successfully execute on strategy and achieve corporate objectives. Spire s ERM is based on a structured, comprehensive process that leverages ISO 31000:2018, adopted and customized to the Company s needs, utilizing an ongoing process of risk identification, evaluation, treatment, integration and monitoring. ERM helps assess priorities and facilitate decision-making for resource allocation as it relates to risk management. Two risks prioritized by our Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee related to cybersecurity are cyber threats and vendor management. Additionally, the ERM process is structured to integrate with operational levels, where risk is managed, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 utilized by the Company s Information Security function for managing cybersecurity. 
 
 Governance 
 
 Spire s Board of Directors Board recognizes the significance of cybersecurity risk and has therefore retained oversight of cybersecurity rather than delegating this risk to a committee of the Board. Every regular meeting of the Board includes a cybersecurity report provided by the Company s Chief Information Officer and the Managing Director of Information Security. These reports focus on developments within the Company s cybersecurity program and provide an update on any cybersecurity events or concerns. The Board recently added a new director with expertise in cybersecurity to assist the Board to appropriately oversee the Company s efforts. 
 
 Spire s cybersecurity program is led by the Chief Information Officer and the Managing Director of Information Security, who together have over 40 years of experience in information technology and cybersecurity, along with a cross-functional team of technology, legal, physical security and risk leaders. Internal Audit provides assurances of risk management activities, including certain third-party cybersecurity activities, such as penetration testing. 
 
 Strategy/Approach 
 
 Spire s cybersecurity team developed a five-year strategic roadmap in 2020, which is reviewed and updated annually. A NIST-based maturity assessment is also conducted annually to assess Spire s current maturity level and is used to establish initiatives to drive capabilities in key focus areas. Such initiatives were updated to align with federal security directives issued in 2021, with a key focus on increasing overall visibility into the environment to better correlate potential security related items; completing segregation and dependency from the enterprise and industrial control systems environments; and establishing defined policies and procedures to enhance overall governance and risk management. 
 
 In addition to these strategic efforts, the Company works closely with federal agencies, including the U.S Department of Homeland Security, TSA and the local FBI chapter, and is actively involved in industry information sharing groups. 
 
 The Company s cybersecurity function is staffed with dedicated professionals who continuously monitor risks and evaluate the resiliency and effectiveness of the architecture and defenses within Spire s systems. The Company also maintains policies, procedures and standards to manage conduct within Spire and to be prepared for new cybersecurity threats and events. The cybersecurity program involves a variety of training and education to increase awareness of cybersecurity threats through mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees, quarterly phishing campaigns, and table-top exercises. The Company also engages third parties to evaluate potential risks through external penetration testing to assess the efficacy of systems. 
 
 Spire maintains business continuity plans to guide the Company s response to a potential cybersecurity event. These plans are regularly reviewed, tested and updated to ensure they meet the evolving needs of the Company in this area. The Company also conducts annual disaster recovery exercises to test the efficacy of core systems in the event of a catastrophic incident.

NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 
 Net income, earnings per share and operating income reported by Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are determined in accordance with GAAP. Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama also provide the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share and contribution margin. Management and the Board of Directors use non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting, to determine incentive compensation and to evaluate financial performance. These non-GAAP operating metrics should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, the related GAAP measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages. 
 
 Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share 
 
 Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share were formerly known as net economic earnings and net economic earnings per share. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude from net income, as applicable, the impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions, the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and restructuring activities, and the largely non-cash impacts of impairments and other non-recurring or unusual items such as certain regulatory, legislative or GAAP standard-setting actions. In addition, adjusted earnings per share would exclude the impact, in the fiscal year of issuance, of any shares issued to finance acquisitions that have yet to be included in adjusted earnings. 
 
 The fair value and timing adjustments are made in instances where the accounting treatment differs from what management considers the economic substance of the underlying transaction, including the following: 

Net unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives that are required by GAAP fair value accounting associated with current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. These unrealized gains and losses result primarily from two sources: 

1) 
 changes in the fair values of physical and/or financial derivatives prior to the period of settlement; and 

2) 
 ineffective portions of accounting hedges, required to be recorded in earnings prior to settlement, due to differences in commodity price changes between the locations of the forecasted physical purchase or sale transactions and the locations of the underlying hedge instruments; 

Lower of cost or market adjustments to the carrying value of commodity inventories resulting when the net realizable value of the commodity falls below its original cost, to the extent that those commodities are economically hedged; and 

Realized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of economic hedges prior to the sale of the physical commodity. 

These adjustments eliminate the impact of timing differences and the impact of current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in each period until being replaced with the actual gains or losses realized when the associated physical transactions occur. Management believes that excluding the earnings volatility caused by recognizing changes in fair value prior to settlement and other timing differences associated with related purchase and sale transactions provides a useful representation of the economic effects of only the actual settled transactions and their effects on results of operations. While management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate all of its businesses, the net effect of these fair value and timing adjustments on the Utilities earnings is minimal because gains or losses on their natural gas derivative instruments are deferred pursuant to state regulation. 
 
 Contribution Margin 
 
 In addition to operating revenues and operating expenses, management also uses the non-GAAP measure of contribution margin when evaluating results of operations. Contribution margin is defined as operating revenues less natural gas costs and gross receipts tax expense. The Utilities pass to their customers (subject to prudence review by, as applicable, the MoPSC, APSC or MSPSC) increases and decreases in the wholesale cost of natural gas in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders. The volatility of the wholesale natural gas market results in fluctuations from period to period in the recorded levels of, among other items, revenues and natural gas cost expense. Nevertheless, increases and decreases in the cost of gas associated with system gas sales volumes and gross receipts tax expense (which are calculated as a percentage of revenues), with the same amount (excluding immaterial timing differences) included in revenues, have no direct effect on operating income. Therefore, management believes that contribution margin is a useful supplemental measure, along with the remaining operating expenses, for assessing the Company s and the Utilities performance.

19.9 

The increase in interest expense was principally the result of higher interest expenses on short-term borrowings, reflecting both higher short-term interest rates and higher average borrowing levels in the current year. Interest on long-term debt was marginally higher, reflecting higher average debt levels and slightly higher rates. Weighted-average short-term interest rates were 5.7 in the current year versus 5.0 in the prior year, while weighted average interest rate on long-term debt increased from 4.2 in the prior year to 4.3 in the current year. 
 
 Other income decreased 1.0. Removing the i mpact of the Postretirement Non-Service Cost Transfer (NSC Transfer) of 7.5, the increase was 6.5. Of this increase, 8.2 was t he result of a gain realized on an interest rate swap contract after management determined the anticipated issuance of certain debt was no longer probable of occurring, resulting in the discontinuation of hedge accounting. This gain, combined with favorable mark-to-market valuations on unqualified retirement and investment trusts was only partly offset by lower gas carrying cost credits at Spire Missouri. 
 
 Income tax expense increased 19.9, the result of higher pre-tax income in the current year and the prior year benefiting from a one-time tax credit study. 
 
 Gas Utility 
 
 For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, Gas Utility adjusted earnings in the current year was 20.3 higher than the prior-year period with higher earnings across both Missouri and Alabama. Net income in the current year was 16.5 higher than the prior year, reflecting the current-year s 3.8 (after-tax) expense relating to the Company s customer affordability initiative (an initiative implemented in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to improve long-term customer affordability targeted at lowering our overall cost structure and improving operational efficiency) that is excluded from adjusted earnings. These results are described in further detail below. 
 
 The decrease in Gas Utility operating revenues for fiscal 2024 was attributable to the following factors: 

Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama Lower PGA/GSA gas cost recoveries 

(89.2) 

Spire Missouri Volumetric usage including weather mitigation impact 

(10.1) 

Spire Alabama Per customer usage charge reset, combined with warm weather adjustment

9.8 

Spire Missouri Off-system sales and capacity release 

8.9 

All other factors 

(3.8) 

Total Variation 

(19.0) 

Warmer weather across our utility footprint in the current year negatively impacted both gas cost recoveries and customer usage, particularly for Spire Missouri. Spire Missouri realized 65.7 lower gas cost recoveries in the current year, as the current-year lower volumes more than offset the higher PGA rates being charged to customers. Spire Missouri also experienced lower volumetric usage totaling 10.1 in the current year. 

32

Table of Contents 

These warmer weather impacts more than offset the 23.3 incremental revenues resulting from the reset of the Spire Alabama per customer usage charge (net of weather adjustment), 22.9 increase from Spire Missouri reflecting the full year impact of implementing the 2022 rate order, favorable Spire Alabama RSE adjustments totaling 9.8, and increases in ISRS and off-system sales of 19.2 and 8.9, respectively, at Spire Missouri. 
 
 The year-over-year increase in Gas Utility contribution margin was attributable to the following factors: 

Spire Missouri 2022 rate case outcomes

Total Variation 

63.4 

Contribution margin increased 63.4 versus the prior year. Favorable drivers included the 22.9 increase attributable to the implementation of the 2022 Missouri rate case order, increase in ISRS of 19.2, 11.8 growth resulting from the reset of the Spire Alabama per customer usage charge (net of weather adjustment), and 9.9 favorable RSE adjustment at Spire Alabama. These factors were partially offset by the 11.2 negative volume usage impact (net of weather mitigation) experienced by Spire Missouri in the current year. 
 
 Reported O M expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 were 9.0 lower than the prior year. After excluding the impact of the NSC Transfer of 7.5 expenses declined 1.5. Excluding the 5.0 expenses in the current year relating to the Company s customer affordability initiative, the Gas Utility segment O M decreased 6.5. This reduction reflected lower operations expense, lower employee-related costs and reductions in outside service costs, partially offset by increases in insurance costs and bad debt expense. 
 
 Taxes, other than income taxes, decreased 0.1, as lower gross receipts taxes totaling 3.5 offset increases in property and real estate taxes. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 were 19.2 higher than the same period in the prior year primarily driven by continued infrastructure capital expenditures across all the Utilities. Interest expense increased 7.4 to 147.3 reflecting higher average net debt levels and higher short-term interest rates. Other income decreased 10.5. in the current year 3.0 after removing the 7.5 NSC Transfer impact), primarily the result of lower gas carrying credits at Spire Missouri that were only partly offset by favorable mark-to-market valuations on unqualified retirement trusts. 
 
 Gas Marketing 
 
 The 24.2 year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings primarily reflects very favorable market conditions in the prior year that did not recur this year. The smaller decline in net income reflects the inclusion of 17.8 (after-tax) favorable mark-to-market activity. 
 
 Revenues in the current year decreased 79.9 and contribution margin decreased 32.8 (after removing the 23.8 pre-tax favorable mark-to-market activity) versus the prior-year period, reflecting the lower current-year asset optimization opportunities versus the market conditions in the prior year. Operating expenses decreased by 1.2 year-over-year, primarily due to lower employee-related costs. 
 
 Midstream 
 
 Adjusted earnings and net income for the Company s Midstream segment increased 19.4 and 19.7, respectively from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher storage earnings, reflecting additional capacity and contract renewals at higher rates at Spire Storage West and higher contracted rates at Spire Storage Salt Plains effective during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Revenues in the current year increased 34.6 versus the prior-year period, due primarily to the acquisitions of Spire Storage Salt Plains and MoGas and increased Spire Storage West revenues attributable primarily to the previously mentioned new capacity and rates in the third quarter of the current year. O M expenses increased by 4.2 year-over-year, due primarily to operating expenses associated with the before-mentioned acquisitions, combined with increased activity at Spire Storage West.

Table of Contents 

Other 
 
 The Company s other activities generated a 30.3 adjusted loss in the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, 3.8 lower than the prior-year period. The improved results were driven by the current-year 8.2 gain realized on an interest rate swap contract after management determined the anticipated issuance of certain debt was no longer probable of occurring considering changes in debt issuance strategy due to the interest rate environment, resulting in the discontinuation of hedge accounting. This gain, combined with lower corporate costs in the current year more than offset higher interest expense.

Operating revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 were 25.5 lower than the comparable prior-year period. A key driver was a decrease in gas recovery (PGA) totaling 65.7 that was only partially offset by higher new rates of 42.1. New rates reflect an increase of 22.9 attributable to the impact of the 2022 rate order (new rates became effective the last week of December 2022) and 19.2 higher ISRS in the current year. The new rates, combined with higher off-system sales were more than offset by lower volume impacts (net of weather mitigation) totaling 10.1. 
 
 Temperatures in Spire Missouri s service areas during fiscal 2024 were 10.0 warmer than during fiscal 2023 and 19.1 warmer than normal. The Spire Missouri total system volume sold and transported was 1,469.2 million centum of cubic feet (CCF) for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1,592.0 million CCF last year. Total off-system volume sold and transported was 38.2 million CCF for fiscal 2024, compared with 14.5 million for fiscal 2023. 
 
 Contribution margin for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 increased 35.3 from the same period in the prior year. The previously mentioned timing of the 2022 rate case implementation generated 22.9 incremental contribution combined with 19.2 higher ISRS more than offset the 11.2 impact of lower volumes. 
 
 Reported O M expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 8.8 versus the prior year, or 0.5 after removing the 8.3 impact of the NSC Transfer. Excluding the 3.6 of charges in the current year relating to the Company s customer affordability initiative, O M expenses are 4.1 lower than the comparable prior-year period. This reduction of current year O M was driven by non-payroll operations expense, lower employee-related costs and lower outside services costs, partially offset by higher insurance and bad debt expenses. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were up 15.3, the result of continued investment in infrastructure upgrades. Taxes, other than income taxes, increased 0.2, as higher real estate/property taxes were not totally offset by 3.6 lower pass-through gross receipts taxes in the current year. 
 
 Reported other income decreased 11.0, or 2.7 after removing the 8.3 impact of the NSC Transfer. Lower gas carrying cost credits were not totally offset by favorable mark-to-market valuations on unqualified retirement trusts. Interest expense increased 9.0, reflecting higher short-term interest rates in the current year, and higher average long-term interest rates that more than offset the benefit of slightly lower average long-term debt balances in the current year. 
 
 Resulting net income for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.9 favorable versus the prior-year comparable period. Adjusted earnings increased 3.7 after removing expenses primarily related to the current year customer affordability initiative.

Operating revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7.8 from the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating revenue was principally due to the 23.3 impact of the current year customer usage charge reset net of weather adjustments, combined with favorable RSE adjustments of 9.8. These favorable impacts were only partly offset by a 23.5 decrease in gas cost recovery and a 1.7 reduction in Off System Sales. 
 
 Temperatures in Spire Alabama s service area during fiscal 2024 were 12.8 colder than during fiscal 2023 and 9.0 warmer than normal. Spire Alabama s total system volume sold and transported was 1,036.7 million CCF during the year ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1,026.2 million CCF during the prior year. Off-system sales volume for fiscal 2024 totaled 90.9 million CCF compared with 98.8 million CCF for fiscal 2023. 
 
 Contribution margin was 20.8 higher versus the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven higher by 11.8 relating to the customer usage charge reset (net of weather adjustments) and 9.9 favorable net rate adjustments under the RSE mechanism, slightly offset by a 0.6 decrease attributable to lower off-system sales. 
 
 O M expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.8 lower versus the comparable prior-year period. Lower employee-related costs and lower non-employee operating expenses were mostly offset by the current year 1.0 charge relating to the Company s customer affordability initiative combined with higher bad debt expense. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were up 3.5, the result of continued investment in infrastructure upgrades. Interest expense for the current-year period decreased 1.8 versus the prior-year period, as lower average levels of short-term debt more than offset higher short-term interest rates. 
 
 For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, resulting net income increased 14.1 versus the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings, which removes the customer affordability initiative charge in the current year, increased 14.9.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased 472.2 from 2023 to 2024 after increasing 385.2 from 2022 to 2023. In addition to the changes in net income between the respective periods (discussed in the Earnings section above), the remaining changes were related to regulatory timing and fluctuations in working capital items, as discussed below in the Future Cash Requirements section. Specifically, the timing and amounts of regulatory adjustments for purchased gas costs resulted in a large change in deferred recovery in 2022 and 2024, greatly reducing net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 and increasing it in 2024. 

35

Table of Contents 

In 2024, the Company's net cash used in investing activities was 331.7 more than in 2023, primarily driven by a 198.8 increase in capital expenditures and a 138.9 increase in business acquisitions (MoGas in 2024 relative to Spire Storage Salt Plains in 2023). Capital expenditures increased 102.5 in the Gas Utility segment (primarily due to continued meter and other infrastructure upgrades) and 97.7 in the Midstream segment (primarily due to the ongoing Wyoming storage facility expansion). 
 
 In 2023, the Company used 148.8 more cash in investing activities than in 2022, primarily driven by a 110.3 increase in capital expenditures and the 37.0 acquisition of Spire Storage Salt Plains. Capital expenditures increased 60.0 in the Gas Utility segment (primarily due to ramp up of meter and other infrastructure upgrades) and 51.0 in the Midstream segment (primarily due to the start of the Wyoming storage facility expansion). 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was down 136.7 in 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of lower net debt issuances and higher dividends, partially offset by higher common stock issuances. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was down 240.3 in 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of lower net debt issuances, lower common stock issuances, and higher dividends. Although the net increase in long-term debt was 473.8 in fiscal 2023 compared to only 244.2 in fiscal 2022, Spire reduced short-term debt by 82.0 in fiscal 2023 after increasing short-term borrowings 365.5 in 2022. 
 
 Future Cash Requirements 
 
 The Company s short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when the Utilities borrow money to cover the lag between when they purchase natural gas and when their customers pay for that gas. Changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas (including cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri s use of natural gas derivative instruments), variations in the timing of collections of gas cost under the Utilities PGA clauses and GSA riders, the seasonality of accounts receivable balances, and the utilization of stored gas inventories cause short-term cash requirements to vary during the year and from year to year, and may cause significant variations in the Company s cash provided by or used in operating activities. 
 
 Spire s material cash requirements as of September 30, 2024, are related to capital expenditures, principal and interest payments on long-term debt, natural gas purchase obligations, and common and preferred stock dividends. 
 
 Total Company capital expenditures are planned to be 790 for fiscal 2025 (as the accelerated meter replacement program and storage facility expansion projects come to a close), though Spire had purchase commitments for only a fraction of these as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 As detailed in Note 6 , Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8, 42.0 of the total 3,771.1 principal amount is due in fiscal 2025. Using each long-term debt instrument s stated maturity and fixed rates or variable rates as of September 30, 2024, interest payments are projected to total 1,853.3, of which 165.1 is due in fiscal 2025. 
 
 Spire s natural gas purchase obligations totaled 1,529.5, including 567.0 for fiscal 2025, representing the minimum payments required under existing natural gas transportation and storage contracts and natural gas supply agreements. The amounts reflect fixed obligations as well as obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using forward market prices as of September 30, 2024. Each of the Utilities generally recovers costs related to its purchases, transportation and storage of natural gas through the operation of its PGA clause or GSA rider, subject to prudence review by the appropriate regional public service commission. Additional contractual commitments are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season. 
 
 Spire dividends declared and payable as of September 30, 2024, totaled 48.1, while annualized dividends based on the shares outstanding and regular quarterly amounts declared on November 14, 2024 are estimated at 196.1.

Source of Funds 
 
 The Utilities rely on short-term credit and long-term capital markets, as well as cash flows from operations, to satisfy their seasonal cash requirements and fund their capital expenditures. The Utilities access the commercial paper market through a program administered by the holding company, which then loans borrowed funds to the Utilities. The Utilities directly access the long-term bond market. In addition to its own operating cash flows, Spire Marketing relies on Spire s parental guaranties to secure its purchase and sales obligations of natural gas, and it also has access to Spire s liquidity resources. 
 
 The Company s, Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs, may depend not only on current conditions in the credit and capital markets but also on the credit rating of the entity that is accessing the capital markets. Their debt is rated by two rating agencies: Standard Poor s Corporation S P and Moody s Investors Service Moody s ). As of September 30, 2024, the debt ratings of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama (shown in the following table) remain at investment grade with a stable outlook.

Management focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and believes the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have adequate access to credit and capital markets and will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, to meet anticipated requirements. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 Bank deposits were used to support working capital needs of the business. Spire had no temporary cash investments as of September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 
 Short-term Debt 
 
 The Company s short-term cash requirements can be met through the sale of up to 1,500.0 of commercial paper or through the use of Spire's 1,500.0 revolving credit facility. For information about these resources, see Note 7 , Notes Payable and Credit Agreements, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 and Interest Rate Risk under Market Risk below. 
 
 Long-term Debt and Equity 
 
 Factoring in the current portion of long-term debt, the Company s long-term consolidated capitalization consisted of 46 equity at September 30, 2024 and 44 equity at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, Spire had outstanding principal of long-term debt totaling 3,771.1, of which 1,818.0 was issued by Spire Missouri, 750.0 was issued by Spire Alabama, and 223.1 was issued by other subsidiaries. Effective October 27, 2024, Spire Missouri was authorized by the MoPSC to issue conventional term loans, first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt, preferred stock and common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed 850.0 any time from that date through December 31, 2027. Spire Alabama has no standing authority to issue long-term debt and must petition the APSC for each planned issuance. 
 
 On August 13, 2024, Spire Missouri issued 320.0 aggregate principal amount of its 5.150 Series First Mortgage Bonds due 2034. Interest is payable semi-annually. The bonds senior secured indebtedness of Spire Missouri and rank equally with all other existing and future senior secured indebtedness issued by Spire Missouri under its mortgage and deed of trust. The bonds are secured by a first mortgage lien on substantially all of the real properties of Spire Missouri, subject to limited exceptions. Spire Missouri used most of the proceeds to redeem its First Mortgage Bonds, Floating Rate Series due December 2, 2024, in the aggregate principal amount of 300.0, on August 14, 2024.

Table of Contents 

In February 2021, Spire issued 3.5 million equity units, initially in the form of Corporate Units. Each Corporate Unit was comprised of (i) a purchase contract for a certain number of shares of the Company's common stock and (ii) an interest in the Company's 2021 Series A 0.75 Remarketable Senior Notes due 2026 with an aggregate principal amount of 175.0. In February 2024, Spire successfully remarketed those notes on behalf of the selling securityholders. As a result, the interest rate on that original 175.0 obligation was reset to 5.300 . Also in February 2024, Spire sold an additional 175.0 aggregate principal amount of the 5.300 Senior Notes due March 1, 2026, with interest payable semiannually, and Spire received net proceeds of 173.5 from this offering. The Corporate Unit holders purchased an aggregate of 2,745,733 shares of common stock (net of fractional shares) for 175.0, settled on March 5, 2024. 

Under Spire s at-the-market (ATM) equity distribution agreement and as authorized by its board of directors, the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock (including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to forward sale agreements entered into in connection with the ATM equity distribution agreement). Settled sales under this ATM program are included in Common stock issued in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. Specifically in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on December 11, 2023, 1,744,549 shares were settled, generating 112.2 of net proceeds. In the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, Spire executed forward sale agreements for 204,405 shares, 338,110 shares and 663,619 shares, respectively, set to be settled on or before December 31, 2024, March 10, 2025 and March 31, 2025, respectively, but no shares of common stock have been settled under these forward sale agreements. Had all shares under these forward agreements been settled as of September 30, 2024
 , it would have generated net proceeds of 75.0. As of September 30, 2024
 , under the ATM program, Spire may sell additional shares with an aggregate offering price of up to 123.6 through January 2027.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 
 The Utilities and other Spire subsidiaries own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Company s, Spire Missouri s or Spire Alabama s financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations and their interpretations change, however, the Company and the Utilities may be required to incur additional costs. For information relative to environmental matters, see Contingencies in Note 16 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 REGULATORY MATTERS 
 
 For discussions of regulatory matters for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama, see Note 15 , Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have evaluated recently issued accounting standards and concluded that none will have a material impact on their financial position or results of operations upon adoption.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our financial statements: 
 
 Regulatory Accounting The Utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, Regulated Operations . The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). Management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of these regulatory accounting principles and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. For Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, management believes the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance: 
 
 PGA Clause Spire Missouri s PGA clauses allows it to flow through to customers, subject to a prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including the costs, cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas. The difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period. The PGA clauses also permit the application of carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, and also provide for a portion of income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues to be flowed through to customers. 
 
 GSA Rider Spire Alabama s rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider, established in 1993, which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabama s tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA, that is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabama s earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. In prior years, Spire Alabama entered into cash flow derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on its gas supply. Spire Alabama recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Any realized gains or losses are passed through to customers using the mechanisms of the GSA rider in accordance with Spire Alabama s APSC approved tariff and are recognized as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. All derivative commodity instruments in a gain position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to each related counterparty. Derivative commodity instruments in a loss position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to Spire Alabama. Spire Alabama currently has no active gas supply derivative positions. 
 
 ISRS The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to upgrade its infrastructure and enhance its safety and reliability without the necessity of a formal rate case. Spire Missouri records ISRS revenues as authorized by the MoPSC and estimates the probability and amount of any refunds based on commission precedent, current legal rulings, the opinion of legal counsel, and other considerations.

Table of Contents 

Employee Benefits and Postretirement Obligations Pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions provided by management related to future events, such as discount rates, returns on plan assets, compensation increases, and mortality rates. For the Utilities, the amount of expense recognized and the amounts reflected in other comprehensive income are dependent upon the regulatory treatment provided for such costs, as discussed further below. Certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers compensation claims, portions of which are self-insured and/or contain stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit exposure, are established based on historical trends. 
 
 The amount of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs recognized in the financial statements related to the Utilities qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based upon allowances, as approved by the MoPSC (for Spire Missouri) and as approved by the APSC (for Spire Alabama). The allowances have been established in the rate-making process for the recovery of these costs from customers. The differences between these amounts and actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs incurred for financial reporting purposes are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. GAAP also requires that changes that affect the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans, but that are not yet required to be recognized as components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs, be reflected in other comprehensive income. For the Utilities qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, amounts that would otherwise be reflected in other comprehensive income are deferred with entries to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. 
 
 For more information, see Note 13 , Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.

Income Taxes Income tax calculations require estimates due to book-tax differences, estimates with respect to regulatory treatment of certain items, and uncertainty in the interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Critical assumptions and judgments also include projections of future taxable income to determine the ability to utilize net operating losses and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management regularly assesses financial statement tax provisions to identify any change in regulatory treatment or tax related estimates and assumptions that could have a material impact on cash flows, financial position and/or results of operations. For more information, see Note 12 , Income Taxes, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.

 MARKET RISK 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Gas Utility 
 
 The Utilities commodity price risk, which arises from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, is primarily managed through the operation of Spire Missouri s PGA clauses and Spire Alabama s GSA rider. The PGA clauses and GSA rider allows the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC and APSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies. Spire Missouri is allowed the flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months. Spire Missouri is able to mitigate, to some extent, changes in commodity prices through the use of physical storage supplies and regional supply diversity. Spire Alabama is allowed to make monthly changes to the GSA rate, but increases cannot exceed a 5 increase over the prior effective residential billing rate. The Utilities also have risk management policies that allow for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing its price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. These policies prohibit speculation. As of September 30, 2024, Spire Missouri had active natural gas derivative positions, but Spire Alabama did not. Costs and cost reduction, including carrying costs, associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to customers through the operation of the PGA clauses or GSA rider. Accordingly, the Utilities do not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments. However, the timing of recovery for cash payments related to margin requirements may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. For more information about the Utilities natural gas derivative instruments, see Note 10 , Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 Gas Marketing 
 
 In the course of its business, Spire s non-regulated gas marketing subsidiary, Spire Marketing, enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and natural gas index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments. In accordance with the risk management policy, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed price commitments. This risk is currently managed either by closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed-prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to lock in margins. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, Spire Marketing s unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spire s financial position or results of operations. 

41

Table of Contents 

As mentioned above, Spire Marketing uses natural gas futures, options and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the NYMEX and ICE to manage the commodity price risk associated with its fixed-price natural gas purchase and sale commitments. These derivative instruments may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases or sales. Such accounting treatment, if elected, generally permits a substantial portion of the gain or loss to be deferred from recognition in earnings until the period that the associated forecasted purchase or sale is recognized in earnings. To the extent a hedge is effective, gains or losses on the derivatives will be offset by changes in the value of the hedged forecasted transactions. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, Spire Marketing had no designated cash flow hedges. Information about the fair values of Spire Marketing s exchange-traded/cleared natural gas derivative instruments is presented below:

Certain of Spire Marketing s physical natural gas derivative contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales, as permitted by GAAP. This election permits the Company to account for the contract in the period the natural gas is delivered. Contracts not designated as normal purchases or normal sales, including those designated as trading activities, are accounted for as derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the periods prior to settlement. 
 
 Below is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for physical natural gas contracts accounted for as derivatives, none of which will settle beyond fiscal 2025:

Counterparty Credit Risk 
 
 Spire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with energy producers, utility companies and pipelines. These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Company s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. To the extent possible, Spire Marketing enters into netting arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate exposure to credit risk. It is also exposed to credit risk associated with its derivative contracts designated as normal purchases and normal sales. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations. For more information on these and other concentrations of credit risk, including how Spire Marketing manages these risks, see Note 11 , Concentrations of Credit Risk, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Company is subject to interest rate risk associated with its short-term debt issuances. Based on average short-term borrowings during fiscal 2024, an increase of 100 basis points in the underlying average interest rate for short-term debt would have caused an increase in interest expense (and a decrease in pre-tax earnings and cash flows) of approximately 9.2 on an annual basis. Portions of such an increase may be offset through the Utilities application of PGA and GSA carrying costs. At September 30, 2024, Spire had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling 3,771.1, of which 1,818.0 was issued by Spire Missouri, 750.0 was issued by Spire Alabama, and 1,203.1 was issued by Spire and other subsidiaries. While the long-term debt issues are fixed-rate, they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemptions of long-term debt would typically be deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and amortized over a future period.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Spire Inc. 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Spire Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2024, of the Company and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Spire Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Regulatory Matters Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Note 15 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company accounts for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, Regulated Operations . The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities).

Table of Contents 

The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Missouri and Alabama Public Service Commissions (the Commissions ), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of natural gas companies within their respective geographies. The Company has stated that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. 
 
 Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items, including property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; and depreciation expense, and affects multiple disclosures in the Company s financial statements. There is a risk that the Commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. As a result, we identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of current and future regulatory orders on events that have occurred as of September 30, 2024, and the judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures. Management judgments included assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs or (2) refunds to customers or future reduction in rates. Given that management s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these rate-impacted account balances and disclosures, and the related judgments, requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation due to the inherent complexities associated with the specialized rules related to accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over evaluating the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 
 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments, in the financial statements. 
 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company in Missouri and Alabama; regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, and filings made by interveners; and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. 
 
 We obtained from management the regulatory orders that support the probability of recovery, refund, and/or future reduction in rates for regulatory assets and liabilities and assessed management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Dollars in millions, except per share, per unit and per gallon amounts) 

reportable segments: Gas Utility, Gas Marketing, and Midstream. The Gas Utility segment consists of the regulated natural gas distribution operations of the Company and is the core business segment of Spire in terms of revenue and earnings. The Gas Utility segment is comprised of the operations of: Spire Missouri, serving St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas in Missouri; Spire Alabama, serving central and northern Alabama; and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth, serving the Mobile, Alabama area and south-central Mississippi. The Gas Marketing segment includes Spire s largest gas-related business, Spire Marketing Inc. Spire Marketing ), which provides non-regulated natural gas services throughout the United States (U.S.). The Midstream segment includes Spire Storage, Spire STL Pipeline and Spire MoGas Pipeline, which are subsidiaries engaged in the storage and transportation of natural gas. The activities of the Company s other subsidiaries are reported as Other and are described in Note 14 , Information by Operating Segment. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama each have a single reportable segment. 

of the original cost of depreciable and amortizable property. 
 
 Non-utility Property Non-utility property is recorded at the original cost of acquisition or construction, which includes material, labor, contractor services and, for FERC-regulated projects, an allowance for funds used during construction. Repairs, replacements and renewals of items of property determined to be less than a unit of property or that do not increase the property s life or functionality are charged to maintenance expense. Upon retirement or sale of non-utility property, the original cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the income statements. Costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related software. If software is retired prior to being fully amortized, the difference is recorded as a loss in the income statements.

and , respectively. The carrying value of the Utilities inventory is never adjusted to a lower net realizable value or market value because, pursuant to Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses or a Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider, actual gas costs are recovered in customer rates. Natural gas and propane gas storage inventory in Spire s other operating segments is recorded at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. 
 
 , zero, and zero, respectively, with the remainder held at the corporate level. Goodwill amounts have not changed since fiscal 2017, and there are no accumulated impairment losses. Spire and Spire Missouri evaluate goodwill for impairment as of July 1 of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. At each test date, the assessments concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The Company updated the assessments as of September 30, 2024 , determining that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 
 
 On January 19, 2024, a subsidiary in Spire s Midstream segment acquired MoGas Pipeline, an interstate natural gas pipeline, and Omega Pipeline, a connected gas distribution system in Missouri. MoGas interconnects with Spire STL Pipeline and other regional pipelines to deliver gas to Spire Missouri s growing customer base in St. Charles, Franklin, and western St. Louis counties, among other utility, municipal, industrial and commercial customers. Omega owns and operates an approximately 75 -mile natural gas distribution system within Fort Leonard Wood in south-central Missouri and is interconnected with the MoGas system. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations . The purchase price was allocated almost entirely to property, plant and equipment based on their estimated fair value at the acquisition date and recorded as non-utility property in the consolidated balance sheet. The operating revenues and operating income of MoGas and Omega were not material to Spire s consolidated results for the year ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 A subsidiary of Spire in the Midstream segment acquired a natural gas storage facility in northern Oklahoma, now named Spire Storage Salt Plains LLC, on April 1, 2023. The purchase price was fully allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value at the acquisition date, consisting almost entirely of base gas and other property, plant and equipment. The operating revenues and operating income of the acquired business were not material to Spire s consolidated results for the years ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

FINANCE RECEIVABLES Spire Alabama finances third party contractor sales of merchandise including gas furnaces and appliances. At September 30, 2024 and 2023 , Spire Alabama s finance receivable totaled approximately and , respectively. Financing is available only to qualified customers who meet creditworthiness thresholds for customer payment history and external agency credit reports. Spire Alabama relies upon ongoing payments as the primary indicator of credit quality during the term of each contract. The allowance for credit losses is recognized using an estimate of write-off percentages based on historical experience. Delinquent accounts are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and, absent evidence of debt repayment, after 90 days are due in full and assigned to a third -party collection agency. The remaining finance receivable is written off approximately 12 months after being assigned to the third -party collection agency. Spire Alabama had finance receivables past due 90 days or more of and at September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively.

 Total Operating Revenues 

The Utilities sell natural gas to residential and other customers. The sale of natural gas is governed by the various state utility commissions, which set rates, charges, and terms and conditions of service, collectively included in a tariff. The performance obligation, which relates to the promise to provide natural gas, is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the natural gas, and revenue is recognized accordingly. 
 
 The Utilities transportation revenue relates to the promise to transport the specified quantities of natural gas at tariff rates. This performance obligation is satisfied over time as the gas is transported, and revenue is recognized as invoiced monthly. 

The Utilities have alternative revenue programs (ARPs), which represent an agreement between the utility and its regulator, currently consisting of decoupling mechanisms (also known as weather normalization adjustments) and incentive programs (primarily Alabama s Cost Control Measure). When the criteria to recognize additional (or reduced) revenue from ARPs have been met, the Utilities establish a regulatory asset (or liability). When amounts previously recognized for ARPs are billed, the Utilities reduce the regulatory asset (or liability) and increase (or decrease) accounts receivable. Billed amounts, which are part of the overall tariff paid by customers, are included in revenue from contracts with customers, while the change in the related regulatory asset or liability is presented as revenue from ARPs. Depending on whether the beginning accrued ARP balance was a regulatory asset or liability and depending on the size and direction of the current period accrual, the amount presented as revenue from ARPs could be negative. 
 
 The Utilities read meters and bill customers on monthly cycles. Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi record their gas utility revenues from gas sales and transportation services on an accrual basis that includes estimated amounts for gas delivered but not yet billed. The accruals for unbilled revenues are reversed in the subsequent accounting period when meters are actually read and customers are billed. Spire Alabama records natural gas distribution revenues in accordance with the tariff established by the APSC. Unbilled revenue is accrued in an amount equal to the related gas cost, as profit margin is not considered earned until billed. Spire s other subsidiaries, including Spire Marketing, record revenues when earned, as the product is delivered or as services are performed. 
 
 Gas Marketing s contracts are derivatives. Wholesale contracts (with producers, municipalities, and utility companies) are subject to derivative accounting. Retail contracts (with large commercial and industrial customers) are designated as normal purchase, normal sale arrangements and are therefore accounted for as revenue from contracts with customers. The performance obligation is satisfied over time by the transfer of control of natural gas to the customer, and revenue is recognized as invoiced monthly. 
 
 Payments are generally required within 30 days of billing, and contracts generally do not have a significant financing component. Spire s revenues are not subject to significant returns, refunds, or warranty obligations. 
 
 Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama have elected to apply a right to invoice practical expedient, recognizing revenue for volumes delivered for which they have a right to invoice, as long as that amount corresponds with the value to the customer. Disclosures about remaining performance obligations are not required because either contracts have an original expected duration of one year or less, or revenue is recognized under the right to invoice practical expedient, or both. 
 
 Sales taxes imposed on applicable Spire Alabama and Spire Missouri sales are billed to customers. These amounts are not recorded in the statements of income but are recorded as tax collections payable and included in the Other line of the Current Liabilities section of the balance sheets. 
 
 Gross receipts taxes associated with the Company s natural gas utility services are imposed on the Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama and billed to its customers. The expense amounts (shown in the table below) are reported gross in the Taxes, other than income taxes line in the statements of income, and corresponding revenues are reported in Operating Revenues.

 The Company allows participants in the EIP the ability to defer a portion or all of their award. As of September 30, 2024, a total o f share equivalents (at target payout) have been deferred by participants. Such units are included in the data presented below. After the required holding period, deferred awards are ultimately paid in cash rather than in shares of stock. Upon vesting, the Company issues new shares to satisfy awards that are not deferred. 
 
 Restricted Stock Awards 
 
 During fiscal 2024 , the Company grant ed performance-contingent restricted share units to executive officers and key employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of per share. This number represents the target shares that can be earned pursuant to the terms of the awards. The share units have a performance period ending September 30, 2026. While the participants have no interim voting rights on these share units, dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid to the participants upon vesting but are subject to forfeiture if the underlying share units do not vest. 
 
 The number of share units that will ultimately vest is dependent upon the attainment of certain levels of earnings, as well as the Company s level of total shareholder return (TSR) during the performance period relative to a comparator group of peer companies. This TSR provision is considered a market condition under GAAP and is discussed further below. The maximum amount of shares or share equivalents that can be earned pursuant to the terms of the awards is of the target units granted. 
 
 The weighted average grant date fair value of performance-contingent restricted share units granted during fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was and per share, respectively. 
 
 Fiscal 2024 activity of restricted stock units subject to performance and/or market conditions is presented below: 

Granted 
 Adjusted for performance 
 Vested 
 Forfeited 
 Non-vested at September 30, 2024 

For the year ended September 30, 2024 , the total number of shares or share equivalents that could be issued if all outstanding award grants attain maximum performance payout is . 

During fiscal 2024 , the Company granted shares of time-vested restricted stock to executive officers and key employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of per share. Unless forfeited based on terms of the agreements, these shares will vest in fiscal 2027. In the interim, participants receive full voting rights and dividends, which are not subject to forfeiture. The weighted average grant date fair value of time-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded to employees during fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was and per share, respectively. 
 
 During fiscal 2024 , the Company granted shares of time-vested restricted stock to non-employee directors at a weighted average grant date fair value of per share. These shares vested in fiscal 2024 , six months after the grant date. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock awarded to non-employee directors during fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was and per share, respectively. 
 
 Time-vested restricted stock and stock unit activity for fiscal 2024 is presented below: 

Granted 
 Vested 
 Forfeited 
 Non-vested at September 30, 2024 

For restricted stock and stock units (performance-contingent and time-vested) that vested during fiscal years 2024 , 2023 , and 2022 , the Company withheld shares, shares, and shares, respectively, at weighted average prices of , and per share, respectively, pursuant to elections by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The total fair value of restricted stock (performance-contingent and time-vested) that vested during fiscal years 2024 , 2023 , and 2022 was 11.9, , and , respectively, and the related tax benefit was , , and , respectively. None of the tax benefits have been realized. 

Equity Compensation Costs 
 
 Compensation cost for performance-contingent restricted stock and stock unit awards is based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions. For shares or units that do not vest or that are not expected to vest due to the outcome of the performance conditions (excluding market conditions), no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. 
 
 The fair value of awards of performance-contingent and time-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units, not subject to the TSR provision, are estimated using the closing price of the Company s stock on the grant date. For those awards that do not pay dividends during the vesting period, the estimate of fair value is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the Company s common stock during the performance period, discounted using an appropriate U.S. Treasury yield. For shares subject to the TSR provision, the estimated impact of this market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value per share of the awards. Accordingly, compensation cost is not reversed to reflect any actual reductions in the awards that may result from the TSR provision. However, if the Company s TSR during the performance period ranks below the level specified in the award agreements, relative to a comparator group of companies, and the Committee elects not to reduce the award (or reduce by a lesser amount), this election would be accounted for as a modification of the original award and additional compensation cost would be recognized at that time. The grant date fair value of the awards subject to the TSR provision awarded during fiscal years 2024 , 2023 and 2022 was valued by a Monte Carlo simulation model that assessed the probabilities of various TSR outcomes. The significant assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulations are as follows: 

Expected dividend yield of stock 
 Expected volatility of stock 
 Performance period (in years) 

The risk-free interest rate was based on the yield on U.S. Treasury securities matching the vesting period. A -percent dividend yield was used, which is mathematically equivalent to the assumption that dividends are reinvested as they are paid. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock. Volatility assumptions were also made for each of the companies included in the comparator group. The vesting period is equal to the performance period set forth in the terms of the award. 
 
 The amounts of compensation cost recognized for share-based compensation arrangements are presented below: 

Compensation cost capitalized 
 Compensation cost recognized in net income 
 Income tax benefit recognized in net income 
 Compensation cost recognized in net income, net of income tax 

As of September 30, 2024 , there was o f total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years.

Of these contracts, million MMBtu will settle during fiscal 2025 , and million MMBtu, million MMBtu, and million MMBtu, will settle during fiscal years 2026, 2027, and 2028, respectively. A total of million MMBtu will settle in the years 2029 - 2031. These contracts have not been designated as hedges; therefore, changes in the fair value of these contracts are reported in earnings each period. 

Furthermore, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed-priced commitments by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of NYMEX or ICE futures, swap, and option contracts to lock in margins. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , Spire Marketing s unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spire s financial position or results of operations. Spire Marketing s NYMEX and ICE natural gas futures, swap and option contracts used to lock in margins may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions for financial reporting purposes. 
 
 Spire enters into cash flow hedges through the execution of interest rate swap contracts to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates. At September 30, 2024, the following swaps were outstanding:

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions are recognized on the balance sheets of the Company at fair value, and the change in fair value of the effective portion of these hedge instruments is recorded, net of income tax, in other comprehensive income or loss (OCI). Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI) is a component of Total Common Stock Equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI into earnings when the hedged items affect net income, using the same revenue or expense category that the hedged item impacts. Based on market prices at September 30, 2024 , it is expected that of net gains will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Income of the Company during the next twelve months.

Spire Missouri 
 
 Spire Missouri has a risk management policy to utilize various derivatives, including futures contracts, exchange-traded options, swaps and over-the-counter instruments for the explicit purpose of managing price risk associated with purchasing and delivering natural gas on a regular basis to customers in accordance with its tariffs. The objective of this policy is to limit Spire Missouri s exposure to natural gas price volatility and to manage, hedge and mitigate substantial price risk. This policy strictly prohibits speculation and permits Spire Missouri to hedge current physical natural gas purchase commitments or forecasted or anticipated future peak (maximum) physical need for natural gas delivered. Costs and cost reductions, including carrying costs, associated with Spire Missouri s use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to Spire Missouri customers through the operation of its PGA clause, through which the MoPSC allows Spire Missouri to recover gas supply costs, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC. Accordingly, Spire Missouri does not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments. 
 
 Spire Missouri does not designate these instruments as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes because gains or losses associated with the use of these derivative instruments are deferred and recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations , and, as a result, have no direct impact on the statements of income. 
 
 The timing of the operation of the PGA clause may cause interim variations in short-term cash flows, because Spire Missouri is subject to cash margin requirements associated with changes in the values of these instruments. Nevertheless, carrying costs associated with such requirements are recovered through the PGA clause. 

From time to time, Spire Missouri purchases NYMEX futures and options contracts to help stabilize operating costs associated with forecasted purchases of gasoline and diesel fuels used to power vehicles and equipment used in the course of its business. The gains and losses on these contracts are not subject to Spire Missouri s PGA clause. At September 30, 2024 , Spire Missouri did not have a material amount of gasoline futures contracts outstanding. 
 
 Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions are recognized on the balance sheets at fair value and the change in the fair value of the effective portion of these hedge instruments is recorded, net of income tax, in OCI. AOCI is a component of Total Common Stock Equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI into earnings when the hedged items affect net income, using the same revenue or expense category that the hedged item impacts. As in both 2023 and 2022 , there will be no reclassifications into the statements of income during fiscal 2025 . Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the items that are being hedged in the statements of cash flows. 
 
 Spire Missouri s derivative instruments consist primarily of NYMEX positions. The NYMEX is the primary national commodities exchange on which natural gas derivatives are traded. Open NYMEX natural gas futures positions at September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 

At September 30, 2024 , Spire Missouri had also had million MMBtu of other price mitigation in place through the use of NYMEX natural gas option-based strategies.

Spire Alabama 
 
 Spire Alabama periodically employs a gasoline derivative program to help stabilize operating costs associated with forecasted purchases of gasoline and diesel fuels used to power vehicles and equipment used in the course of its business. The gains or losses on these derivative instruments are not subject to Spire Alabama s GSA rider. There were no such contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 

million customers in three states across multiple rate classes resulting in a significant amount of revenue diversity. Credit risk is mitigated by the high percentage of residential customers as well as the geographic diversity of the Utilities, though customers for each of the Utilities are concentrated in a single state. 
 
 Spire Marketing s accounts receivable attributable to utility companies and their marketing affiliates totaled at September 30, 2024 . The concentration of transactions with these counterparties has the potential to affect the Company s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers in this group may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. At September 30, 2024 , the amounts included in accounts receivable from its five largest counterparties (in terms of net accounts receivable exposure) totaled . Three of these five counterparties are investment-grade-rated integrated utilities, one is a liquefied natural gas project facility with a senior debt issue rating one notch below investment-grade with a positive outlook, and one is a utility marketing affiliate which is not rated but whose owners are all investment-grade public power companies. 
 
 To manage these risks, Spire Marketing has established procedures to determine the creditworthiness of its counterparties. These procedures include obtaining credit ratings and credit reports, analyzing counterparty financial statements to assess financial condition, and considering the industry environment in which the counterparty operates. This information is monitored on an ongoing basis. In some instances, Spire Marketing may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit, or parental guaranties. In addition, Spire Marketing may enter into netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties in the energy industry with whom it conducts both sales and purchases of natural gas. Where there is no netting arrangement, Spire Marketing records accounts receivable, accounts payable, and prepayments for physical sales and purchases of natural gas on a gross basis. Sales are typically made on an unsecured credit basis with payment due the month following delivery. Accounts receivable amounts are closely monitored and provisions for uncollectible amounts are accrued when losses are probable.

As indicated in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company s regulated operations accounting for income taxes is impacted by ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations . The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) reduced the corporate federal income tax rate, and the corresponding reductions in deferred income tax balances resulted in amounts previously collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes becoming refundable to such customers, generally through reductions in future rates. The TCJA includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes are to be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. In fiscal year 2018, the MoPSC Amended Report and Order took effect and the estimated excess accumulated deferred income tax began to be returned to Spire Missouri customers in rates. During fiscal year 2022, the amount of excess accumulated deferred income taxes was trued up as part of the rate proceeding. The amount being returned related to the TCJA has been updated and in addition the excess accumulated deferred income taxes related to the Missouri tax rate change began to be returned in fiscal year 2022. For Spire Missouri, excess accumulated deferred taxes of , , and , respectively, were returned in fiscal year 2024, 2023, and 2022. The treatment for accumulated deferred income tax balances for Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi started to be accounted for during fiscal year 2023. For Spire Gulf, and , respectively, were returned to ratepayers in fiscal year 2024 and 2023. Spire Mississippi returned less than and , respectively, in fiscal year 2024 and 2023. For Spire Alabama, the deferred tax position resulted in a collection from customers of and , respectively, for fiscal years 2024 and 2023. 
 
 On April 14, 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023 - 15 that provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether to deduct or capitalize expenditures to repair, maintain, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property. Under the revenue procedure, the method of accounting will depend on the property s classification as linear transmission property, linear distribution property, or non-linear property. The revenue procedure may be adopted in tax years ending after May 1, 2023. It is anticipated the Company will adopt the revenue procedure with the filing of its tax return for the year ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years, the timing of deferred tax liability reversals, projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback years, and tax planning strategies to assess the need for a valuation allowance. Based upon this evidence, management believes it is more likely than not the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets. 

As of September 30, 2024 , Spire, and on a separate company basis, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, had carryforwards as shown below. 

Tax credit carryforwards 

For federal tax purposes, Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s loss carryforwards may be utilized against income from another member of the consolidated group. The loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2030 for certain state purposes and fiscal 2037 for federal and other state purposes. The tax credit carryforwards are expected to be utilized prior to their expiration. 
 
 The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama recognize the tax benefit from a tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Unrecognized tax benefits are reported as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for an operating loss carryforward to the extent the recognition of the benefit would impact the operating loss carryforward, pursuant to ASU 2013 - 11. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits. 

Increases related to tax positions taken in current year 
 Reductions due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations 
 Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year 

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate were and , respectively, for the Company, and , respectively, for Spire Missouri, and and , respectively, for Spire Alabama. It is reasonably possible that events will occur in the next 12 months that could increase or decrease the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits. The Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama do not expect that any such change will be significant to the balance sheets. Spire Alabama reported no unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal year 2022. 

The Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama record potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense and other income deductions, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , interest accrued associated with uncertain tax positions was de minimis, and no penalties were accrued. 
 
 The Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama are no longer subject to examination for fiscal years prior to 2021, except to the extent the net operating losses from prior years are reviewed. 

The net periodic pension cost includes components shown in the following table. The components other than the service costs and regulatory adjustment are presented in Other Income, Net in the income statement, except for Spire Alabama s losses on lump-sum settlements. Such losses are capitalized in regulatory balances and amortized over the remaining actuarial life of individuals in the plan, and that amortization is presented in Other Income, Net.

Spire pension obligations are driven by separate plan and regulatory provisions governing Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire EnergySouth pension plans. 
 
 Pursuant to the provisions of Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s pension plans, pension obligations may be satisfied by monthly annuities, lump-sum cash payments, or special termination benefits. Lump-sum payments are recognized as settlements (which can result in gains or losses) only if the total of such payments exceeds the sum of service and interest costs in a specific year. Special termination benefits, when offered, are also recognized as settlements which can result in gains or losses. 
 
 In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 two Spire Missouri plans met the criteria for settlement recognition for lump sum payments, with one of the plans also offering special termination benefits, requiring re-measurement of the obligation under those plans using updated census data and assumptions for discount rate and mortality. For the remeasurements, the discount rate for the Missouri plans were updated to at September 30, 2024 from at September 30, 2023). Total Spire Missouri lump sum payments recognized as settlements during fiscal 2024 were . 
 
 In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, one Spire Missouri plan and two Spire Alabama plans met the criteria for settlement recognition, requiring re-measurement of the obligation under those plans using updated census data and assumptions for discount rate and mortality. For the remeasurements, the discount rate for the Missouri plan was updated to at September 30, 2023 from at September 30, 2022), and the discount rate for the Alabama plans were updated to and , respectively, (from and , respectively). Lump-sum payments recognized as settlements during fiscal 2023 was attributable to Spire Missouri and to Spire Alabama). The Alabama regulatory tariff requires that settlement losses be amortized over the remaining actuarial life of the individuals in the plan, and in fiscal 2023 the amortization periods range from years to years. Therefore, no lump sum settlement expenses were recorded in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. 

Effective December 23, 2021, the pension cost for Spire Missouri s western territory (Missouri West) included in customer rates was reduced from to per year, the pension cost included in Spire Missouri s eastern territory (Missouri East) customer rates was increased from to per year. Subsequently, on December 26, 2022, the amount in Missouri East was lowered to . The difference between these amounts and pension expense as calculated pursuant to the above and that otherwise would be included in the statements of income and statements of comprehensive income is deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. 
 
 Also effective December 23, 2021, Missouri East prepaid pension assets and other postretirement benefits that were previously being included in rates at per year for eight years were reduced to per year, with the amortization period being reset for another eight years. Missouri West net liability for pension and other postretirement benefits that were previously reducing rates by per year for eight years were reduced to a reduction in rates per year, with the amortization period being reset for another eight years. Subsequently, on December 26, 2022, Missouri East amortization was lowered to and Missouri West to a reduction of .

In 2024, almost all of the qualified plans experienced increases to their respective benefit obligations. The discount rates decreased between and basis points compared to the prior fiscal year-end which led to liability losses. Lump sum rates for two plans decreased from the prior fiscal year, leading to further liability losses. Finally, experience study assumption changes, including updated termination rates, retirement rates, salary scale, form of payment, spouse age and percentage married resulted in liability gains for Spire Alabama and liability losses for Spire Missouri.

The Spire Inc. Retirement Plans Committee is responsible for the administration of the various plans, and all payments under the plans require direction of that committee. The Spire Inc. Defined Benefit Plan Investment Review Committee utilizes an Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) model where investment decisions are outsourced to investment consultants (Willis Towers Watson), who in turn become co-fiduciaries with the committee. 
 
 For all plans, the Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets with a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, corporate financial condition and market conditions. The Company has developed an investment strategy that focuses on asset allocation, diversification and quality guidelines. The investment goals are to obtain an adequate level of return to meet future obligations of the plan by providing above average risk-adjusted returns with a risk exposure in the mid-range of comparable funds. Comparative market and peer group benchmarks are utilized to ensure that investment managers are performing satisfactorily. The Company seeks to maintain an appropriate level of diversification to minimize the risk of large losses in a single asset class. Accordingly, plan assets for the pension plans do not have a concentration of assets in a single entity, industry, country, commodity or class of investment fund. 
 
 The following table sets forth expected pension benefit payments for the succeeding five fiscal years, and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama:

The funding policy of Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama is to contribute an amount not less than the minimum required by government funding standards nor more than the maximum deductible amount for federal income tax purposes. Spire Missouri s contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2025 are anticipated to be into the qualified trusts, and into the non-qualified plans. Spire Alabama s contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2025 are anticipated to be into the qualified trusts. 

Other Postretirement Benefits 
 
 Spire and the Utilities provide certain life insurance benefits at retirement. Spire Missouri plans provide for medical insurance after early retirement until age 65. For retirements prior to January 1, 2015, the Missouri West plans provided medical insurance after retirement until death. The Spire Alabama plans provide medical insurance upon retirement until death for certain retirees depending on the type of employee and the date the employee was originally hired. 
 
 Net periodic postretirement benefit costs consist of the following components: 

Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
 Expected return on plan assets 
 Amortization of prior service cost (credit) 
 Amortization of actuarial gain 
 Special termination benefits 
 Subtotal 
 Regulatory adjustment 
 Net postretirement benefit (income) cost

 Amortization of actuarial gain 
 Current year prior service cost 
 Amortization of prior service (cost) credit 
 Subtotal 
 Regulatory adjustment 
 Total recognized in OCI 

Pursuant to a MoPSC Order, the return on plan assets is based on the market-related value of plan assets implemented prospectively over a four -year period. Gains and losses not yet includible in postretirement benefit cost are amortized only to the extent that such gain or loss exceeds of the greater of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. Such excess is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. Effective December 23, 2021, the allowance for recovery in rates for Spire Missouri s postretirement benefit plans was discontinued. The difference between no recovery in rates and postretirement expense as calculated pursuant to the above and that otherwise would be included in the statements of income and statements of comprehensive income is deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. Effective with the resolution of the 2022 Missouri rate case in December 2022, net liabilities for postretirement benefits reduced rates and per year for Missouri East and Missouri West, respectively. 
 
 In fiscal 2024, Spire Missouri offered an early retirement incentive to select employees, which resulted in a increase in the postretirement obligation. 

The following table sets forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the postretirement benefit obligation at September 30:

In fiscal 2024 , the discount rates decreased basis points compared to the prior fiscal year-end which led to liability losses for both Spire Alabama and Spire Missouri plans. Experience study assumption changes including updated termination rates, retirement rates, employee and spouse participation, and spouse age resulted in gains for both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama. For Spire Alabama, these gains did not offset the impact of the discount rate decrease, resulting in a net increase in obligation benefit. For Spire Missouri plans, these gains, combined with higher benefit payments, more than offset the impact of the discount rate decrease and the recognition of special termination benefits, resulting in a net decrease in the benefit obligation.

Missouri and Alabama state laws provide for the recovery in rates of costs accrued pursuant to GAAP provided that such costs are funded through an independent, external funding mechanism. The Utilities have established Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association and Rabbi Trusts as external funding mechanisms. Their investment policies seek to maximize investment returns consistent with their tolerance for risk. Outside investment management specialists are utilized in each asset class. Such specialists are provided with guidelines, where appropriate, designed to ensure that the investment portfolio is managed in accordance with policy. Performance and compliance with the guidelines is regularly monitored. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama currently invest in mutual funds which are rebalanced periodically to the target allocation. The mutual funds are diversified across U.S. stock and bond markets, and for Spire Alabama, international stock markets. 
 
 The following table sets forth expected postretirement benefit payments for the succeeding five fiscal years, and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama:

Like all the Company s regulatory assets, these regulatory assets as of September 30, 2024 are expected to be recovered from customers in future rates. The recovery period for the future income taxes due from customers and pension and other postretirement benefit costs could be years or longer, based on current Internal Revenue Service guidelines and average remaining service life of active participants, respectively. The recovery period for the PGA assets is about one year. The other items not earning a return are expected to be recovered over a period not to exceed years, consistent with precedent set by the MoPSC, except for certain debt costs expected to be recovered over the related debt term (currently to 2051 ). Spire Alabama does not have any regulatory assets that are not earning a return. 

Spire Missouri 
 
 As authorized by the MoPSC, the PGA clause allows Spire Missouri to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies. To better match customer billings with market natural gas prices, Spire Missouri is allowed to file to modify, on a periodic basis, the level of gas costs in its PGA. Some provisions of the PGA clause are: 
 Spire Missouri has a risk management policy that allows for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. The MoPSC clarified that costs, cost reductions, and carrying costs associated with the Utility s use of natural gas derivative instruments are gas costs recoverable through the PGA mechanism. 
 The tariffs allow Spire Missouri flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months. 
 Spire Missouri is authorized to apply carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including cost increases and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, including cash payments for margin deposits. 
 Pre-tax income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues is shared with customers such that customers receive and Spire Missouri receives (after the first of annual value from capacity release goes entirely to customers through fiscal 2029 ). 

Pursuant to the provisions of the PGA clause, the difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clause, as well as the actual amount of off-system sales and capacity release revenues allocated to customers, are reflected as a regulatory asset or liability at the end of the fiscal year. At that time, the balance is classified as a current asset or current liability and recovered from, or credited to, customers over an annual period commencing in the subsequent November. The balance in the current account is amortized as amounts are reflected in customer billings. In fiscal 2023, Spire Missouri filed two changes to its tariff, which were approved and became effective in November 2022 and January 2023. In fiscal 2024, the MoPSC approved slight decreases in the PGA in Spire Missouri s western service territory tariff effective in November 2023 and June 2024 and no change in the eastern service territory). On November 12, 2024, based on a recent Spire Missouri filing, the MoPSC approved a PGA decrease of approximately for both service territories effective November 15, 2024. 
 
 In mid- February 2021, the central U.S. experienced a period of unusually severe cold weather Winter Storm Uri ), and Spire Missouri implemented an Operational Flow Order (OFO) to preserve the integrity of its distribution system. During this time, Spire Missouri was required to purchase additional natural gas supply, both to ensure adequate supply for its firm utility customers, and to cover the shortfall created when third -party marketers failed to deliver natural gas supply to its city gates on behalf of their customers. In accordance with its MoPSC-approved OFO tariff, Spire Missouri invoiced the cost of gas and associated penalties totaling to non-compliant marketers and recorded accounts receivable. Recoveries collected are an offset to cost of natural gas for firm utility customers through the PGA and Actual Cost Adjustment (ACA) so are net income neutral to Spire Missouri. The three largest counterparties did not remit payment when due, so Spire Missouri filed suit against them in federal court to recover the invoiced amounts. In late February 2022, the parties to the OFO waiver suits agreed to a settlement in principle, pursuant to which marketers will reimburse Spire Missouri for the actual cost of its incremental gas purchases to serve marketers customers during Winter Storm Uri, so Spire Missouri reduced revenue, accounts receivable, cost of gas and regulatory liabilities by approximately in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The settlement, which reduced the total amount due from the three marketers to approximately , was approved by the MoPSC in late May 2022. The marketers are making timely payments to Spire Missouri, and the remaining total balance was less than as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In 2022, the MoPSC initiated its annual ACA dockets (GR- 2022 - 0135 and GR- 2022 - 0136 to audit gas commodity and transportation costs for the 2020 - 2021 heating season, which included the impact of Winter Storm Uri in mid- February 2021 on Spire Missouri s natural gas portfolio. In December 2022, the MoPSC Staff proposed disallowances relating to imbalance cash-outs and an off-system sale. In fiscal 2024, all outstanding issues were resolved with no impact on historically reported results. 
 
 The Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS) allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to replace qualifying components of its infrastructure without the necessity of a formal rate case. All prior ISRS revenues were reset to zero as of December 26, 2022 as a result of Spire Missouri s most recent base rate case. Since then, the MoPSC has approved cumulative annual ISRS revenue increases of (with the latest increase of effective on November 16, 2024), reflecting eligible pipe replacement from September 2022 through August 2024. 

Spire Alabama 
 
 In September 2022, the APSC approved the renewal of Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE) through September 30, 2025, with certain modifications to the previous terms. Under RSE, the APSC conducts reviews in March, June and September to determine whether Spire Alabama s return on average common equity (RCE) at the end of the rate year will be within the allowed range of return. Reductions in rates can be made quarterly to bring the projected RCE within the allowed range; increases, however, are allowed only once each rate year, effective December 1, and cannot exceed of prior-year revenues. Effective October 1, 2022, Spire Alabama's allowed range of RCE is to with an adjusting point of . Previously, the allowed range was to with an adjusting point of . Spire Alabama is subject to a performance-based adjustment of plus or minus basis points to the RCE adjusting point, based upon the terms of the previously approved Accelerated Infrastructure Modernization (AIM) Program tariff; however, Spire applied for and received approval to suspend the operation of the AIM performance-based adjustment for 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, impacting fiscal years 2023 through 2026. Spire Alabama s equity as a percent of total capitalization is limited to , and Average Common Equity growth is limited to each year. 
 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Spire Alabama made its annual RSE rate filing with the APSC, presenting the utility s budget for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and new rates designed to provide an annual revenue increase of became effective January 1, 2023. On October 26, 2023, Spire Alabama made its annual RSE rate filing, presenting the utility s budget for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. After an amended filing on December 27, 2023, new rates designed to provide an annual revenue increase of became effective January 1, 2024. At the September 30, 2024 point of test, the RCE was above the allowed range, resulting in a reduction in rates totaling annually effective in December 2024. On October 24, 2024, Spire Alabama made its annual RSE rate filing (based on its budget for fiscal 2025 including proposed rates designed to provide an annual revenue increase of , subject to review by the APSC staff and the Office of the Attorney General. 
 
 The inflation-based Cost Control Measure (CCM) established by the APSC allows for annual changes in operation and maintenance O M expense relative to an index range. Effective October 1, 2022, the Base Year O M expense was computed by averaging the actual O M expenses for 2020, 2021, and 2022. The Base CPI-U was computed by averaging the August CPI-U for 2020, 2021, 2022. The Index is computed by measuring the change from the Base CPI-U to the August CPI-U of the most recently completed fiscal year, less a factor of . The index range will be computed by adjusting the Index plus or minus . If rate year O M expense falls within the index range, no adjustment is required. If rate year O M expense exceeds the index range, three -quarters of the difference is returned to customers through future rate adjustments. To the extent rate year O M is less than the index range, Spire Alabama benefits by one -half of the difference through future rate adjustments. If a benefit is achieved, the Base Year and the Base CPI-U for the following year will each be reset to an average of the three preceding completed years. If a benefit is not achieved, the Base Year and Base CPI-U will not be updated. Certain items that fluctuate based on situations demonstrated to be beyond Spire Alabama s control may be excluded from the CCM calculation. Spire Alabama recorded a CCM benefit for rate year 2022 of . To mitigate the impact on ratepayers, Spire requested and received approval to recover the rate year 2022 CCM benefit over five years (with recognition of revenue only up to 24 months in advance of recovery). Spire Alabama recorded CCM benefits for rate years 2023 and 2024 of and , respectively. 
 
 Spire Alabama s rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabama s tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA rider, which is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabama s earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather-related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. There is also a mechanism under Spire Alabama's GSA rider allowing the utility to create value through off-system sales of excess natural gas supply and capacity and to give of the value created to customers while retaining (after the first of value from capacity release goes entirely to customers). In fiscal 2023, GSA rate increases were effective December 1, 2022 and January 1, 2023, and in fiscal 2024, GSA rate decreases were effective October 1, 2023, January 1, 2024, and April 1, 2024, primarily attributable to changes in natural gas commodity prices. 

Spire 
 
 In addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is affected by the following regulatory matters. 
 
 Spire Gulf has similar rate regulation to Spire Alabama. Its RSE rate-setting mechanism was renewed in September 2021 for a four -year term through September 2025. The RSE allowed RCE range is to with an adjusting point of for fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2025. In October 2021 and 2022, Spire Gulf made its annual RSE rate filings with the APSC based on its budget for the new fiscal year, and new rates designed to provide increased annual revenues of and became effective at the beginning of January 2022 and 2023, respectively. Spire Gulf filed its RSE point of test as of April 30, 2023 with the APSC reflecting that its projected RCE exceeded the allowed RCE resulting in an annualized refund of that became effective July 1, 2023. Spire Gulf s September 30, 2023 RSE point of test reflected that its actual RCE still exceeded the allowed RCE, resulting in an additional annualized refund of that became effective December 13, 2023. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Spire Gulf made its annual RSE filing (based on its budget for fiscal 2024 reflecting a further increase in annual revenues of which also became effective December 13, 2023. On October 25, 2024, Spire Gulf made its annual RSE filing (based on its budget for fiscal 2025 reflecting a further increase in annual revenues of , pending regulatory review. Spire Gulf s CCM has evaluation and recovery provisions when expenses exceed or are under a band of plus or minus around the CPI-U inflated O M per customer expense level from the base year, excluding expenses for pensions and gas bad debt. The base year for the O M index was 2021 for fiscal 2022. Since a CCM benefit was recorded in fiscal 2022, the base year O M index for fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2025 will be the 2022 O M level. A CCM benefit of was recorded for fiscal 2022 to an economic development fund that can be used for economic development purposes subject to APSC approval. Spire Gulf s O M for fiscal 2023 and 2024 was within the O M per customer inflation adjusted band. Spire Gulf has a Cast Iron Main Replacement Factor (CIF) that provides an enhanced return on the pro-rata costs associated with cast iron main replacement exceeding 10 miles per year based on a weighting for the equity content. Capital expenditures recovered under the CIF have not increased since fiscal 2019 pursuant to applicable tariff provisions although the Company is continuing to recover costs of service associated with accumulated expenditures under the CIF. Spire Gulf also has an ESR for negative revenue variances over or a force majeure event expense of (or two events that exceed and an Environmental Cost Recovery Factor that recovers of prudently incurred costs for compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations. Spire Gulf has an APSC-approved intercompany revolving credit agreement with Spire to borrow in a principal amount not to exceed and to loan up to . 
 
 Spire Mississippi utilizes a formula rate-making process under the Rate Stabilization Adjustment Rider (RSA). An allowed return on equity (currently is computed annually and compared to the actual return on equity based on a rate year ending June 30. If the actual equity return on an end of period rate base is beyond the allowed return on equity by , then of any shortfall is recovered through a rate increase and of any excess results in a rate decrease. Updates may include known and measurable adjustments to historic costs from the 12 months ended June 30, submitted September 15 for an effective date of November 1, unless disputed by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff (MPUS), with any disputes to be resolved by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC) by January 15 of the following year. The MSPSC approved stipulation agreements between the MPUS and Spire Mississippi that provided for increased annual revenues of , and through rates effective on February 1, 2022, January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024, respectively. Spire Mississippi s RSA filing made on September 4, 2024 reflected a further rate increase of and is pending review by the MPUS. Additionally, a Supplemental Growth Rider provides recovery of certain Spire Mississippi system expansion projects to serve qualified economic development projects. 

, and for the Company (excluding commitments between subsidiaries), Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Additional contracts are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season of November through April. The Utilities recover their costs from customers in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders. 
 
 Spire is a limited partner in several unconsolidated partnerships, predominantly focusing on sustainability and development initiatives tied to the natural gas utility sector. Spire committed to contribute a total of of capital to the partnerships as and when requested by the respective general partners. As of September 30, 2024 , the total remaining unfunded commitment was . 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 The Company and the Utilities account for contingencies, including environmental liabilities, in accordance with accounting standards under the loss contingency guidance of ASC Topic 450, Contingencies , when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. 
 
 In addition to matters noted below, the Company and the Utilities are involved in other litigation, claims, and investigations arising in the normal course of business. Management, after discussion with counsel, believes the final outcome will not have a material effect on the statements of income, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows of the Company, Spire Missouri, or Spire Alabama. However, there is uncertainty in the valuation of pending claims and prediction of litigation results. 
 
 The Company and the Utilities own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Company s or Utilities financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations, and their interpretations change, the Company or the Utilities may incur additional environmental liabilities that may result in additional costs, which may be material. 
 
 In the natural gas industry, many gas distribution companies have incurred environmental liabilities associated with sites they or their predecessor companies formerly owned or operated where manufactured gas operations took place. The Utilities each have former manufactured gas plant (MGP) operations in their respective service territories, some of which are discussed under the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama headings below. To the extent costs are incurred associated with environmental remediation activities, the Utilities would request authority from their respective regulators to defer such costs (less any amounts received from insurance proceeds or as contributions from other potentially responsible parties (PRPs)) and collect them through future rates. 
 
 To date, costs incurred for all Spire MGP sites for investigation, remediation and monitoring have not been material. However, the amount of costs relative to future remedial actions at these and other sites is unknown and may be material. The actual future costs that Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama may incur could be materially higher or lower depending upon several factors, including whether remediation will be required, final selection and regulatory approval of any remedial actions, changing technologies and government regulations, the ultimate ability of other PRPs to pay, and any insurance recoveries. 
 
 In 2020, Spire retained an outside consultant to conduct probabilistic cost modeling of its former MGP sites in Missouri and Alabama. The purpose of this analysis was to develop an estimated range of probabilistic future liability for each of their MGP sites. That analysis, completed in March 2021, provided a range of demonstrated possible future expenditures to investigate, monitor and remediate the former MGP sites. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have recorded their best estimates of the probable expenditures that relate to these matters. The amount remains immaterial, and Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the Company do not expect potential liabilities that may arise from remediating these sites to have a material impact on their future financial condition or results of operations. 

Spire Missouri 
 
 Spire Missouri has identified three former MGP sites in the city of St. Louis, Missouri (the City where costs have been incurred and claims have been asserted. Spire Missouri has enrolled two of the sites in the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) Brownfields/Voluntary Cleanup Program (BVCP). The third site is the result of an assertion by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
 
 In conjunction with redevelopment of the Carondelet Coke site, Spire Missouri and another former owner of the site entered into an agreement (the Remediation Agreement with the City development agencies, the developer, and an environmental consultant that obligates one of the City agencies and the environmental consultant to remediate the site and obtain a No Further Action (NFA) letter from the MoDNR. The Remediation Agreement also provides for a release of Spire Missouri and the other former site owner from certain liabilities related to the past and current environmental condition of the site and requires the developer and the environmental consultant to maintain certain insurance coverage, including remediation cost containment, premises pollution liability, and professional liability. The operative provisions of the Remediation Agreement were triggered on December 20, 2010, on which date Spire Missouri and the other former site owner, as full consideration under the Remediation Agreement, paid a small percentage of the cost of remediation of the site. The property was divided into seven parcels, and MoDNR NFA letters have been received for six of the parcels. Remediation is ongoing on the last parcel. 
 
 In May 2023, Spire Missouri was approached by a real estate developer interested in purchasing the northern half of the second site, Station A, and developing the same for industrial purposes. Consequently, Spire Missouri entered into a cost sharing agreement for remedial investigation with other PRPs. The site developer, Spire Missouri and the PRPs collectively designed a site investigation plan which was submitted to the MoDNR and approved by the agency on August 27, 2024. Contracts with an environmental engineering firm are almost completed and once finalized, the site investigation process will begin. 
 
 Additionally, in correspondence dated November 30, 2016, Region 7 of the EPA has asserted that Spire Missouri is liable under Section 107 (a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) for alleged coal gas waste contamination at a third site, Station B. Spire Missouri and the site owner notified the EPA that information and data provided by the EPA to date does not rise to the level of documenting a threat to the public health or environment. As such, in March 2017 Spire Missouri requested more information from the EPA. Spire Missouri never received a response from the EPA. 
 
 Spire Missouri has notified its insurers that it seeks reimbursement for costs incurred in the past and future potential liabilities associated with these MGP sites. While some of the insurers have denied coverage and reserved their rights, Spire Missouri retains the right to seek potential reimbursements from them. 
 
 On March 10, 2015, Spire Missouri received a Section 104 (e) information request under CERCLA from EPA Region 7 regarding the former Thompson Chemical/Superior Solvents site in the City. In turn, Spire Missouri issued a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the EPA on April 3, 2015, to identify the basis of the inquiry. The FOIA response from the EPA was received on July 15, 2015, and a response was provided to the EPA on August 15, 2015. Spire Missouri has received no further inquiry from the EPA regarding this matter. 
 
 In its western service area, Spire Missouri has six owned MGP sites enrolled in the BVCP, including Joplin MGP #1, St. Joseph MGP #1, Kansas City Coal Gas Station B, Kansas City Station A Railroad area, Kansas City Coal Gas Station A, and Independence MGP #2. Source removal has been conducted at all the owned sites since 2003 with the exception of Joplin. On September 15, 2016, a request was made with the MoDNR for a restrictive covenant use limitation with respect to Joplin. Remediation efforts at the six sites are at various stages of completion, ranging from groundwater monitoring and sampling following source removal activities to the aforementioned request for the Joplin site. As part of its participation in the BVCP, Spire Missouri communicates regularly with the MoDNR with respect to its remediation efforts and monitoring activities at these sites. On May 11, 2015, MoDNR approved the next phase of investigation at the Kansas City Station A Railroad area. 

Spire Alabama 
 
 Spire Alabama is in the chain of title of nine former MGP sites, four of which it still owns, and five former manufactured gas distribution sites, one of which it still owns. All are located in the state of Alabama. 
 
 In 2011, a removal action was completed and an NFA letter was received at the Huntsville MGP site pursuant to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent among the EPA, Spire Alabama and the current site owner. 
 
 In 2012, Spire Alabama responded to an EPA Request for Information Pursuant to Section 104 of CERCLA relating to the 35th Avenue Superfund Site located in North Birmingham, Jefferson County, Alabama. Spire Alabama was identified as a PRP under CERCLA for the cleanup of the site or costs the EPA incurs in cleaning up the site. At this point, Spire Alabama has not been provided information that would allow it to determine the extent, if any, of its potential liability with respect to the 35th Avenue Superfund Site and vigorously denies its inclusion as a PRP. 
 
 Assessments were performed by the EPA of the former MGP sites in Gadsden and Anniston, and NFA letters were received after each assessment. 
 
 Spire 
 
 In addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is aware of the following contingent matters. 
 
 Spire Marketing, along with many natural gas industry participants, faced the unprecedented effects of Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. Numerous natural gas producers and midstream operators were unable to deliver natural gas to market as they experienced wellhead freeze-offs, power outages and equipment failure due to the extreme weather. These events resulted in supply curtailments, and related notices of force majeure to excuse performance, from and to certain counterparties. Further, these events made Spire Marketing subject to various ongoing commercial disputes (including regarding force majeure). All filed litigation disputes have been resolved, and Spire Marketing has recorded the agreed-upon liabilities as of September 30, 2024, which are not materially different from amounts previously accrued.

 Thereafter 
 Total undiscounted lease payments 
 Less present value discount 
 Total current and noncurrent lease liabilities 

There are no significant finance leases, short-term leases, subleases, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants pertaining to leases. 
 
 The Company elected, for all asset classes, not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases. Instead, the lease payments for short-term leases are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company elected, for all asset classes, not to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead to account for each separate lease component and the nonlease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component. 
 
 The discount rate used for all the leases is the applicable incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. For a subsidiary lessee, the rate applicable to the subsidiary is used unless the lease terms are influenced by parent credit.

Exhibit 19 

Purchases and Sales of Securities and Prevention of Selective Disclosure Policy 

1. Policy Statement 

1.1. If you are aware of any material development at Spire Inc. or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries that is not a matter of general public knowledge, you should not make any purchases or sales of Company securities or engage in any other transaction to take personal advantage of that information and you should not disclose the existence or content of that information to others outside the Company, including family, social acquaintances or business associates. The purchase or sale of securities while possessing material nonpublic information or the selective disclosure of such information to others who may trade is prohibited by federal and state laws. Further, you may not engage in any hedging transactions with respect to the Company s securities. Pledging of Company stock is also prohibited for Company executive officers and Board members. 

1.2. As part of your responsibilities and duties, you may also have access to material nonpublic information about other companies such as our customers, suppliers and business partners. The same prohibitions apply to trading in another company s securities and disclosing the existence or content of that information relative to such company to others. 

1.3. This policy applies to the Board of Directors and all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

2. Material Nonpublic Information 

2.1. What is material information? 

2.1.1. Material information is any information that an investor might consider important in deciding to buy, hold or sell securities; in short, it is any information that if disclosed could be expected to affect the price of the stock. Examples of information that will frequently be regarded as material are: 

 2.1.1.1. significant changes in the company s prospects, 

 2.1.1.2. dividend rates and changes in dividend rates, 

 2.1.1.3. earnings results, 

 2.1.1.4. significant write-down in assets, 

 2.1.1.5. significant changes in earnings expectations, 

 2.1.1.6. defaults in, or noncompliance with, debt covenants, 

 2.1.1.7. impending bankruptcy or liquidity problems, 

 2.1.1.8. proposals, plans or agreements, even if preliminary in nature, involving significant acquisitions, mergers, dispositions or tender offer, divestitures, recapitalizations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, or purchases or sales of substantial assets, 

 2.1.1.9. public offerings, 

 2.1.1.10. major new products, 

 2.1.1.11. major personnel changes, 

 2.1.1.12. significant litigation or government investigations, or 

 2.1.1.13. the gain or loss of a substantial customer or supplier. 

2.2. What is nonpublic information? 

2.2.1. Nonpublic information is any information that has not been formally disclosed to the general public. To show that material information is public, it is generally necessary to point to some fact verifying that the information has become generally available, such as disclosure by filing of a Form 10-Q, Form 10-K, Form 8-K or other report with the SEC, or disclosure by release to a national business and financial wire service (such as BusinessWire, Reuters or Bloomberg), a national news service, or a national newspaper (such as The Wall Street Journal). The circulation of rumors, Internet chat or talk on the street, even if accurate, widespread and reported in the media, does not constitute the requisite public disclosure, nor does the mere posting of the information on an Internet web site (other than the SEC s). 

2.2.2. Material information improperly disclosed only to institutional investors or to a favored analyst or a group of analysts retains its status as nonpublic information and constitutes a violation of the SEC s prohibition against selective disclosure. So long as any material component of the inside information has yet to be publicly disclosed, the information is deemed nonpublic. Not only must the information have been publicly disclosed, but there must also have been adequate time for the market as a whole to digest the information. A good rule of thumb is that information is considered nonpublic until the second business day after public disclosure, although timing may vary depending on the circumstances. 

3. Hedging and Pledging 

3.1. Hedging transactions may permit an employee or director of the Company to continue to own the securities of the Company, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the director or employee may no longer have the same objectives as the Company s other stockholders. Therefore, executive officers and board members are prohibited from entering into hedging transactions with respect to Company securities, including, without limitation, through the use of financial instruments such as exchange funds, prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, puts, calls, collars, forwards and other derivative instruments, or through the establishment of a short position in the Company s securities. 

3.2. Pledging of Company stock may occur through shares held in a margin account or used as collateral for a loan. These shares may be sold for failure to meet a margin call or default on a loan. Because a margin sale or default sale may occur at a time when an employee or director is aware of material, non-public information or otherwise is not permitted under this Policy, executive officers and board members are prohibited from holding Company stock in a margin account or pledging Company stock as collateral for a loan. 

4. Unauthorized Disclosure of Information 

4.1. The Company is required by law not to selectively disclose material nonpublic information and has established procedures for releasing material nonpublic information in a manner that is designed to achieve broad public dissemination of the information upon its release. Therefore, you should not discuss the existence or content of material, nonpublic information about the Company or its affiliates or subsidiaries with anyone, including fellow employees, family, social acquaintances and other business associates. Further you should not share information, whether or not material, about the Company, its employees, customers, or vendors with others outside of the Company if they have no need to know that information. 

4.2. Similarly, you should not discuss Company affairs in public or quasi-public areas where your conversation may be overheard (e.g., car services, airplanes, restaurants, restrooms, elevators, etc.). Like conversations in public or quasi-public areas, e-mail, internal or external, is not a confidential media for communication. You also should not discuss the Company or its business in an internet chat room or similar internet-based forum, including through social media. 

4.3. Inquiries about the Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries from the press, investment analysts or others in the financial community, including shareholders should be directed to authorized individuals. If you receive any inquiries of this nature, you should decline comment and refer the inquirer to the Managing Director, Investor Relations if they are related to the Company s securities and to the Manager External Communications for all other inquiries. 

4.4. If material nonpublic information is inadvertently disclosed, no matter what the circumstances, by any Company director, officer or employee, the person making or discovering that disclosure should immediately report the facts to the Corporate Secretary of the Company. Under federal securities laws, the Company generally must make public disclosure of any material nonpublic information that was inadvertently disclosed no later than 24 hours after discovery of the inadvertent disclosure. 

5. Pre-Clear All Trades 

5.1. To assist you in preventing inadvertent violations and to attempt to avoid the appearance of an improper transaction (which could result, for example, where an officer engages in a trade while unaware of a pending major development), all employees reporting directly to a managing director or above and other employees who may have access to material nonpublic information should pre-clear any transaction involving Company securities by completing, signing and submitting to the Corporate Secretary the Spire Securities Preclearance Request Form, which is attached to this Policy. Pre-approval does not constitute legal advice and does not in any way relieve you from your obligations under the securities laws. 

5.2. Members of the Board of Directors and those officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, together with their family members, may not engage in any transaction involving the Company s securities (including a stock plan transaction such as movement of funds into or out of the Company Stock Fund of the 401(k) plans, an option exercise, gift, loan or pledge or hedge, contribution to a trust, or any other transfer) without first pre-clearing the transaction by completing, signing and submitting to the Corporate Secretary the Spire Securities Preclearance Request Form, which is attached to this Policy. Further, because of the accelerated reporting requirements, directors and those officers subject to Section 16 need to maintain current broker contact information with the Corporate Secretary. This requirement does not apply to periodic or regular purchases through the Company Stock Fund in any of the 401(k) Plans or the acquisition of shares solely through the dividend reinvestment feature of the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. 

5.3. The pre-clearance requirements above and the blackout periods described below do not apply to trades that are executed pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 sales plan that is pre-cleared with the Corporate Secretary. Rule 10b5-1 provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability under the federal securities laws for trading plans that meet certain requirements. You are advised to seek personal counsel if you choose to enter into a Rule 10b5-1 plan. These plans may only be adopted during a non-blackout period when not in possession of any material nonpublic information, and the plans must be cleared in advance by the Corporate Secretary. Once a plan is adopted, the insider must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded, or the date of the trade. See the Guidelines for Rule 10b5-1 Plans. NOTE: Those subject to Section 16 remain subject to Section 16 liability and reporting obligations as well as Rule 144 compliance and filing requirements. 

6. Timing 

6.1. The New York Stock Exchange offers various guidelines for those contemplating securities transactions, but there is no simple, uniform rule that applies. Basically, the Exchange s suggestions are guided by a sense of fairness to all segments of the investing public, and each case must be judged on its own merits. Set forth below are some general guidelines that we utilize internally for determining when trades may occur: 

6.1.1. Under most circumstances, trading should be possible during a period that begins on the third business day after the Company releases its quarterly or annual earnings and closes at the close of business on the 15th of the last month of the quarter. For example, if the earnings release for the fiscal year end is issued before the market opens on a Friday in October, the window will open the following Tuesday and remain open until the 15th of December. 

6.1.2. Directors and officers will probably not be able to trade other than during the window described above. Even during these days of the year, there may still be times when transactions may not be appropriate. For example, if the trading window opens on August 1 but the Company has a draft settlement of a rate case that all parties have agreed to but it has not yet been made public, trading will not be allowed until that material information becomes public. 

6.1.2.1. Generally, directors and executive officers may not purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer any Company equity security during a pension plan blackout period that temporarily prevents plan participants or beneficiaries from engaging in transactions involving the Company s common stock through their plan accounts. The Company must notify the directors and executive officers, as well as the SEC, in advance of a blackout period. 

Remember, you may not buy or sell Company securities even during any of the above window periods if you are in possession of material nonpublic information. 

7. Consequences of Violations 

7.1. You should be aware that the New York Stock Exchange maintains a sophisticated continuous market surveillance program that has an impressive record for tracking down suspected abuses. 

7.2. If your securities transactions become the subject of scrutiny, they will be viewed after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. As a result, before engaging in any transaction you should carefully consider how regulators and others might view your transaction in hindsight. If a violation is found, you may be subject to significant civil penalties, criminal fines and jail term. Further, violations of this policy will subject you to discipline by the Company up to and including discharge. 

8. Company Assistance 

8.1. Any person who has any questions about specific transactions may obtain additional guidance from the Corporate Secretary. Remember, however, that the ultimate responsibility for adhering to the policy and avoiding improper transactions is your personal obligation. 

8.2. On an annual basis you will be asked to confirm your understanding of this policy. 

Guidelines for Rule 10b5-1 Plans 

Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides a defense from insider trading liability under Rule 10b-5. To be eligible to rely on this defense, a person subject to this Policy must enter into a Rule 10b5 1 plan for transactions in Company securities that meets certain conditions specified in the Rule (a Rule 10b5-1 Plan or Plan ). If the Plan meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1, Company securities may be purchased or sold without regard to certain insider trading restrictions. In general, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be entered into at a time when the person entering into the Plan is not aware of material nonpublic information. Once the Plan is adopted, the person must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded, or the date of the trade. The Plan must either specify the amount, pricing and time of transactions in advance or delegate discretion on these matters to an independent third party. 

Note: These Plans are individual plans, not Company plans. You should work with your personal counsel in implementing such a Plan. 

As specified in the Company s Policy Regarding Purchases and Sales of Securities and Prevention of Selective Disclosure, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be pre-cleared with the Corporate Secretary and meet the requirements of these guidelines. Any Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be submitted for pre-clearance five business days prior to entry into the Plan. No further pre-approval of transactions conducted pursuant to the Rule 10b5-1 Plan will be required. 

The following guidelines apply to all Rule 10b5-1 Plans: 

You may not enter into, modify or terminate a Plan during a blackout period or while in possession of material nonpublic information. 

All Rule 10b5-1 Plans must have a duration of at least 6 months. 

If a Rule 10b5-1 Plan is terminated, you must wait at least 30 days before trading outside of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan. 

If a Plan is terminated, you must wait until the next window opens for trading before a new Rule 10b5-1 Plan may be adopted. 

You may not commence sales under a Plan until at least 30 days following the date of establishment of the Plan. Any modification of a Plan must not take effect for at least 30 days from the date of modification. 

You may not enter into any transaction in Company securities covered by a Rule 10b5-1 Plan while the Plan is in effect. 

Each director, officer and other Section 16 insider must understand that the adoption of a Plan in no way reduces or eliminates such person s obligations under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including such person s disclosure and short-swing trading liabilities thereunder, or under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Any questions regarding implementing a Rule 10b5-1 Plan should be referred to your personal counsel.
