 Overview of Our Business 
 At September 30, 2024, we operated a total of 1,279 locations, consisting of: 
 542 U.S. pawn stores (operating primarily as EZPAWN or Value Pawn Jewelry); 
 565 Mexico pawn stores (operating primarily as Empe o F cil and Cash Apoyo Efectivo); and 
 172 pawn stores in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (operating as GuatePrenda and MaxiEfectivo). 
 At our pawn stores, we advance cash against the value of collateralized tangible personal property and sell merchandise to customers looking for good value. The merchandise we sell primarily consists of pre-owned collateral forfeited from our pawn activities or merchandise purchased from customers. By store count, we ar e the second la rgest pawn store owner and operator in the U.S. and one of the largest in Latin America. We also offer web-based applications under the name EZ+ that allow customers to manage their pawn transactions, layaways and loyalty rewards online. 
 In addition to our core pawn business in the U.S. and Latin America, we have made the following strategic investments: 
 We own 43.7 of Cash Converters International Limited Cash Converters ), a publicly traded company (ASX: CCV) headquartered in Perth, Western Australia. Cash Converters and its controlled companies comprise a diverse group generating revenues from franchising, store operations, personal finance (including pawn transactions) and vehicle finance in 669 stores across 17 countries. 
 We own a preferred interest in Founders One, LLC Founders that has majority ownership in Simple Management Group, Inc. SMG ), which owns and operates 102 pawn stores in the U.S., Caribbean and Central America, with plans to build and acquire more stores in those regions. 
 We generate revenues primarily from pawn service charges PSC on pawn loans outstanding PLO ), merchandise sales and jewelry scrapping. We remain focused on optimizing our balance of PLO and the resulting higher PSC.

 Pawn Activities 
 At our pawn stores, we advance cash against the value of collateralized tangible personal property. We earn pawn service charges PSC for those cash advances, and the PSC rate varies by state and transaction size. At the time of the transaction, we take possession of the pawned collateral, which consists of tangible personal property, generally jewelry, consumer electronics, tools, sporting goods and musical instruments. If the customer chooses to redeem their pawn, they will repay the amount advanced plus any accrued PSC. If the customer chooses not to redeem their pawn, the pawned collateral becomes our inventory, which we sell in our retail merchandise sales activities or, in some cases, scrap for its inherent gold or precious stone content. Consequently, the success of our pawn business is largely dependent on our ability to accurately assess the probability of pawn redemption and the estimated resale or scrap value of the collateralized personal property. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a closing PLO balance of 274.1 million. In fiscal 2024, PSC accounted for approximately 38 of our total revenues and 64 of our gross profit. 
 In the U.S., PSC rates generally vary between 12 and 25 per month as permitted by applicable law, and the pawn term generally ranges between 30 and 90 days. Individual pawn transactions typically average between 170 and 200. 
 In Mexico, PSC rates generally vary between 15 and 21 per month as permitted by applicable law, and the pawn primary term is 30 days. Individual pawn transactions typically average between 1,200 and 1,500 Mexican pesos, or approximately 65 to 85 on average using the average exchange rate for fiscal 2024. 
 In GPMX, PSC rates generally vary between 12 and 18 per month as permitted by applicable law, and the pawn primary term is 30 days. Individual pawn transactions are made in the local currency of the country and typically average between 120 and 140 using the average exchange rates for fiscal 2024. The average transaction amounts tend to be higher in the GPMX countries than in Mexico due to the higher concentration of jewelry used as pawn collateral. 
 If a customer chooses not to redeem, renew or extend their pawn, the pawn collateral is forfeited and becomes inventory available for sale. We do not record losses or charge-offs when the pawned collateral is forfeited because the amount advanced for the unpaid pawn becomes the inventory carrying cost of the forfeited collateral. The difference between the subsequent sale of the forfeited collateral and the amount of the pawn (offset by any inventory reserve) is reflected in merchandise sales gross margin. 
 Our ability to offer quality pre-owned goods at prices significantly lower than original retail prices attracts value-conscious customers. The gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on our assessment of the estimated resale or scrap value at the time the property is either accepted as pawn collateral or purchased and our ability to sell that merchandise in a timely manner. As a significant portion of our inventory and sales involve gold and jewelry, our results can be influenced by the market price of gold and diamonds. 
 Customers in the U.S. and the majority of our Latin America stores may purchase a product protection plan that allows them to exchange certain general merchandise (non-jewelry) sold through our retail pawn operations within six months of purchase. In the U.S., we also offer a jewelry VIP package, which guarantees customers a minimum future pawn advance amount on the item sold, allows them full credit if they trade in the item to purchase a more expensive piece of jewelry and provides minor repair service on the item sold. Customers may also purchase an item on layaway by paying a minimum layaway deposit of typically 10 of the item s sale price, in addition to an upfront fee. We typically hold items on layaway for a 90-180 day period, during which the customer is required to pay the balance of the sales price through a series of installment payments. If a payment is missed, we hold the item for up to 30 days, after which it is returned to active inventory for sale. 
 
 Operations and Risk Management 
 Our pawn operations are designed to provide the optimum level of support to the store teams, providing coaching, mentoring and problem solving to identify opportunities to better serve our customers and position us to be the leader in customer service and satisfaction. 
 Our risk management structure consists of asset protection, compliance and internal audit departments, which monitor the inventory system, lending practices, regulatory compliance and compliance with our policies and procedures. We perform full physical audits of inventory at each store at least annually, and more often in higher risk stores or those experiencing higher shrinkage. Inventory counts are completed daily for jewelry and firearms, and other inventory categories more susceptible to theft are cycle counted multiple times annually. We record shrink adjustments for known losses at the conclusion of each inventory count. These adjustments are recorded as estimates during interim periods and as discovered during cycle counts.

 Human Capital Management 
 Engagement Survey 
 We performed a Global Employee Engagement Survey, administered by Glint, in April 2024, and had a 87 participation rate with an overall engagement score of 84. Our engagement score is ten points higher than the global benchmark, which contains data from over 1,100 companies of varying size across a variety of industries (Finance, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Professional Services, Retail, Technology and Utilities) and includes results from over eight million respondents located in over 150 countries. 
 Our top strengths were Career, Customer Focus and Continuous Improvement. Our focus areas for improvement included Team, Valued Teammate and Work-Life Balance. Team Members provided over 11,900 comments with mixed sentiment, 27 positive, 38 neutral and 35 negative. To ensure we address issues raised in the survey, all people leaders at the District Manager and above level will have Engagement Objectives for fiscal 2025 guided by actions that will yield the greatest business and Team Member impact. 
 Talent Management and Development 
 We employ approximately 8,000 Team Members across all our geographies, including approximately 3,600 in United States, 3,500 in Mexico and 900 in Central America. We seek to hire and promote Team Members to lead the way today and to step into greater roles in the future. We achieve this goal through Training and Development programs that Team Members can use to plan their careers and identify future growth opportunities. We engage Team Members at all levels so we can understand their professional and personal goals, identify high potential future leaders to strengthen our internal bench, support them in their journey and retain our talent. 
 In our pawn stores we provide: 
 An onboarding program that blends online and hands-on training in the art and science of pawnbroking; 
 Career path programs aligned with our talent and succession strategy, emphasizing career progression and individual development programs; and 
 A learning experience that unlocks and accelerates Team Member potential as well as business growth. 
 Our investment in store-level Team Members produced tangible results during fiscal 2024: 
 High scoring questions in our 2024 Global Employee Engagement Survey included I know the career path(s) available to me at EZCORP (with an 89 favorability rating) and I have good opportunities to learn and develop at EZCORP (with an 86 favorability rating). 
 Over 85 of managerial positions were filled via internal promotion. 
 We reinforced the utilization of our career path (Operations) and career and competency framework (Corporate Support Center) to build individual development plans to guide the career paths of Team Members and to prepare them for future roles. 
 Culture and Ethics 
 Culture is critical to our long-term success and to our ability to attract, develop and retain the top talent needed to accomplish our Purpose, Vision and Strategy. 
 
 Our values People, Pawn, Passion define our priorities as a business, and our Guiding Principles Leadership, Customer Service, Accountability, Respect, Diversity and Sustainability characterize the expectations for how we interact with Team Members, customers and communities. Various tools are used globally to demonstrate commitment to our principles, values and positive culture, including a plain-language Code of Conduct and supporting policies, annual training on expectations and clear communications from executive management reinforcing ethical behavior and a positive culture. 
 To support our ethical business practices, we maintain an Ethics Hotline available to all Team Members and external stakeholders to report (anonymously if desired) any matter of concern. Communications to the hotline (which is managed by an independent third party) are routed to appropriate functions (whether Human Resources, Legal or Compliance), and in some cases directly to the Board of Directors, for investigation and resolution. In addition, any shareholder or other interested party may send communications to the Board of Directors, either individually or as a group, through a process that is outlined in the Investor Relations section of our website.

 Diversity and Inclusion 
 At EZCORP, we foster an environment that values diversity, inclusion and development for all. In our 2024 Global Employee Engagement Survey, 83 of participants responded positively to the question, I feel a sense of belonging at EZCORP. In fiscal 2024, we continued to further our Diversity and Inclusion strategy by focusing on the following initiatives: 
 Commitment and Accountability Demonstrate commitment and accountability through corporate policy, communications and actions. 
 Workplace Inclusion Foster work environments that value diversity and inclusion and encourage collaboration, flexibility and fairness. 
 Diverse Workforce Recruit and promote from diverse, qualified candidate pools to increase diversity of perspectives and experiences. 
 We sponsor affinity groups to foster an inclusive and supportive environment, where Team Members with shared characteristics, experiences or interests can connect, collaborate and contribute effectively. The Women s Empowerment, Black Empowerment, Hispanic Organization for Leadership Advocacy (HOLA) and EZ Pride affinity groups in the U.S. and the Women s Empowerment and Working Parents affinity groups in Latin America all aim to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion efforts by providing a platform for open dialogue, resource-sharing, professional development and cultural enrichment.

 Total Rewards 
 Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of Team Members with individual and Company performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate Team Members to achieve results. 
 The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically: 
 We provide wages and incentive plans that are competitive and consistent with positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. Additionally, on an annual basis (U.S.) gender and racial/ethnic analysis is performed to ensure pay equity. 
 We engage a nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firm to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and to provide benchmarking against our selected peer group, which includes similarly-sized companies from relevant industries that serve similar customer bases, operate in the retail or consumer finance industries and typically have similar operating dynamics. 
 We align our executives long-term equity compensation with our shareholders interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance. 
 All employees are eligible for paid time off, Company-paid life insurance and participation in a tenure award program which recognizes their commitment and loyalty by awarding EZ+ Rewards points based on their years of service. 
 Health and Safety 
 Our commitment to our Team Members is to provide a safe and injury-free workplace. We continue to invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental and social well-being. 
 Management and Oversight 
 The People and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has primary responsibility for analyzing, advising and (as appropriate) approving executive compensation. The committee is also responsible for organizational development matters and otherwise assisting the Board of Directors in its overall responsibility to enable EZCORP to attract, retain, develop and motivate qualified executives who will contribute to the long-term success of the Company. 
 The committee actively participates in the executive recruitment and selection process. Committee members are instrumental in the executive talent management and succession processes, including the review and attainment of annual objectives for our executive officers. All executive officers have a minimum of one objective related to People, generally broken into the areas of Employee Engagement Scores, Voluntary Attrition and Inclusion. 
 
 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
 EZCORP is committed to meeting our customers needs in a responsible manner, and in that regard, we have aligned purpose, vision, values, guiding principles and business strategy with environmental, social and governance sustainability factors. 
 Our pawnbroking and related retail sales activities inherently contribute to the circular economy and promote environmental sustainability. We provide unique options for our customers to satisfy their needs for cash options that are not offered by traditional lenders such as banks and credit unions, credit card providers, or installment and short-term lenders. For many of our customers, pawn transactions provide an essential and financially responsible lifeline for meeting their unexpected expenses. Our retail activities rely primarily on local sourcing of pre-owned merchandise and the recirculation of those items back into the neighborhoods we serve. In short, our business is unique, essential and sustainable. 
 Environmental Sustainability 
 Our business contributes to overall environmental sustainability in the following ways: 
 Our business is fundamentally a neighborhood business, where each store principally serves the surrounding neighborhood. This local focus reduces the need of our customers to travel long distances to access our products and services and eliminates the need for delivery services. 
 Each of our stores serves as its own supply chain. We take in pre-owned merchandise, either through pawn or purchases from customers, and then sell that merchandise (after forfeiture, in the case of pawn transactions), generally in the same store. Thus, we do not maintain or rely on mass supply, distribution or warehousing facilities. 
 9 

Table of Contents 

 Virtually all of the merchandise we sell is pre-owned, which contributes to pre-owned goods recycling and the circular economy. In fiscal 2024, we sold approximately 5.2 million pre-owned items, including over 2.9 million items in the consumer electronics, camera and household goods categories, 1.4 million other general merchandise items (such as tools and musical instruments) and 0.8 million jewelry items. In addition, through our jewelry scrapping activities, we recycle significant volumes of gold and diamonds. All of these activities effectively extend the useful life of many products, reducing waste and lessening the demand for new manufacturing and mining. 
 Our store operations themselves leave a relatively small carbon footprint when compared to big-box or other mass retailers that rely on manufacturers and extensive supply chain and distribution channels. Our stores are relatively small (generally 3,300 square feet or less). To reduce energy consumption, we have installed energy-efficient LED lighting in 78 of our U.S. stores and 62 of Latin America stores. 
 In all of our facilities, including our corporate support offices, we promote environmental stewardship by reducing consumption, recycling paper products (approximately 1 million pounds across all U.S. locations during fiscal 2024) and responsibly disposing of end-of-life computers, electronics and related accessories through recycling or other sound e-waste processing. Our corporate office in Austin, Texas is LEED Certified Silver status. 
 Social Responsibility 
 Our business promotes social responsibility in the following ways: 
 Our business serves as an essential and responsible financial resource for unbanked and or underserved consumers who have limited access to traditional forms of capital or credit. We improve the reach and access to financial services through neighborhood-based stores, supported by digital offerings. We provide instant access to cash in transactions that generally average 185 in the U.S. Our pawn transactions are simple, transparent, regulated and safe, and funding approval is based on the valuation of the collateral item, not on the credit worthiness of the customer. The customer is not required to repay the amount advanced; rather, the customer may choose to repay the amount advanced and the PSC or forfeit the collateralized merchandise. We do not engage in collection efforts or take other legal actions against our customers, and we do not report transaction histories to external credit agencies. 
 Customer satisfaction measurement and feedback are key factors in improving our customer service and Team Member engagement. To capture direct customer feedback, we have enabled Google Reviews across all stores and have received over 349,000 Google reviews with an average satisfaction rating of 4.8 out of 5 across U.S and Latin America. 
 We offer customers multiple payment options, including cross-store, over-the-phone and web-based and mobile platforms, reducing the need to travel to stores to make payments. Online payments are accepted on layaways and pawn extensions, with electronic payment receipts delivered on these transactions. 
 We have refreshed the mission of EZCORP Foundation, our philanthropic arm that is focused on making a difference in communities where we live and operate by supporting charitable organizations that align with our operating values of People, Pawn and Passion. Current initiatives include supporting financial literacy efforts, working to eradicate food insecurity, empowering young people to succeed and other poverty intervention activities. 
 For a discussion of our Diversity and Inclusion initiatives, see Human Capital Management Diversity and Inclusion above. 
 Governance 
 At EZCORP, we believe that The Way We Do Business is as Important as the Business We Do. That belief underlies our Code of Conduct, which outlines our expectations and provides guidance on how our Team Members can carry out their daily activities ethically and responsibly. Our ethical principles include Honesty, Integrity, Reliability, Loyalty, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, Leadership and Diversity, and these principles form the foundation for how we govern our business. 
 Even though we are a Controlled Company under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we maintain the governance standards required of all publicly-listed Nasdaq companies, including: 
 Independent directors comprise a majority of our Board of Directors. Four of the seven members of our Board of Directors meet all of the independence requirements set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and none of the independent directors have any past or existing relationship with our controlling stockholder outside of their Board service. 
 All of our standing Board committees (Audit and Risk Committee, People and Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee) are comprised of solely independent directors. 
 We satisfy Nasdaq s board diversity rules, with two of our seven Board members being diverse directors, one of whom self-identifies as female and an underrepresented minority and one whom self-identifies as an underrepresented minority.

 For further discussion of our corporate governance standards, see Part III, Item 10 Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance. 
 Our pawn operations are licensed and supervised in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We maintain a strong compliance culture that is monitored and overseen by our Board of Directors and supported by seasoned regulatory and compliance teams. 
 Protecting the privacy, integrity and security of our customers data and our enterprise network is a top priority that is also monitored and overseen by our Board of Directors. We maintain a separate IT Security team that is responsible for the design and implementation of our cyber risk strategy, including deployment of systems, enterprise-wide training, monitoring and reporting of threat incidents and response preparedness. 
 
 Growth and Expansion 
 Part of our strategy is to grow the number of locations we operate through opening new de novo locations and through acquisitions in both Latin America and the U.S. and potential new markets. Our ability to add new stores is dependent on several variables, such as projected achievement of internal investment hurdles, the availability of acceptable sites or acquisition candidates, the alignment of acquirer/seller price expectations, the regulatory environment, local zoning ordinances, access to capital and availability of qualified personnel. 
 During fiscal 2024, we continued our expansion in Latin America and the U.S. with the opening of 41 de novo stores (20 in Mexico, 17 in Guatemala, 3 in Honduras and 1 in Nevada) and the acquisition of 13 stores in the U.S. We also consolidated 6 stores, 5 in Latin America and 1 in the U.S. We now own a total of 1,279 stores, 737 in Latin America (58 and 542 in the U.S. (42 ). In fiscal 2024, the Latin America stores represented 27 of our consolidated gross profit as the average scale of Latin America pawn stores is smaller than in the U.S. We see opportunity for further expansion in Latin America and the U.S. through both acquisitions and de novo openings. 
 
 Seasonality and Quarterly Results 
 In the U.S., PSC is historically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter (July through September) due to a higher average PLO balance during the summer and lowest in our third fiscal quarter (April through June) following the tax refund season, and merchandise sales are highest in our first and second fiscal quarters (October through March) due to the holiday season, jewelry sales surrounding Valentine s Day and the availability of tax refunds. In Latin America, most of our customers receive additional compensation from their employers in December, and many receive additional compensation in June or July, applying downward pressure on PLO balances and fueling some merchandise sales in those periods. In Mexico, we saw similar downward pressure in loan balances during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due to a change in law related to company profit sharing payments to employees. We anticipated this change would impact pawn loan redemptions annually in May and June; however, in fiscal 2024, the demand for pawn loans in Mexico exceeded any downward pressure related to profit sharing payments. As a net effect of these and other factors and excluding discrete charges, our consolidated income before tax is generally highest in our first fiscal quarter (October through December) and lowest in our third fiscal quarter (April through June). 
 
 Competition 
 We encounter significant competition in connection with all of our activities. These competitive conditions may have an impact on our revenues, profitability and ability to expand. We compete with other pawn stores, credit service organizations, banks, credit unions and other financial institutions, such as consumer finance companies. We believe the primary elements of competition are the quality of customer service and relationship management, including understanding our customers needs better than anyone else, convenience, store location and a customer-friendly environment. In addition, we believe the ability to compete effectively will be based increasingly on strong general management, regional focus, automated management information systems, access to capital and superior customer service. 
 Our competitors for merchandise sales include numerous retail and wholesale stores such as jewelry stores, discount retail stores, consumer electronics stores, other pawn stores, other resale stores, electronic commerce retailers and auction sites. Competitive factors in our retail operations include the ability to provide customers with a variety of merchandise at considerable value coupled with exceptional customer service and convenient locations. 
 The pawn industry in the U.S. is large, relatively mature and highly fragmented. The industry consists of a few large operators (of which we are the second largest) and then independent operators who primarily own one-to-three locations . 
 The pawn industry in Latin America is also fragmented, but less so than in the U.S. The industry consists of pawn stores owned by independent operators and chains, including some not-for-profit organizations. We are the second largest for-profit operator in Mexico and the largest operator in Guatemala. The pawn industry, particularly full-line stores dealing in both general merchandise and jewelry, remains in an expansion stage in Latin America. 
 We launched our EZ+ Rewards loyalty program in the U.S. and Mexico in 2021 and in GPMX in 2022, and now hav e 5.4 million members globally. This free program allows customers to earn points on most transactions that may be applied as a discount towards retail sales once a certain threshold is met. We believe this program provides a distinct competitive advantage over other pawn operators.

 Regulation 
 Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is an integral part of how we manage our business, and we conduct our business in material compliance with all of these rules. The following is a general description of significant regulations affecting our business. 
 U.S. Regulations 
 Pawn Regulations Our pawn stores are regulated by the states in which they are located and, in some cases, by individual municipalities or other local authorities. The applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations vary from location to location and typically impose licensing requirements for pawn stores or individual pawn store Team Members. Licensing requirements typically relate to financial responsibility and character and may establish restrictions on where pawn stores can operate. Additional rules regulate various aspects of the day-to-day pawn operations, including the pawn service charges that a pawn store may charge, the maximum amount of a pawn loan, the minimum or maximum term of a pawn loan, the content and format of the pawn ticket, and the length of time after a pawn loan default that a pawn store must hold a pawned item before it can be offered for sale. Failure to observe applicable regulations could result in a revocation or suspension of pawn licenses, the imposition of fines or requirements to refund service charges and fees and other civil or criminal penalties. We must also comply with various federal requirements regarding the disclosure of the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments and payment schedule related to each pawn loan transaction. Additional federal regulations applicable to our pawn lending business are described in Other Regulations below. 
 The majority of our pawn stores, voluntarily or pursuant to applicable laws, provide periodic (generally daily) reports to local law enforcement agencies. These reports provide local law enforcement with information about the items received from customers (whether through pawn or purchase), including a detailed description of the goods involved and the name and address of the customer. If we accept as collateral or purchase merchandise from a customer and it is determined that our customer was not the rightful owner, the merchandise is subject to recovery by the rightful owner and those losses are included in our shrinkag e. Historically, we have not experienced a material number of claims of this nature. 
 Some of our pawn stores in the U.S. handle firearms and each of those stores maintains a federal firearms license as required by federal law. The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 and regulations issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also require each pawn store dealing in firearms to maintain a permanent written record of all receipts and dispositions of firearms. In addition, we must comply with the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which requires us to conduct a background check before releasing, selling or otherwise disposing of firearms. 
 Other Regulations Our pawn lending activities are subject to other state and federal statutes and regulations, including the following: 
 We are subject to the Truth in Lending Act TILA ), and its underlying regulations, which requires lenders to disclose information about the terms and costs of credit in a standardized manner, including in the form of an annual percentage rate. The TILA regulations also require us to provide certain disclosure in advertising our products and services. 
 We are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its underlying regulations, as well as various state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. Under these regulations, we are required to disclose to our customers our policies and practices relating to the protection and sharing of customers nonpublic personal information. These regulations also require us to ensure that our systems are designed to protect the confidentiality of customers nonpublic personal information, and many of these regulations dictate certain actions that we must take to notify customers if their personal information is disclosed in an unauthorized manner. In some jurisdictions, we are subject to the laws restricting the scope of data we collect and granting rights to our customers to access, correct, and/or delete the information we obtain. 
 We are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which was enacted, in part, to address privacy concerns associated with the sharing of consumers financial information and credit history contained in consumer credit reports and limits our ability to share certain consumer report information.

 We are subject to the Federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act and requires us to adopt written guidance and procedures for detecting, preventing and mitigating identity theft and to adopt various policies and procedures (including Team Member training) that address and aid in detecting and responding to suspicious activity or identity theft red flags. 
 As a provider of consumer financial products, we are prohibited from engaging in any unfair, deceptive or abusive act or practice (UDAAP) under the Dodd-Frank Act, as they can cause significant financial injury to consumers, erode consumer confidence and undermine the financial marketplace. 
 The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of public assistance or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. 
 Under the USA PATRIOT Act, we must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program that includes the development of internal policies, procedures and controls; the designation of a compliance officer; an ongoing Team Member training program and an independent audit function to test the program. 
 We are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and its underlying regulations, which require us to report and maintain records of certain high-dollar transactions. In addition, federal laws and regulations require us to report certain transactions (or series of transactions) deemed suspicious to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department FinCen ). Generally, a transaction is considered suspicious if we know, suspect or have reason to suspect that the transaction (a) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended to hide or disguise such funds, (b) is designed to evade the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act or (c) appears to serve no legitimate business or lawful purpose. 
 The Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC of the Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. We are prohibited from doing business with named individuals, businesses and countries subject to sanctions and restrictions, and we are required to report any transactions involving those named by the US. Department of the Treasury. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") makes it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. Specifically, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit the willful use of mail or any means of instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of any offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to influence the foreign official in his or her official capacity, induce the foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. 
 The Department of Defense regulations promulgated under the Military Lending Act limit the annual percentage rate charged on certain consumer loans (including pawn loans) made to active military personnel or their dependents to 36 . 
 Under certain circumstances, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB may be able to exercise regulatory authority over the U.S. pawn industry through its rule making authority. To date, the CFPB has not taken any steps to exercise such authority or indicated any intention to do so, although it has initiated actions against pawn companies for alleged violations of consumer lending regulations, including the Military Lending Act discussed above. 
 Mexico Regulations 
 Pawn Regulations Federal law in Mexico provides for administrative regulation of the pawnshop industry by Procuradur a Federal del Consumidor (PROFECO), Mexico s primary federal consumer protection agency. PROFECO regulates the form and terms of pawn loan contracts (but not interest or service charge rates) and defines certain operating standards and procedures for pawnshops, including retail operations, and establishes registration, disclosure, bonding and reporting requirements. There are significant fines and sanctions, including operating suspensions, for failure to comply with PROFECO s rules and regulations. 
 PROFECO requires that we report certain transactions (or series of transactions) when a customer pawns more than three items of the same category. Anti-money laundering regulations restrict the use of cash in certain transactions. Relevant aspects of the law specifically affecting the pawn industry include monthly reporting on vulnerable activities, which includes certain high-value pawn and precious metal transactions. 
 The Federal Law on the Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties requires us to protect our customers personal information. This law requires us to inform customers if we share customer personal information with third parties and to post (both online and in-store) our Data Privacy Policy.

Table of Contents 

 Our pawn business in Mexico is also subject to regulation at the state and local level through state laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances. For example, some states require permits for pawn stores to operate, certification of Team Members as trained in the valuation of merchandise and strict customer identification controls. State and local agencies often have authority to suspend store operations pending resolution of actual or alleged regulatory, licensing and permitting issues. 
 Other Regulations Our pawn business in Mexico is subject to the General Law of Administrative Responsibility GLAR ), which requires us to implement an integrity policy that contains mechanisms to ensure integrity standards throughout the organization. GLAR establishes administrative penalties for improper payments to government officials, influence peddling (including the hiring of public officials and the use of undue influence) and other corrupt acts in public procurement processes. 
 We are also subject to The Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Transactions with Funds from Illegal Sources, which requires reporting of certain transactions exceeding certain monetary limits, the appointment of a compliance officer and maintenance of customer identification records and controls. This law affects all vulnerable activities in Mexico and is intended to detect commercial activities arising from illicit or ill-gotten means through bilateral cooperation between Mexico s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit and Mexico s Attorney General s Office. The law also restricts the use of cash in certain transactions associated with high-value assets and limits and, to the extent possible, money laundering activities protected by the anonymity that such cash tra nsactions provide. Relevant aspects of the law specifically affecting the pawn industry include monthly reporting on vulnerable activities, which include pawn transactions exceedin g 174,254.85 Mexican pesos and retail transactions of precious metals exceeding 174.254.85 Mexican pesos. Retail transactions of precious metals in cash exceeding 348,509.70 Mexican pesos are prohibited. There are significant fines and sanctions for failure to comply with these rules. 
 We must also comply with the Official Mexican Standards issued by regulatory agencies in accordance with Article 40 of the Federal Law on Metrology and Standardization, which establishes rules applicable to a retail products and services and related disclosures, labeling and marketing, including NOM-179-SCFI-2016, NOM-017-SCFI-1993 and NOM-024-SCFI-2013. 
 In addition to the above, our pawn business in Mexico is subject to various general business regulations in the areas of tax compliance, customs, consumer protections, money laundering, civil protection regulations, municipal regulations, trade code (federal), public safety and employment matters, among others, by various federal, state and local governmental agencies. 
 Other Latin American Regulations 
 Local governmental entities in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras also regulate lending and retail businesses. Certain laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances require basic commercial business licenses and signage permits. Operating in these countries also subjects us to other types of regulations, including regulations related to financial reporting, data protection and privacy, tax compliance, labor and employment practices, real estate transactions, anti-money laundering, commercial and electronic banking restrictions, credit card transactions, usury law, consumer protection, marketing, advertising and other general business activities. As the scope of our international operations increases, we may face additional administrative and regulatory costs in managing our business. In addition, unexpected changes in laws and regulations, administrative interpretations of local requirements or legislation, or public remarks by elected officials could negatively affect our operations and profitability.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There are many risks and uncertainties that may affect our operations, performance, development and results. Many of these risks are beyond our control. The following is a description of the important risk factors that may affect our business. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Company Specific Risks 
 Changes in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations affecting our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. 
 Our products and services are subject to regulation under various laws and regulations in each country and jurisdiction in which we operate (see Part I, Item 1 Business Regulation ), and adverse legislation or regulations could be adopted in any such country or jurisdiction. If such legislation or regulation is adopted in any particular jurisdiction, we generally evaluate our business in the context of the new rules and determine whether we can continue to operate in that jurisdiction with new or modified products or whether it is feasible to enhance our business with additional product offerings. In any case, if we are unable to continue to operate profitably under the new rules, we may decide to close or consolidate stores, resulting in decreased revenues, earnings and assets. Further, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or orders to cease or suspend operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Negative characterizations of the pawn industry by consumer advocates, media or others could result in increased legislative or regulatory activity, could adversely affect the market value of our publicly traded stock, or could make it harder to operate our business successfully. 
 Many of the legislative and regulatory efforts that are adverse to the pawn industry are the result of negative characterization of the pawn industry by consumer advocacy groups, members of the media or others that focus on the cost of pawn loans or instances of pawn operators purchasing stolen property or accepting it as pawn collateral. We can give no assurance that there will not be further negative characterizations of our industry or that legislative or regulatory efforts to restrict the availability of pawn loans or otherwise regulate pawn operations will not be successful despite significant customer demand for such services. Such efforts, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial performance. 
 Furthermore, negative characterizations of our industry could limit the number of investors who are willing to hold our Class A Common Stock, which may adversely affect its market value; limit sources of the debt or equity financing that we need in order to conduct our operations and achieve our strategic growth objectives; or make it harder for us to attract, hire and retain talented executives and other key Team Members. 
 A significant portion of our U.S. business is concentrated in Texas and Florida. 
 As of September 30, 2024, more than 63 of our U.S. pawn stores were located in Texas (46 and Florida (17 ), and those stores account for a significant portion of our revenues and profitability. The legislative, regulatory and general business environment in Texas and Florida has been relatively favorable for our pawn business activities, but a negative legislative or regulatory change in either of those states could have a material adverse effect on our overall operations and financial performance. Further, as discussed below, areas in Texas and Florida where we have significant operations are particularly susceptible to hurricane and tropical storm activity. 
 A significant or sudden decrease in gold values or the volume of gold transactions may have a material impact on our earnings and financial position. 
 Gold jewelry comprises a large portion of the collateral security for our pawn loans and our inventory. PSC, sales proceeds and our ability to liquidate excess jewelry inventory at an acceptable margin are dependent upon gold values and the volume of gold transactions. A decline in the availability of gold or our customers willingness or ability to sell us gold or use gold as collateral for pawn loans could impact our business. The impact on our financial position and results of operations of decreases in gold values or volumes or a change in customer behavior cannot be reasonably estimated because the market and customer response to changes in gold values is not known; however, a significant decline in gold values or gold volumes could result in decreases in sales, sales margins, PLO and PSC. 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 Fluctuations in our sales, PLO, sales margins and pawn redemption rates could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. 
 We regularly experience fluctuations in a variety of operating metrics. Changes in any of these metrics, as might be caused by changes in the economic environment, competitive pressures, changes in customers tastes and preferences or a significant decrease in gold prices, could materially and adversely affect our profitability and ability to achieve our planned results of operations. 
 Achievement of our growth objectives is dependent upon our ability to open and acquire new stores. 
 Our expansion strategy includes acquiring existing stores and opening de novo store locations. Our acquisition strategy is dependent upon the availability of attractive acquisition candidates, while the success of our de novo store strategy is contingent upon numerous factors that cannot be predicted or controlled, such as the availability of acceptable locations with a desirable customer base, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, the ability to obtain required government permits and licenses and the existence of a suitable competitive environment. The achievement of our growth objectives is also subject to our ability to attract, train and retain qualified Team Members. Failure to achieve our expansion goals could adversely affect our prospects, future results of operations and future cash flows. 
 We continue to have limited indemnity obligations to AlphaCredit for pre-closing taxes. 
 Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement related to the sale of our 94 -owned subsidiary, Prestaciones Finmart, S.A.P.I. de C.V., SOFOM, E.N.R. ("Grupo Finmart") to Alpha Holding, S.A. de C.V. AlphaCredit in September 2016, we remain obligated to indemnify AlphaCredit for any pre-closing taxes (i.e., tax obligations arising from the Grupo Finmart business that are attributable to periods prior to the completion of the sale in September 2016). Those obligations continue until the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the pre-closing periods. In August 2019, AlphaCredit notified us of a potential indemnity claim for certain pre-closing taxes, but the nature, extent and validity of such claim has yet to be determined. The final payments from AlphaCredit totaling 8.0 million were placed into escrow in 2019 pending resolution of the potential indemnity claim. 
 The statute of limitations applicable to most of the pre-closing years has now expired, but AlphaCredit has informed us that they filed an amended return for 2016, which they claim extends the statute of limitations for that year. We are continuing to pursue release of the funds. 
 One person beneficially owns all of our voting stock and generally controls the outcome of all matters requiring a vote of stockholders, which may influence the value of our publicly traded non-voting stock. 
 Phillip E. Cohen is the beneficial owner of all our Class B Voting Common Stock, and all our publicly traded stock is non-voting stock. Consequently, stockholders other than Mr. Cohen have no vote with respect to the election of directors or any other matter requiring a vote of stockholders except in limited circumstances as required by law. Further, our Bylaws currently provide that the voting stockholder may appoint or remove officers or take any other action that the Board of Directors may take with respect to officers under the Bylaws. The lack of voting rights may adversely affect the market value of our publicly traded Class A Common Stock. 
 Mr. Cohen is a member of our Board of Directors and serves as Executive Chairman. As a member of the Board, Mr. Cohen is entitled to vote on all matters requiring approval of the Board. Our Bylaws currently provide that the presence of all directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and that any act of the Board of Directors requires a unanimous approval of all directors. Consequently, Mr. Cohen, as is the case with each of the other directors, has the ability to block actions of the Board. Mr. Cohen has agreed that, as a member of the Board of Directors, he will not participate in any Board vote regarding his position as Executive Chairman. 
 We have a significant firearms business in the U.S., which exposes us to increased risks of regulatory fines and penalties, lawsuits and related liabilities. 
 Some of our stores in the U.S. conduct pawn and retail transactions involving firearms, which may be associated with an increased risk of injury and related lawsuits. We may be subject to lawsuits relating to the improper use of firearms that we sell, including actions by persons attempting to recover damages from firearms retailers relating to misuse of firearms. We may also incur fines, penalties or liabilities, or have our federal firearms licenses revoked or suspended if we fail to properly perform required background checks for, and otherwise record and report, firearms transactions. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. 
 Our business is subject to Team Member and third-party robberies, burglaries and other crimes at the store level. 
 The nature of our business requires us to maintain significant cash on hand, loan collateral and inventories in our stores. Consequently, we are subject to loss of cash or merchandise as a result of robberies, burglaries, thefts, riots, looting and other criminal activity in our stores. Further, we could be subject to liability to customers or other third parties as a result of such activities. While we maintain asset protection and monitoring programs to mitigate these risks, as well as insurance programs to protect against catastrophic loss or exposure, there can be no assurance that these crimes will not occur or that such losses will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

 Changes in competition from various sources could have a material adverse impact on our ability to achieve our plans. 
 We encounter significant competition from other pawn stores, consumer lending companies, other retailers, online retailers and auction sites, many of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do. Increases in the number or size of competitors or other changes in competitive influences, such as aggressive marketing and pricing practices, could adversely affect our operations. In Mexico, we compete directly with certain pawn stores owned and operated by government affiliated or sponsored non-profit foundations, and the government could take actions that would harm our ability to compete in that market. 
 Our continued profitability and growth plans are dependent on our ability to successfully design or acquire, deploy and maintain information technology and other business systems to support our current business and our planned growth and expansion. 
 The success of our business depends on the efficiency and reliability of our information technology and business systems and related controls, including the point-of-sale system utilized in our store locations. If access to our technology infrastructure is impaired (as may occur with a computer virus, a cyber-attack or other intentional disruption by a third party, natural disaster, telecommunications system failure, electrical system failure or lost connectivity), or if there are flaws in the design or roll-out of new or refreshed technology systems (such as our point-of-sale system), we may be unable to process transactions or otherwise carry on our business in a timely and efficient manner. An infrastructure disruption could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and revenue. We consider security risks from multiple viewpoints, including physical security as well as security of infrastructure and databases. As our technology infrastructure continues to evolve from on premise to cloud service providers, we continue to assess the security of such infrastructure, including third party service providers. 
 We invested in Cash Converters International Limited for strategic reasons. Law or regulatory changes in Australia or other jurisdictions in which Cash Converters operates, or other factors, could adversely affect Cash Converters operating performance, our share of which would be reflected in our own financial statements due to the equity method of accounting. Further, if that operating performance, or other factors, adversely impact the value of Cash Converters publicly traded stock, then we may be required to impair our investment, as we have done in the past. 
 We own 43.7 of the outstanding ordinary shares of Cash Converters, which is a publicly traded company based in Australia. We made the initial investment in November 2009 and have made incremental investments periodically since then. The success of this strategic investment is dependent on a variety of factors, including Cash Converters business performance and the market s assessment of that performance. 
 In December 2022, the Australian Parliament passed the Financial Sector Reform Bill 2022, which establishes lending limits on small amount credit contracts and that bill became effective in June 2023. To reflect the expected adverse impact to its operating results, Cash Converters recorded a one-time, non-cash impairment expense during the period ended December 31, 2022 and we recorded our share of that charge during the second quarter of our fiscal 2023. 
 We have recorded a number of impairments to the carrying value of our investment in Cash Converters in the past. After an analysis of Cash Converters stock price performance and other factors, we determined the fair value of our investment in Cash Converters at September 30, 2024 was greater than its carrying value. See Note 3: Strategic Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. If the fair value of our investment declines and we determine that such decline is other-than-temporary, we may be required to further impair our investment and recognize the related investment loss, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position in the period of impairment. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of some or all of our investment in Cash Converters on favorable terms, should we decide to do so in the future. 
 Our ability to recover our investments in other companies (such as our indirect investment in Simple Management Group, Inc. and our investment in Rich Data Corporation) is heavily dependent on the success and performance of those companies, including their respective ability to obtain further debt or equity financing. 
 We have certain investments in other companies. See Note 1: Organization And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our ability to recover our investment in these companies is heavily dependent on their success and performance, potentially including their ability to obtain further debt or equity financing. To the extent that any of such companies are not successful, we may be required in future periods to impair our investment and recognize related investment losses. 
 We may incur property, casualty or other losses, including losses related to natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. Not all such losses will be covered by insurance. 
 We maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time, depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase our expenses, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

 We have significant operations located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes (notably the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions of Florida, the Gulf Coast regions of Texas including Houston, as well as Mexico and Central America). Certain areas of our operations are also susceptible to other types of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes and tornadoes. As noted above, not all physical damage that we incur as a result of any such natural disaster will be covered by insurance due to policy deductibles and risk retentions. In addition, natural disasters could have a significant negative impact on our business beyond physical damage to property, including a reduction of our PLO, inventory, pawn service charges and merchandise sales. Only limited portions, if any, of those negative impacts will be covered by applicable business interruption insurance policies. As a result, geographically isolated natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our overall operations and financial performance. 
 Goodwill comprises a significant portion of our total assets. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non-cash write-down and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions. 
 The carrying value of our goo dwill was 306.5 million, or approximately 21 of our total assets, as of September 30, 2024. We test goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for potential impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, a change in strategic direction, legal factors, operating performance indicators, a change in the competitive environment, the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units. 
 When performing our annual test of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine an impairment is more-likely-than-not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform a qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to a quantitative impairment test. When performing a quantitative impairment test, we apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
 When we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital WACC determined separately for each reporting unit. The determination of fair value involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated WACC derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical to us from an operational and economic standpoint. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. 
 See Note 1: Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6: Goodwill and Intangible Assets of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of our annual impairment tests performed for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 The conversion feature of our convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 We have a total of 333.4 million of converti ble notes outstanding as of September 30, 2024. See Note 7: Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. If the conversion feature of any of those convertible notes is triggered, holders will be entitled to convert the notes at their option at any time during specified periods. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we may be required, or may choose, to settle the obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. 
 Conversion of our convertible notes into stock may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our Class A Common Stock. 
 If it were to occur, the conversion of convertible notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of Class A Common Stock upon conversion. Any sales in the public market of such shares could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our Class A Common Stock could depress the price of our Class A Common Stock.

 We have a limited number of unreserved shares available for future issuance, which may limit our ability to conduct future financings and other transactions and our ability to offer equity awards to management. 
 Our certificate of incorporation currently authorizes us to issue up to 100 million shares of Class A Common Stock. Taking into consideration the shares that are issued and outstanding, as well as the shares that have been reserved for issuance pursuant to convertible notes, outstanding equity incentive compensation awards and the conversion of the Class B Common Stock, we had approximately 7.7 million shar es of authorized Class A Common Stock available for other uses as of September 30, 2024 . We expect that number will be reduced to 7.0 million fol lowing the issuance of currently approved Long-Term Incentive awards in November 2024 . There fore, our ability to issue shares of Class A Common Stock (other than pursuant to the existing reserved-for commitments), or securities or instruments that are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Class A Common Stock, may be limited until such time additional authorized, unissued and unreserved shares become available or unless we determine we are unlikely to issue all of the shares that are currently reserved. During this time, for example, our ability to complete equity or equity-linked financings or other transactions (including strategic acquisitions) that involve the issuance or potential issuance of Class A Common Stock may be limited. Further, our ability to offer equity-based compensation to our management team may also be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to align management s incentives with stockholders or attract and retain key management personnel. 
 General Risks 
 Public health issues could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 Our business may be impacted by public health issues, such as COVID-19, other pandemics and the spread of contagious diseases. Such public health issues, and the government and consumer responses thereto, may (i) limit our ability to supply products and services to our customers as a result of store closures, reduced access to or foot traffic in our stores, or labor shortages, (ii) adversely affect the demand for our products and services or (iii) cause other unforeseen negative developments. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 We have significant operations in Latin America, and changes in the business, regulatory, political or social climate could impact our operations there, which could adversely affect our results of operations and growth plans. 
 We own and operate a significant number of pawn stores in Latin America (primarily Mexico, but also Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras). Further, our growth plans include potential expansion in some of those countries as well as potentially other countries in Latin America. Doing business in those countries exposes us to risks related to political instability, corruption, economic volatility, drug cartel and gang-related violence, social unrest including riots and looting, tax and foreign investment policies, public safety and security concerns and uncertain application of laws and regulations. Consequently, actions or events in any of those countries that are beyond our control could restrict our ability to operate there or otherwise adversely affect the profitability of those operations. Furthermore, changes in the business, regulatory or political climate in any of those countries, or significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, could affect our ability to expand or continue our operations there, which could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, results of operations and cash flows. For a description of the current regulatory environment in the Latin American countries in which we operate, see Mexico Regulations and Other Latin America Regulations under Part I, Item 1 Business Regulation. 
 A significant change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial position. 
 We have foreign operations in Latin America (primarily Mexico, but also Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras) and an equity investment in Australia. Our assets and investments in, and earnings and dividends from each of these countries must be translated to U.S. dollars from their respective functional currencies. A significant weakening of any of these foreign currencies could result in lower assets and earnings in U.S. dollars, resulting in a potentially material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Litigation and regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 We are currently subject to various litigation and regulatory actions, and additional actions could arise in the future. Potential actions range from claims and assertions arising in the ordinary course of business (such as contract, customer or employment disputes) to more significant corporate-level matters or shareholder litigation. All of these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur, which could include monetary damages, fines and penalties or other relief. Any unfavorable ruling or outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or could negatively affect our reputation.

 Under our certificate of incorporation, we are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers for costs and liabilities they incur in their capacity as directors or officers of the Company. Consequently, if a proceeding names or involves any of our directors or officers, then (subject to certain exceptions) we are generally obligated to pay or reimburse the cost or liability such director or officer incurs as a result of such proceeding (including defense costs, judgments and amounts paid in settlement). We maintain management liability insurance that protects us from much of this potential indemnification exposure, as well as potential costs or liabilities that may be directly incurred by the Company in some cases. However, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and there may be elements of the costs or liabilities that are not covered under the insurance policies. In addition, to the extent our ultimate liability in any such proceeding (or any combination of proceedings that are included in the same policy year) exceeds the management liability policy limits, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Our acquisitions, investments and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. 
 In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, investments and other transactions. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including risks that we may not realize the expected return on an acquisition or investment, that we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired business, or that we may experience difficulty in integrating acquired businesses into our business systems and processes. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, investments or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to inability to obtain required regulatory or other approvals or other factors. Furthermore, acquisitions, investments and other transactions require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business, and there are inherent risks in integrating and operating any acquired business. These factors could harm our business and results of operations. 
 We may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and other general business laws and regulations, and any determination that we violated these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We are subject to various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the U.S. and the General Law of Administrative Responsibility in Mexico. We are also subject to various laws and regulations designed to prevent money laundering or the financial support of terrorism or other illegal activity, including the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act in the U.S. and The Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Transactions with Funds From Illegal Sources in Mexico. See Part I, Item 1 Business Regulation. Further, our business is expanding in countries and regions that are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business and political environments. 
 While we maintain controls and policies to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, these controls and policies may prove to be less than effective. If Team Members, agents or other persons for whose conduct we are held responsible violate our policies, we may be subject to severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, and we may be subject to other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Changes in our liquidity and capital requirements or in access to capital markets or other financing and transactional banking sources could limit our ability to achieve our plans. 
 A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of debt or equity financing could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results. Our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, including the possible refinancing of existing indebtedness, will depend upon market conditions, our financial condition and the willingness of financing sources to make capital available to us at acceptable rates and terms. The inability to access capital at acceptable rates and terms could restrict or limit our ability to achieve our growth objectives, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our access to transactional banking services, as well as international wire services between certain countries, is an ongoing business requirement. Inability in accessing or maintaining transactional banking or wire services could lead to increased costs or the inability to efficiently manage our cash as we would be required to seek alternative banking services or obtain services from several regional or local retail banks.

 We collect and store a variety of sensitive customer information, and breaches in data security or other cyber-attacks could harm our business operations and lead to reputational damage. 
 In the course of conducting our business, we collect and store on our information technology systems a variety of information about our customers, including sensitive personal identifying and financial information. We may not have the resources or technical expertise to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our service providers, our customers or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increased costs, including costs to hire additional personnel, purchase additional protection technologies, train Team Members and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the technology we use to protect data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. We could be subject to fines, penalties and liabilities if any such information is misappropriated from our systems or we otherwise fail to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information. Further, any such data security breach could cause damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our data security measures, which could adversely affect our business and prospects. 
 We may face business interruptions or other adverse effects on our operations and growth. 
 Our business and operations could be subject to interruption or damage due to inclement weather, natural disaster, power loss, acts of violence, terrorist attacks, war, civil unrest or similar events. Further, we may experience information technology or other business systems disruptions. Such events could impair our customers' access to our business, impact our ability to expand or continue our operations or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 We face other risks discussed under Part II, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 
 ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 
 Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy 
 We face various cybersecurity risks, including those related to unauthorized access to and misuse of data, system interruptions, ransomware, malicious software and other threats. Our cybersecurity program incorporates information technology, retail technology and customer products designed to mitigate cyber risks. Our security measures are customized to meet our unique business requirements and encompass firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, encryption and multi-factor authentication. We also engage external experts to enhance and assess our cybersecurity measures in the form of maturity assessments, incident response, penetration testing and other advisory services. We adhere to the practices and standards outlined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework. 
 We employ continual monitoring of our systems and data, managed by an external detection and response firm. In the event of a cyber incident, we maintain an incident response plan coordinated across multiple departments. This strategy is designed for rapid and effective incident management to minimize operational disruption. Our response protocol includes steps for detection, containment, eradication, recovery and post-incident review, including impact on safety, data loss, operational disruption, cost and potential reputational damage. 
 Recognizing our employees as a vital defense mechanism, we provide cybersecurity, privacy and information-handling training. Additionally, we conduct regular phishing exercises to enhance employee vigilance. Our educational programs aim to raise awareness about cyber risks and teach employees to safeguard the Company, our customers and themselves against cyber threats. These programs inform our workforce about the latest cybersecurity dangers and safe online practices, including secure access, phishing awareness, remote work security and reporting suspicious activities. 
 Cybersecurity Governance and Oversight 
 Our cybersecurity governance framework is structured to promote accountability and ongoing enhancement of cybersecurity measures. Management of the cybersecurity program involves cross-functional resources, our Cyber and Technology Risk Committee, an internal multi-departmental committee formed to address cyber and data privacy matters. The cybersecurity program is led by our Chief Information Security Officer CISO who reports to the Chief Legal Officer. The Internal Audit Department monitors and reviews our cybersecurity initiatives. 
 The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing and monitoring the material risks facing the Company. The Audit and Risk Committee of the Board is charged with overseeing our risk management framework, including cybersecurity risks. The CISO reports directly to the Audit and Risk Committee on cybersecurity risks on a quarterly basis.

Table of Contents 

 To date, we have not identified any cybersecurity threats or incidents that have had or are likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, the escalation of cybersecurity threats poses a risk to our systems, networks and products and services, which, despite our efforts to mitigate these risks, may not protect against all incidents. For a detailed discussion on how cybersecurity risks could materially impact our business, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. 
 
 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 We lease our pawn store locations, which are located throughout our geographic areas of operations. See Part I, Item 1 Business Segment and Geographic Information. Our pawn stores are typically located in a freestanding building or occupy all or part of a retail strip center with contiguous parking. A portion of the store interior is designed for retail operations, with merchandise displayed for sale by category. Distinctive exterior design and attractive in-store signage provide an appealing atmosphere to customers. W e maintain or reimburse our landlords for maintaining property and general liability insurance for each of our stores. Our stores are open six or seven days a w eek. 
 Leases for our U.S. locations generally have initial terms ranging from three to ten years and typically allow for renewals in increments of three-to-five years. Our primary corporate office is located in Austin, Texas and is leased through March 2029 with escalating rent payments annually and includes two five-year extension options at the end of the lease term. Our locations in Latin America are generally leased on three-to-five year terms. 
 Our existing leases expire on various dates through fiscal 2039, with a small number of leases on month-to-month terms. All leases provide for specified periodic rental payments at market rates. Most leases require us to maintain the property and pay the cost of insurance and taxes. We believe the termination of any one of our leases would not have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our strategy generally is to lease rather than own space for our stores. On an ongoing basis, we may close or consolidate under-performing store locations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 1,279 stores, 542 of which are located in the U.S., with 46 located in Texas, 17 in Florida and the remainder spread across 17 other states. We also have 565 locations in Mexico, 133 in Guatemala, 18 in El Salvador and 21 in Honduras. 
 In addition to our store leases, we lease approximately 108,000 square feet of corporate office space in Austin, Texas (70,742 square feet of which is being subleased or made available for sublease to other tenants). We lease other corporate office space in Mexico (8,600 square feet), Guatemala (3,500 square feet), El Salvador (4,500 square feet) and Honduras (1,200 square feet).

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of EZCORP, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, we, us , our or the Company for the two-year period ended September 30, 2024. The following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Risks and Uncertainties That May Affect Future Results below. 
 Business Development 
 On September 11, 2024, the Company announced entry into an acquisition agreement with Presta Dinero, S.A. de C.V. for the purchase of 53 pawn stores in Mexico. While at the time we expected to complete the transaction by October 31, 2024, the transaction has not yet closed and the parties remain in discussion. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide certain other non-GAAP financial information on a constant currency basis constant currency and same store basis. We use constant currency results to evaluate our Latin America Pawn operations, which are denominated primarily in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and other Latin American currencies. We analyze results on a same store basis (which is defined as stores open during the entirety of the comparable periods) to better understand existing store performance without the influence of increases or decreases resulting solely from changes in store count. We believe presentation of constant currency and same store results is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our Latin America Pawn operations (in the case of constant currency) and our store operations (in the case of same store results) and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a better understanding and evaluation of factors and trends affecting our business. We provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of our GAAP consolidated financial statements. We use this non-GAAP financial information to evaluate and compare operating results across accounting periods. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not rather than or superior to, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. 
 Constant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations items denominated in local currency to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We used the end-of-period rate for balance sheet items and the average closing daily exchange rate on a monthly basis during the appropriate period for statement of operations items. Our statement of operations constant currency results reflect the monthly exchange rate fluctuations and are not directly calculable from the rates below. Constant currency results, where presented, also exclude the foreign currency gain or loss. The end-of-period and approximate average exchange rates for each applicable currency as compared to U.S. dollars as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: September 30, Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Mexican peso 19.7 17.4 17.7 18.3 Guatemalan quetzal 7.6 7.7 7.6 7.6 Honduran lempira 24.6 24.5 24.4 24.3 Australian dollar 1.4 1.6 1.5 1.5

 Pawn loans outstanding PLO increased 28.3 million (12 to 274.1 million due to improved operational performance and continued strong pawn demand. 
 Total revenues increased 112.6 million (11 and gross profit increased 12 , reflecting improved pawn service charge PSC revenue, merchandise sales and merchandise sales gross profit. 
 PSC increased 52.8 million (14 as a result of higher average PLO. Merchandise sales increased 48.3 million (8 ). Merchandise sales gross margin remains within our targeted range at 36 . 
 Operating expenses increased 52.1 million (10 primarily due to (a) a 42.5 million increase in store expenses as a result of increased labor driven by inflationary and minimum wage increases and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to rent and (b) a 8.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses, primarily due to labor, incentive compensation and to a lesser extent, cost related to the implementation and ongoing support for our Workday ERP system. 
 Total non-operating income increased 43.6 million (108 ), primarily due to recognition in the prior year of our share of losses in Cash Converters net results related to their non-cash goodwill impairment charge, a reduction of interest expense and an increase in interest income. Interest expense decreased 2.9 million, primarily driven by the prior year net loss recorded on the partial extinguishments of the 2024 convertible notes and 2025 convertible notes. See Note 7: Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for further discussion. The interest income increase is primarily due to our treasury management with increased market interest rates. 
 Income tax expense increased 19.3 million, primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes of 64.0 million, an increase in non-deductible expense in Latin America and accrued withholding taxes on prior earnings that are no longer permanently reinvested. Income tax expense includes other items that do not necessarily correspond to pre-tax earnings and create volatility in our effective tax rate. These items include the net effect of state taxes, non-deductible items and changes in valuation allowances for certain foreign operations. See Note 9: Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for quantification of these items.

 Segment contribution increased 60.3 million or 40 , primarily due to the improved operating results of the segments, as discussed above. 
 General and administrative expenses increased 8.0 million (12 ), primarily due to labor, incentive compensation and, to a lesser extent, costs related to the implementation and ongoing support of our Workday ERP system. 
 Interest expense decreased 2.9 million (17 ), primarily driven by the prior year net loss recorded on the partial extinguishments of the 2024 convertible notes and 2025 convertible notes. See Note 7: Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for further discussion. 
 Interest income increased 1.7 million, due primarily to our treasury management with increased market interest rates. 
 Income tax expense increased 19.3 million primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes of 64.0 million, an increase in non-deductible expense in Latin America and accrued withholding taxes on prior earnings that are no longer permanently reinvested. Income tax expense includes other items that do not necessarily correspond to pre-tax earnings and create volatility in our effective tax rate. These items include the net effect of state taxes, non-deductible items and changes in valuation allowances for certain foreign operations. See Note 9: Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for quantification of these items.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Our cash and equivalents balance was 170.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 220.6 million at September 30, 2023. Our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. 
 Cash Flows 
 The table and discussion below present a summary of the sources and uses of our cash: Fiscal Year Ended September 30, Change (in thousands) 2024 2023 Cash flows provided by operating activities 
 113,600 101,834 12 Cash flows used in investing activities (111,853) (110,886) 1 Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities (50,183) 23,692 (312) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (725) (41) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (49,161) 14,599 (437) Represents a percentage computation that is not mathematically meaningful. 
 The 11.8 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income (when considering adjustments for non-cash items affecting net income) as well as changes in working capital primarily related to the timing of payments of income taxes, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and inventory. 
 The 1.0 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase of 51.7 million in net pawn lending outflows, offset by a 27.0 million increase in cash inflows from the sale of forfeited collateral and a 23.7 million net decrease in cash flows used to fund strategic investments, capital expenditures and acquisitions. 
 The 73.9 million increase in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily related to the December 2022 financing of the 2029 Convertible Notes, in which we issued 230.0 million principal amount of 3.750 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029 offset by the extinguishment of approximately 109.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Convertible Notes for approximately 117.5 million plus accrued interest and approximately 69.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Convertible Notes for approximately 62.9 million plus accrued interest. In addition, we used approximately 5.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes offering to repurchase 578,703 shares of our Class A common stock from purchasers of the notes in privately negotiated transactions. Further, on July 1, 2024, the 2024 Convertible Notes matured and the remaining 34.4 million aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest was repaid using cash on hand. During 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 1,218,503 shares of our Class A Common Stock for 12.0 million under the Common Stock Repurchase Program. 
 The net effect of these changes was a 49.2 million decrease in cash on hand during the current year, resulting in a 179.8 million ending cash and restricted cash balance. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 In December 2022, we issued 230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Convertible Notes. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2029 Convertible Notes, we extinguished approximately 109.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Convertible Notes for approximately 117.5 million plus accrued interest and approximately 69.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Convertible Notes for approximately 62.9 million plus accrued interest. In addition, we used approximately 5.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes offering to repurchase 578,703 shares of our Class A common stock from purchasers of the notes in privately negotiated transactions. See Note 7: Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The shares repurchased in conjunction with the transactions discussed above were authorized separately from, and not considered part of, the publicly announced share repurchase program referred to below. 
 On May 3, 2022, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million of our Class A Common Stock over three years. As of September 30, 2024, we have repurchased 2,845,548 shares of our Class A Common Stock under the program for 26.0 million which amount was allocated between Additional paid-in capital and Retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Execution of the program will be responsive to fluctuating market conditions and valuations, liquidity needs and the expected return on investment compared to other opportunities.

Table of Contents 

 Under the stock repurchase program, we may purchase Class A Non-Voting common stock from time to time at management s discretion in accordance with applicable securities laws, including through open market transactions, block or privately negotiated transactions, or any combination thereof. In addition, we may purchase shares pursuant to a trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 The amount and timing of purchases will be dependent on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, general market conditions, legal and regulatory requirements, general business conditions, the level of cash flows and corporate considerations determined by management and the Board, such as liquidity and capital needs and the availability of attractive alternative investment opportunities. The Board has reserved the right to modify, suspend or terminate the program at any time. 
 On July 1, 2024, the 2024 Convertible Notes matured and the remaining 34.4 million aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest was repaid using cash on hand. 
 We anticipate that cash flows from operations and cash on hand will be adequate to fund ongoing operations, debt service requirements, tax payments, any future stock repurchases, strategic investments, our contractual obligations, planned de novo store growth, capital expenditures and working capital requirements through fiscal 2025. We continue to explore acquisition opportunities, both large and small, and may choose to pursue additional debt, equity or equity-linked financings in the future should the need arise. Depending on the level of acquisition activity and other factors, our ability to repay our longer term debt obligations, including the convertible debt maturing in May 2025 and December 2029, may require us to refinance these obligations through the issuance of new debt securities, equity securities, convertible securities or through new credit facilities. 
 Convertible Notes 
 For a description of the terms of our convertible notes, including the associated conversion and other related features and transactions, see Note 7: Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Below is a summary of our cash needs to meet future aggregate contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024: 
 Payments due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Debt obligations (a) 333,373 103,373 230,000 Interest on long-term debt obligations 46,713 10,057 17,250 17,250 2,156 Lease obligations (b) 293,380 76,639 118,792 59,939 38,010 Total (c) (d) 673,466 190,069 136,042 77,189 270,166 
 (a) Excludes debt discount and deferred financing costs as well as convertible features. 
 (b) Excludes 5.6 million in sublease payments expected to be received. 
 (c) No provision for uncertain tax benefits has been reflected in the contractual obligations table as the timing of any such payment is uncertain. See Note 9: Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Additionally, no provision for insurance reserves, deferred compensation arrangements, or other liabilities totaling 8.5 million has been included as the timing of such payments are uncertain. 
 (d) Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities, except for current maturities of long-term debt, which are included in the debt obligations caption above and accrued portions of interest and lease obligations, which are included in the interest on long-term debt obligations and lease obligations captions above. 
 In addition to the lease obligations in the table above, we are responsible for the maintenance, property taxes and insurance at most of our locations. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, these collectively amounted to 17.7 million. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition, inventory, loan loss allowances, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived and other intangible assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience, observable trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We use this information to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 The critical accounting policies and estimates that could have a significant impact on our results of operations, as well as relevant recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1: Organization And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Certain accounting policies regarding the quantification of the sensitivity of certain critical estimates are discussed further below. 
 Pawn Loan Revenue Recognition 
 We record PSC using the effective interest method over the life of the loan for all pawn loans we believe to be collectible. We base our estimate of collectible loans on several inputs, including recent redemption rates, historical trends in redemption rates and the amount of loans due in the following months. Unexpected variations in any of these factors could change our estimate of collectible loans, affecting our earnings and financial condition. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of our PSC receivable was 44.0 million. Assuming the average forfeiture rate increased or decreased by 10 , our pawn service charges receivable balance as of September 30, 2024 would have increased or decreased by approximately 1.4 million. 
 Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold 
 We consider our estimates of obsolete or slow-moving inventory and shrinkage in determining the appropriate overall valuation allowance for inventory. We monitor our sales margins for each type of inventory on an ongoing basis and compare to historical margins. Significant variances in those margins may require a revision to future inventory reserve estimates. We have historically revised our reserve pertaining to jewelry inventory depending on the current price of gold and resulting trends in margins. Future declines in gold prices may cause an increase in reserve rates pertaining to jewelry inventory. As of September 30, 2024, the gross balance of our inventory was 194.7 million, for which we have included reserves of 2.7 million. Assuming the reserve rates were increased or decreased by 10 , our inventory reserve balance as of September 30, 2024 would have increased or decreased by approximately 0.3 million. 
 Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine an impairment is more-likely-than-not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform a qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to a quantitative impairment test. When performing a quantitative impairment test, we apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
 When we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital WACC determined separately for each reporting unit. The determination of fair value involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated WACC derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical to us from an operational and economic standpoint. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. 
 We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we believe as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. 
 We consider the assessment of the occurrence of triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that may indicate the fair value of goodwill may be impaired to be a critical estimate. Furthermore, we consider the assumptions discussed above pertaining to the income approach we use in the quantitative testing of impairment to be critical estimates. 
 The results of the impairment analyses for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 are discussed in Note 6: Goodwill And Intangible Assets of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Income Taxes 
 Management believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the net recorded deferred tax assets. In the event we determine all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. We have included valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits not expected to be utilized based on specific facts and estimates for each jurisdiction.

Table of Contents 

 We consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes of our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S. 
 We may be subject to income tax audits by the respective tax authorities in any or all of the jurisdictions in which we operate or have operated within a relevant period. Significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions. We utilize the required two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of an audit or the refinement of an estimate. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We believe adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Risk Disclosures 
 We are exposed to market risk related primarily to gold values and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Our earnings and financial position are affected by changes in gold values and, to a lesser extent, silver and precious stone values and the resulting impact on pawn lending, jewelry sales and jewelry cost of goods sold. The proceeds of scrap sales and our ability to sell jewelry inventory at an acceptable margin depend on gold values. The impact on our financial position and results of operations of a hypothetical change in gold values cannot be reasonably estimated due to the timing of scrap sales, among other operational considerations. 
 Our earnings and financial position are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our equity investments and our operations outside the U.S. While we generally do not seek to hedge amounts in foreign currencies, we consider hedging strategies from time to time to mitigate certain discrete risks of exposure via short term arrangements. 
 The translation adjustment from Cash Converters through June 30, 2024 (included in our September 30, 2024 results on a three-month lag) was a nominal increase to stockholders equity, excluding income tax impacts. As of September 30, 2024, 1.00 Australian dollar strengthened at 0.6944 U.S. as compared to 0.6452 in the prior year. 
 The translation adjustment from Latin America primarily representing the change of the Mexican peso during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 was a 20.5 million decrease to stockholders equity. As of September 30, 2024, the Mexican peso weakened approximately 11 to 1.00 Mexican to 0.0508 U.S. from 0.0574 U.S. as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Guatemalan quetzal strengthened approximately 2 Q1.00 Guatemalan to 0.1325 U.S. from 0.1302 U.S. as of September 30, 2023. We have currently assumed indefinite reinvestment of earnings and capital in Latin America in excess of the 20.0 million of prior earnings for which applicable withholding taxes have been accrued as of September 30, 2024. Accumulated translation gains or losses related to any future repatriation of earnings or capital would impact our earnings in the period of repatriation. 
 To a lesser degree, our operations are affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Honduran lempira.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 EZCORP, Inc. 
 Rollingwood, Texas 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EZCORP, Inc. (the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated November 13, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Revenue Recognition for United States (U.S.) and Mexico Merchandise Sales and Pawn Service Charges 
 As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue for merchandise sales at the point in time when merchandise inventory is sold and delivered to the customer. The Company recognizes revenue for pawn service charges using the effective interest method over the life of the pawn loans for all pawn loans the Company believes to be collectible. As described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, for the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company s total revenues within the U.S. and Mexico were 836.1 million and 247.6 million, respectively, substantially all of which related to merchandise sales and pawn service charges. 
 We identified revenue recognition for merchandise sales and pawn service charges within the U.S. and Mexico as a critical audit matter, as auditing merchandise sales and pawn service charges revenue within these locations required a higher extent of audit effort. 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 Testing the effectiveness of automated application controls over the initiation, processing and recording of revenue for merchandise sales and pawn service charges within the U.S. and Mexico.

Similarly, during the third quarter of our fiscal year, we record our percentage interest in the results of Cash Converters for the three months ended June 30 using the estimated results of Cash Converters for the three months ended March 31 of that year. Cash Converters files semi-annual financial reports with the Australian Securities Investments Commission and the Australian Stock Exchange as of and for the periods ended June 30 and December 31.

 In evaluating whether our cloud computing arrangements include a software license, we consider whether we have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether it is feasible for us to either run the software on our own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, we account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, we account for the arrangement as a service contract. For cloud computing arrangements that meet the definition of a service contract, the Company capitalizes implementation costs incurred during the application development stage and until the software is ready for its intended use within Other assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and then amortizes the costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. The hosting service fees are not considered an implementation cost and are treated as a prepaid expense and then the Company amortizes the costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

 Based primarily on the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalents, pawn loans, pawn service charges receivable and other liabilities, we estimate that their carrying value approximates fair value. We consider our cash and cash equivalents to be measured using Level 1 inputs and our pawn loans, pawn service charges receivable and other liabilities to be measured using Level 3 inputs. Significant increases or decreases in the underlying assumptions used to value pawn loans, pawn service charges receivable, consumer loans, fees and interest receivable and other debt could significantly increase or decrease these fair value estimates. 
 In fiscal 2023, we loaned million to Founders in exchange for a Demand Promissory Note secured by the common interest in Founders held by the other member. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the note was per annum, and all principal and accrued interest is due on demand. Based primarily on the short-term nature of the note, we estimate that its carrying value approximates fair value as of September 30, 2024. 
 We use the equity method of accounting to account for our ownership interest in Cash Converters. The inputs used to generate the fair value of the investment in Cash Converters were considered Level 1 inputs. These inputs consist of (a) the quoted stock price on the Australian Stock Exchange multiplied by (b) the number of shares we owned multiplied by (c) the applicable foreign currency exchange rate as of the end of our reporting period. We included no control premium for owning a large percentage of outstanding shares. 
 We measured the fair value of the 2024, 2025 and 2029 Convertible Notes using quoted price inputs. The notes are not actively traded, and thus the price inputs represent a Level 2 measurement. As the quoted price inputs are highly variable from day to day, the fair value estimates disclosed above could significantly increase or decrease. 
 In fiscal 2019, we received million in previously escrowed seller funds as a result of settling certain indemnification claims with the seller of GPMX. In April 2019, we loaned the million back to the seller of GPMX in exchange for a promissory note. The interest rate on the note was per annum and was secured by certain marketable securities owned by the seller and held in a U.S. brokerage account. All principal and accrued interest on the promissory note was received in April 2024.

 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029 
 In December 2022, we issued million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029 (the 2029 Convertible Notes ), for which million remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The 2029 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated December 12, 2022 (the 2022 Indenture by and between the Company and Truist Bank, as trustee. The 2029 Convertible Notes were issued in a private offering under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 2029 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears at a rate of per annum on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2023, and mature on December 15, 2029 (the 2029 Maturity Date ), unless converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with the terms prior to such date. At maturity, the holders of the 2029 Convertible Notes will be entitled to receive cash equal to the principal of the 2029 Convertible Notes plus accrued interest. 
 The effective interest rate for fiscal 2024 was approximately . As of September 30, 2024, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs will be amortized using the effective interest method through the 2029 Maturity Date assuming no early conversion. 
 The 2029 Convertible Notes are convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 89.0313 shares of Class A Common Stock per 1,000 principal amount (equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share). The conversion rate will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.

On or after June 15, 2029 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the 2029 Maturity Date, holders of 2029 Convertible Notes may, at their option, convert their 2029 Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. 
 We may not redeem the 2029 Convertible Notes prior to December 21, 2026. At our option, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2029 Convertible Notes on or after December 21, 2026, if the last reported sale price of the Class A Common Stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to of the principal amount of the 2029 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 2029 Convertible Notes were not convertible as no conditions of conversion had been met. Accordingly, the net balance of the 2029 Convertible Notes was classified as a non-current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. The classification of the 2029 Convertible Notes as current or non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is evaluated at each balance sheet date and may change from time to time depending on whether any of the conversion conditions has been met. 
 If one of the conversion conditions is met in any future fiscal quarter, we will classify our net liability under the 2029 Convertible Notes as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the end of that fiscal quarter. If none of the conversion conditions have been met in a future fiscal quarter prior to the one-year period immediately preceding the 2029 Maturity Date, we will classify our net liability under the 2029 Convertible Notes as a non-current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the end of that fiscal quarter. If the note holders elect to convert their 2029 Convertible Notes prior to maturity, any unamortized debt issuance costs will be recognized as expense at the time of conversion. If the entire outstanding principal amount had been converted on September 30, 2024, we would have recorded an expense associated with the conversion, comprised of million of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of September 30, 2024, none of the note holders had elected to convert their 2029 Convertible Notes. 
 The stock trading price condition and other triggers are measured on a quarter-by-quarter basis and were not met as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the if-converted value of the 2029 Convertible Notes did not exceed the principal amount. 
 Note Repurchases 
 In December 2022, we repurchased approximately million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2024 for approximately million plus accrued interest and approximately million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 for approximately million plus accrued interest and recognized a million loss on extinguishment of debt recorded to Interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 
 In May 2018, we issued million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 (the 2025 Convertible Notes ), for which million remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated May 14, 2018 (the 2018 Indenture by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the original trustee. Effective October 1, 2019, Truist (formerly BB T) assumed the duties and responsibilities as trustee under the 2018 Indenture. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued in a private offering under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933.

 The effective interest rate for fiscal 2024 was approximately for the 2025 Convertible Notes. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs will be amortized using the effective interest method through the 2025 Maturity Date assuming no early conversion.

 Prior to November 1, 2024, the 2025 Convertible Notes were convertible at the option of the holders only upon certain conditions, none of which were met. On or after November 1, 2024 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the 2025 Maturity Date, holders of 2025 Convertible Notes may, at their option, convert their 2025 Convertible Notes at any time. Conversions occurring on or after November 1, 2024, are settled in a combination of cash and shares of Class A Common Stock, unless, by November 1, 2024, we elect another settlement method. Pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Indenture, we have elected to settle any conversions of the 2025 Convertible Notes using shares of Class A Common Stock (physical settlement). On October 28, 2024, we provided notice of that election to the trustee. 
 Given the 2025 Maturity Date of May 1, 2025, the net balance of the 2025 Convertible Notes was classified as a current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. If the note holders elect to convert their 2025 Convertible Notes prior to maturity, any unamortized debt issuance costs will be recognized as expense at the time of conversion. If the entire outstanding principal amount had been converted on September 30, 2024, we would have recorded an expense associated with the conversion, comprised of million of unamortized debt issuance costs.

 million of our Class A Common Stock over (the Common Stock Repurchase Program ). Execution of the program will be responsive to fluctuating market conditions and valuations, liquidity needs and the expected return on investment compared to other opportunities. 
 The amount and timing of purchases will be dependent on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, general market conditions, legal and regulatory requirements, general business conditions, the level of cash flows and corporate considerations determined by management and the Board, such as liquidity and capital needs and the availability of attractive alternative investment opportunities.

Such transactions were authorized separately from, and not considered a part of, the publicly announced Common Stock Repurchase Program discussed above. The repurchase amount is allocated between Additional paid-in capital and Retained earnings in our consolidated balance sheets.

At any time, the number of shares that are available for issuance under future awards Available Shares is equal to the number of Authorized Shares reduced by the number of shares previously issued and the number of shares that may be issued under outstanding awards. The number of Available Shares is increased for shares covered by awards that are forfeited, cancelled or otherwise terminated without the issuance of shares or shares that are withheld at the request of a participant to satisfy such participant s tax withholding obligations. 
 The 2022 LTI Plan is administered by the People and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee ).

 Under the 2010 LTI Plan, we granted awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. Awards granted to employees were typically subject to performance and service conditions. Awards granted to non-employee directors were time-based awards subject only to service conditions. Awards were measured at the grant date fair value with compensation costs associated with the awards recognized over the requisite service period, usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million, which begin to expire in 2025 if not utilized. We also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million, which will begin to expire in 2030 if not utilized. Additionally, we have a million foreign tax credit that will expire between 2025 to 2026 if not utilized. 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated tax impact of temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. The Company has elected to account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost and therefore has not recorded deferred taxes related to GILTI on its foreign subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, tax in amount of million has been accrued for estimated tax on GILTI that will be due. A valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our valuation allowance has been established to offset certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be utilized prior to expiration. The valuation allowance decreased by million in fiscal 2024, primarily due to the release of valuation allowance associated with net operating losses no longer available for use. We believe our results from future operations will generate sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions such that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized. 
 Deferred taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately million which are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. Accordingly, no provision for foreign withholding taxes associated with a distribution of those earnings has been made. We estimate that, upon distribution of our share of these earnings, we would be subject to withholding taxes of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. We provided deferred income taxes on all undistributed earnings from Cash Converters. After extensive search for multi-store acquisitions in Guatemala, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we altered our Guatemala growth strategy to a focus on organic growth of existing stores, denovos and potentially small acquisitions. As a result, we provided for applicable foreign withholding taxes on million of undistributed foreign earnings and recorded a liability of million.

 The lease includes extension options at the end of the initial lease term. The estimated minimum future rental payments under the lease are approximately million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we have subleases in place for a portion of our corporate operating office lease for estimated minimum future sublease payments of approximately million. 
 In fiscal 2023, we assessed the recoverability of the right-of-use asset for our corporate office, primarily due to the termination of a significant sublease. We determined the undiscounted cash flows of the relative corporate lease and sublease did not exceed the net book value of the right-of-use asset. We then determined the fair value of the corporate lease and sublease did not exceed the book value of the right-of-use asset, and an impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal 2023 to Impairment of other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024.

 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, (c) provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorization of management and the Board of Directors and (d) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing below.

 Inherent Limitations on Internal Controls 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. Limitations inherent in any control system include the following: 
 Judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and control and process breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. 
 Controls can be circumvented by individuals, acting alone or in collusion with others, or by management override. 
 The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. 
 The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resources are constrained, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 
 Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

 Director nominations must be selected, or recommended for the board s selection, by either (1) a majority of the independent directors or (2) a nominations committee comprised solely of independent directors (Rule 5605(e)). 
 Rule 5615(c)(2), however, provides that a Controlled Company is exempt from the requirement to have a majority of independent directors and from the requirements to have independent director oversight over executive compensation and director nominations. The Listing Rules define a Controlled Company as a company of which more than 50 of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company. EZCORP is a Controlled Company within this meaning by virtue of the fact that 100 of the outstanding Class B Voting Common Stock (the only class of voting securities outstanding) is held of record solely by MS Pawn Limited Partnership and beneficially by Phillip E. Cohen. 
 The Company has relied on the Controlled Company exemptions in the past, but is not currently relying on such exemptions. The controlling shareholder or the Board may implement changes in the future that would again require the Company to rely on the Controlled Company exemptions under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. 
 Committees of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors maintains the following committees to assist it in its oversight responsibilities. The current membership of each committee is indicated in the list of directors set forth under Board of Directors above.

 ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 
 Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
 This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes our compensation practices and the executive compensation policies, decisions and actions of the People and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the Committee ). It focuses specifically on compensation earned during fiscal 2024 by the following individuals, referred to as our Named Executive Officers. 
 Name Position Lachlan P. Given Chief Executive Officer Timothy K. Jugmans Chief Financial Officer Philip E. Cohen Executive Chairman John Blair Powell, Jr. Chief Operating Officer Lisa VanRoekel 
 Chief Human Resources Officer 
 
 Executive Compensation Philosophy and Program Design 
 Philosophy and Goals We have designed our executive compensation program to accomplish the following primary goals: 
 Attract and retain high performers 
 Compensation is competitive to attract and retain high performers 
 When performance objectives are achieved, resulting pay is competitive with market 
 When performance is outstanding and exceeds performance objectives, resulting pay is positioned above, and potentially near the top of, the market 
 Pay for performance The majority of compensation is performance-based (short-and long-term) 
 These performance-based incentives are tied to the achievement of financial and strategic objectives, recognizing company-wide and individual performance 
 Shareholder alignment The value of equity awards is dependent on our stock performance and the achievement of objective financial goals 
 Equity incentives will have the greatest weight in the mix of variable compensation for executives 
 Long-term commitment Equity incentive awards vest over multiple years to align executives with the investment horizon of long-term shareholders 
 After vesting, executives are subject to stock ownership requirements 
 
 These principles are reflected in the following best-practice features of our executive compensation program: 
 What We Do What We Don t Do Emphasize performance-based variable pay Generally, no single trigger change-in-control payments Link significant portion of equity incentive grants to performance goals No significant perquisites Require stock retention by executives and directors No hedging or pledging of Company stock Perform annual risk assessments Retain an independent compensation consultant Maintain an incentive clawback policy

Table of Contents 

 Compensation Components Total direct compensation is composed of four principal components, each one contributing to the accomplishment of our compensation program goals: Compensation Component Description Attract and Retain Pay for Performance Shareholder Alignment Long-term Commitment Base salary 
 A market-competitive salary to provide a fixed annual cash income 
 
 Short-term incentives 
 Annual cash incentive opportunity tied to an assessment of annual corporate and business unit financial performance, as well as individual contributions 

Long-term incentives 
 Equity incentive grants with vesting tied to achievement of earnings-based goals and continued employment 

Executive retirement 
 (US only) 
 Annual retirement plan contributions that vest over three years 

The Committee reviews the executive pay mix on an annual basis. The Committee does not target a fixed percentage allocation among the compensation components, but rather aims to provide the majority of executive officer compensation opportunities in the form of at-risk incentive compensation. 
 Benchmarking and Peer Group Data 
 To attract and retain the best executives for key management positions, we provide compensation opportunities that are competitive based on peer group and survey data. We do not target any specific pay percentile for our executive officers. It is important to note, however, that the majority of pay opportunities for our top executives are incentive-based and that actual realizable compensation is heavily dependent upon actual business results. See Executive Compensation Philosophy and Program Design above. Failure to achieve targeted results could result in realized compensation being below the competitive benchmarks. Conversely, our incentive compensation programs provide opportunities for compensation to exceed the competitive benchmarks if specified objectives are achieved at targeted levels or higher. The Committee believes that actual realizable compensation for our top executives is well aligned with our performance. 
 The Committee asks its independent compensation consultant to conduct an annual competitive compensation review to benchmark compensation for executive officers. Mercer (US) Inc. Mercer ), the Committee s independent compensation consultant, delivered its Fiscal 2024 Executive Compensation Competitive Market Assessment (the FY24 Mercer Executive Compensation Report to the Committee in August 2023 in connection with the Committee s review and evaluation of the executive compensation program and pay levels for fiscal 2024. For that report, Mercer collected competitive pay data for a peer group of 14 publicly traded companies that were reviewed and approved by the Committee in May 2023. 
 There is only one publicly traded company in the marketplace with which we directly compete, FirstCash Holdings, Inc. As a result, the Committee uses a set of similarly-sized companies from relevant industries that serve similar customer bases, operate in the retail or consumer finance industries and typically have similar operating dynamics as the Company. The Committee believes this approach appropriately reflects the diverse labor market for executive talent in which we compete and presents a reasonable reference for evaluating the competitiveness of our executive compensation levels and practices.

 The fiscal 2024 peer group consisted of the following companies: 
 Peer Company Stock Symbol Primary Business The Aaron's Company, Inc. AAN Homefurnishing Retail The Cato Corporation CATO Apparel Retail 
 Conn's, Inc. CONN Computer and Electronics Retail CURO Group Holdings Corp. CURO Consumer Finance 
 Enova International, Inc. ENVA Consumer Finance 
 FirstCash Holdings, Inc. FCFS Consumer Finance Pawn Operator 
 Green Dot Corporation GDOT Consumer Finance LendingClub Corporation LC Consumer Finance 
 LendingTree, Inc. TREE Consumer Finance 
 MoneyGram International, Inc. MGI Data Processing and Outsourced Services Fintech Oportun Financial Corporation OPRT Consumer Finance 
 PRA Group, Inc. PRAA Consumer Finance 
 Regional Management Corp. RM Consumer Finance 
 World Acceptance Corporation WRLD Consumer Finance 
 
 In comparison to the peer group used in fiscal 2023, in fiscal 2024, two companies were removed and three were added. Atlanticus Holdings Corporation was removed due to its revenue size being outside the range of reasonable comparability, and Elevate Credit, Inc. was removed due to it no longer being public. The three companies added (Green Dot Corporation, LendingTree, Inc. and PRA Group Inc.) maintain focus on the Consumer Finance industry. When the peer group was approved by the Committee, Mercer noted that the Company was at the 38th percentile of the peer group in terms of revenue size and at the 49th percentile in terms of market capitalization. 
 To benchmark our executive compensation, Mercer used peer group data from the most recently available proxy filings (CEO and CFO positions and other executive positions where available) and its own executive compensation survey data (for all executive officer positions). Additional data from other published surveys was used as secondary reference points. 
 The FY24 Mercer Executive Compensation Report contained the following general observations, which the Committee took into consideration in evaluating and approving executive compensation for fiscal 2024: 
 Total cash compensation (at target levels) for our executive officers as a group approximates the 59th percentile, with seven of eight executive officers approximating or exceeding the 50th percentile. 
 Long-term incentive compensation (at target levels) is less competitive at below the 25th percentile, with six of eight executive officers below the 50th percentile. 
 As a whole, total direct compensation (cash compensation plus long-term incentive) for our executive officers is at the 45th percentile, with half of our executive officers approximating or exceeding the 50th percentile. 
 Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2024 Executive Compensation Actions 
 Our executive compensation program consists of four main elements: base salaries, short-term cash incentive opportunities, long-term incentive opportunities (generally paid in the form of equity awards) and other benefits, including healthcare and retirement. Each of these components is discussed in more detail below, along with the compensation actions that were taken during fiscal 2024. 
 Base Salary 
 Our primary objective with respect to base salary levels is to provide sufficient fixed cash income to attract and retain experienced leaders in a competitive market. The base salaries of our executive officers are reviewed and adjusted (if appropriate) annually to reflect, among other things, individual performance, review of market data, experience in role, macro-economic conditions and internal equity.

 In October 2024, the Committee determined that the fiscal 2025 base salaries for the Named Executive Officers would be as follows: Mr,. Given, 750,000 (no increase); Mr. Jugmans, 500,000 (5.3 increase); Mr. Coh en, 1,500,000 (no increase); Mr. Powell, 600,000 (no increase); and Ms. VanRoekel, 410,000 (no increase). 
 Annual Short-Term Incentive 
 Our executive officers, as well as other key Team Members, are eligible to participate in our annual short-term incentive STI plan. The plan is designed to provide financial reward contingent on achievement of annual corporate and business unit financial results, as well as personal objectives tied to our strategic goals. 
 The following is a summary of the terms of t he fiscal 2024 STI plan, which th e Committee approved in May 2023: 
 The fiscal 2024 STI plan provides cash bonus opportunities based on achievement of specified performance goals. The bonus opportunity for each participant was determined based on a designated target amount, a business performance modifier based on the achievement of specified EBITDA-based performance goals for the Company as a whole (consolidated) and each business unit, and an assessment of individual performance. 
 Participants were assigned to one of two STI Incentive Pools Consolidated Executive Officer and Consolidated and the total target amount for each pool equaled the aggregate designated target amount for the participants in that pool. The Consolidated Pool also includes three sub-pools based on individual business unit performance. 
 The plan was subject to a Company Performance Gate, such that no pool would be funded if the Company did not achieve the minimum level of Adjusted EBITDA required for a corporate-level payout. 
 If the Company Performance Gate was achieved, then each pool was funded in a range from 0 to 150 of the total target amount assigned to that pool, based on the level of achievement of the applicable performance goal for that pool. 
 The performance goal for both the Consolidated Executive Officer pool and the Consolidated pool was based on the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA shown in the Board-approved budget for fiscal 2024 (excluding any impact of our investment in Cash Converters). The threshold level for each pool (i.e. the performance needed to achieve 50 funding) was set at 85 of the designated performance goal for that pool, and the maximum level (i.e. the performance needed to achieve 150 funding) was set at 115 of the designated performance goal. The Company Performance Gate was set at 85 of the consolidated performance goal. 
 The Committee retained discretionary authority to make adjustments to the reported EBITDA as it, in its sole discretion, determined to be necessary, appropriate or desirable to take into consideration special events or other circumstances reasonably beyond management s control (referred to as Adjusted EBITDA ). 
 Each participant s bonus amount was funded out of their assigned pool based on an evaluation of their individual performance against objectives specified at the beginning of the year. For all participants other than the executive officers, the final bonus amounts were determined by management. For the executive officers (other than the CEO), the final bonus amounts were recommended by the CEO and approved by the Committee. The final bonus amount for the CEO was determined by the Committee.

 246,000 60 
 (1) Mr. Cohen, in his role as Executive Chairman, is not a participant in the STI plan, but is subject to a separate incentive opportunity specified in the terms of his employment. Pursuant to those terms, he had the opportunity to earn an incentive award of up to 1,750,000. See Executive Chairman Incentive Award below. 
 The amount of each Named Executive Officer s STI bonus opportunity at the Threshold, Target and Maximum levels is set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table under Incentive Plan Based Awards below. 
 All of the Named Executive Officers were assigned to the Consolidated Executive Officer pool. During fis cal 2024, th e Company achieved 109 of the specified consolidated performance goal. 
 In addition to the noted financial performance, management was successful in completing specific initiatives that were designed to drive progress across the key strategic focus areas for fis cal 2024, w hich included: 
 Strengthening our core pawn business; 
 Driving cost efficiency; 
 Improving our Team Member experience; 
 Improving and expanding our customer engagement through innovation and growth; 
 Modernizing our IT and data management systems; 
 Enhancing and maintaining our culture of risk management and compliance; and 
 Developing the foundations of a comprehensive and integrated sustainability program. 
 These strategic focus areas provided the foundation for delivering strong financial performance through increased earnings and efficient balance sheet management. 
 Following a consideration of all of these factors, the Committee approved a funding level o f 127 f or the Consolidated Executive Officer pool, which included all of the Named Executive Officers. The specific bonus amount approved for each Named Executive Officer is indicated in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table below. Those amounts were calculated as follows:

 (1) Mr. Cohen s bonus payout was calculated as described below under Executive Chairman Incentive Award. 
 
 In November 2024, the Committee approved the STI plan for fiscal 2025. The fiscal 2025 STI plan contains the same design elements as the fiscal 2024 plan; however the individual business unit sub-pools were removed from the Consolidated Pool. For fiscal 2025, the Target Amounts for each of the Named Executive Officers will be as follows: Mr. Given, 1,125,000; Mr. Jugmans, 500,000; Mr. Powell, 600,000; and Ms. VanRoekel, 246,000. 
 Long-Term Incentives 
 General Long-term incentive LTI compensation, in the form of equity awards, is a key component in our executive compensation program, helping to encourage long-term commitment, shareholder alignment and long-term performance orientation. The value of equity awards over time bears a direct relationship to the price of our stock and the gain or loss experienced by our stockholders. 
 85 

Table of Contents 

 All of our executive officers are eligible to receive LTI awards. We structure our LTI compensation program to place greater emphasis on long-term performance that enhances stockholder value. Many of our peers have a significant time-based vesting component to their long-term awards, while 80 of our LTI awards are subject to performance-based vesting. To further emphasize the long-term nature of these awards, 100 of the LTI awards vest at the end of a three-year performance period, rather than a prorated vesting each year during the performance period. The Committee believes this structure incentivizes and rewards longer-term vision and strategies and provides a balance to our short-term programs, which are focused on annual performance. 
 We are currently issuing LTI awards under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2022 LTI Plan ). Under the terms of the 2022 LTI Plan, all awards must be approved by the full Board of Directors, following recommendation by the Committee. 
 Grant frequency Although LTI awards may be made at any time as determined by the Committee and approved by the Board, the Committee generally considers new LTI grants for executive officers and other key employees on an annual basis. Given that these annual LTI awards are intended to incentivize performance over the full designated performance period, the Committee considers it appropriate to use the stock price at the beginning of the performance period in determining the number of shares or units to be granted. In the Committee s view, this methodology, consistently applied, neutralizes the stock price as a factor impacting the timing of awards. 
 Fiscal 2024 Actions For fiscal 2024, the Committee took the following actions regarding LTI awards: 
 Grant of fiscal 2024 LTI awards In May 2023, the Committee approved the design and structure of the fiscal 2024 LTI awards. In October 2023, the Committee authorized the issuance of awards to the executive officers and other key employees, which awards were granted in October 2023 following approval by the Board. The number of units awarded to each participant was determined by dividing the participant s designated LTI target amount by 8.25, the closing trading price of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock on September 29, 2023. The following table shows the fiscal 2024 LTI awards for the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Cohen, who is subject to a separate incentive program and is not eligible for LTI awards): 
 Named Executive Officer 
 Fiscal 2024 LTI Target Amount 
 Number of Units Lachlan P. Given 2,600,000 315,151 Timothy K. Jugmans 700,000 84,848 John Blair Powell, Jr. 1,200,000 145,454 Lisa VanRoekel 
 350,000 42,424 
 The awards took the form of restricted stock units with the following terms: 
 Performance will be measured over a three-year performance period (fiscal 2024, fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026). 
 Vesting for 80 of the units awarded is subject to performance measured against specified net income targets 20 of the units are allocated to each of the three years in the performance period (with each year measured separately based on an annual Adjusted Net Income performance goal), and 20 of the units are subject to a cumulative performance goal based on Adjusted Net Income growth over the three-year performance period. 
 The Committee continues to consider net income to be the long-term shareholder value metric against which management should be measured, as it reflects the scaling of profitability in a fiscally robust way. Net income takes into account the full bottom-line performance and growth of the Company, including a prudent capital structure; it is the metric that primarily drives our stock price, closely aligning management s interests with those of our shareholders; it is one of the three primary financial goals in the Company s Strategic Goals and Measures framework; and it is less susceptible to manipulation, as EPS often is with debt-financed share buybacks that potentially put financial position at risk. 
 The remaining 20 of the units are subject to time-based vesting, contingent only on continuous active employment through the end of the performance period. 
 The number of performance-based units (whether annual or cumulative) that will be available to vest at the end of the performance period will range from 50 (assuming minimum threshold performance is achieved) and 150 , depending on the level of performance target achievement. There is no bonus unit opportunity for the time-based units, and they will vest at 100 only if the continuous active employment condition is met; otherwise, they will be forfeited. 
 The Committee believes this structure aligns with the Company s business strategy by maintaining executive focus on each year s results but also driving long-term, multi-year performance. Additionally, the Committee determined, with the advice of its independent consultant, that the inclusion of a relatively small time-based element aligns the Company s equity awards with market comparables.

 Vesting of fiscal 2022 awards As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 (the 2022 Annual Report ), the fiscal 2022 LTI awards were approved in October 2021. The basic design of the fiscal 2022 awards is similar to the fiscal 2024 awards discussed above, except that 100 of the units awarded are subject to performance-based vesting (divided equally among the three years in the performance period, fiscal 2022, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024). As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ), the Committee previously determined that 150 of the units allocated to fiscal 2022 and 147 of the units allocated to fiscal 2023 were available for vesting for those participants whose employment continued through fiscal 2024. 
 During fiscal 2024, the Company s Adjusted Net Income performance 84.7 million exceeded the specified performance goal at the target level, and in November 2024, the Committee determined that 133 of the units allocated to fiscal 2024 (along with the units allocated to fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 as described above) were vested for those participants whose employment continued through the end of fiscal 2024. The resulting vesting for the Named Executive Officers was as follows: this includes 235,925 units for Mr. Given, (including 71,325 bonus units); 83,599 units for Mr. Jugmans, (including 25,273 bonus units); 136,168 units for Mr. Powell, (including 41,165 bonus units); and 59,535 units for Ms. VanRoekel, (including 17,996 bonus units). 
 Second-year performance of fiscal 2023 awards As described in our 2023 Annual Report, the fiscal 2023 LTI awards were approved in October 2022. The basic design of the fiscal 2023 awards is substantially similar to the fiscal 2024 awards discussed above, except that the three-year performance period consists of fiscal 2023, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. As reported in the 2023 Annual Report, the Committee determined in November 2023 that 147 of the units allocated to fiscal 2023 were available for vesting for those participants whose employment continues through fiscal 2024. 
 During fiscal 2024, the Company s Adjusted Net Income performance 84.7 million exceeded the specified performance goal at the target level, and in November 2024, the Committee determined that 133 of the units allocated to fiscal 2024 were available for vesting for those participants whose employment continues through the end of fiscal 2025. For the Named Executive Officers, this includes 69,001 units for Mr. Given (including 17,120 bonus units); 17,250 units for Mr. Jugmans (including 4,280 bonus units); 28,463 units for Mr. Powell (including 7,062 bonus units); and 11,316 units for Ms. VanRoekel (including 2,807 bonus units). 
 First-year performance of fiscal 2024 awards During fiscal 2024, the Company s Adjusted Net Income performance 84.7 million exceeded the specified performance goal at the target level, and in November 2024, the Committee determined that 133 of the units allocated to fiscal 2024 are available for vesting for those participants whose employment continues through the end of fiscal 2026. For the Named Executive Officers, this includes 83,829 units for Mr. Given (including 20,799 bonus units); 22,568 units for Mr. Jugmans (including 5,599 bonus units); 38,689 units for Mr. Powell (including 9,599 bonus units); and 11,283 units for Ms. VanRoekel (including 2,799 bonus units). 
 Grant of fiscal 2025 Awards In October 2024, the Committee approved the plan design for the fiscal 2025 LTI awards. The approved design is substantially identical to the fiscal 2024 awards described above, except that the three-year performance period covers fiscal 2025, fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027. The fiscal 2025 LTI awards were granted in November 2024 following approval by the Board. The number of units awarded to each participant was determined by dividing the participant s designated LTI target amount by 11.21, the closing trading price of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock on September 30, 2024. The following table shows the fiscal 2025 LTI awards for the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Cohen, who is subject to a separate incentive program and is not eligible for LTI awards): 
 Named Executive Officer (1) Fiscal 2025 LTI Target Amount 
 Number of Units Lachlan P. Given 3,000,000 267,618 Timothy K. Jugmans 900,000 80,285 John Blair Powell, Jr. 1,200,000 107,047 Lisa VanRoekel 400,000 35,682 
 (1) In October 2024, the Committee approved increases in the LTI target amounts for Mr. Given (from 2,600,000 to 3,000,000), Mr. Jugmans (from 700,000 to 900,000), and Ms. VanRoekel (from 350,000 to 400,000). These changes better align the executives long-term incentive compensation and total direct compensation with peer group executives in comparable positions (at the 41st percentile and 43rd percentile, respectively, for Mr. Given; at the 43rd percentile and 45th percentile, respectively, for Mr. Jugmans; and at the 43rd percentile and 63rd percentile, respectively, for Ms. VanRoekel), and is consistent with the Company s pay-for-performance philosophy and emphasis on long-term compensation.

 Executive Chairman Incentive Award 
 As Executive Chairman, Mr. Cohen has an incentive compensation opportunity of 1,750,000 per year, awarded in the form of cash-settled phantom stock units Units tied to the trading price of the Company s Class A Common Stock, as follows: 
 Award At the beginning of a fiscal year (the Performance Year ), the number of Units awarded is determined by dividing 1,750,000 by the stock price at the close of the immediately preceding fiscal year. 
 Vesting The awarded Units vest at the end of the Performance Year so long as the Company Performance Gate under the Company s STI plan for the Performance Year has been achieved. The Company Performance Gate is the level of performance (generally measured in terms of Adjusted EBITDA) needed to achieve any payout under the STI plan. Even if the Company Performance Gate is achieved, the Committee in its discretion may reduce the number of Units that vest based upon the Committee s evaluation of Mr. Cohen s achievement of individual performance objectives. Conversely, if the Company Performance Gate is not achieved, the Committee in its discretion may choose to vest some or all of the Units based an evaluation of Mr. Cohen s achievement of individual performance objectives. 
 Payout The vested Units will be paid out in two installments. The first installment will be paid as soon as practicable after the end of the Performance Year and will be an amount of cash equal to 50 of the vested Units multiplied by the stock price at the end of the Performance Year. The second installment will be paid out at the end of the next fiscal year and will be an amount of cash equal to 50 of the vested Units multiplied by the stock price at that time. 
 At the beginning of fiscal 2024, Mr. Cohen received 212,121 Units (the FY24 Units ), which was calculated by dividing the bonus opportunity 1,750,000) by 8.25, the closing trading price of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock on September 29, 2023. In September 2024, the Committee reviewed and evaluated Mr. Cohen s individual performance during fiscal 2024, noting Mr. Cohen s valuable contributions in key strategic areas, including the following: 
 Providing leadership and mentorship to the CEO, COO and CFO; 
 Providing counsel and advice on development and execution of strategic plan; 
 Providing direction, high-level involvement and support on key growth initiatives, including acquisitions, strategic investments and partnerships and de novo developments; 
 Providing counsel and operational guidance to improve store-level performance and Team Member engagement; and 
 Providing thought leadership and guidance on financing and capital allocation strategies. 
 As noted above, the Committee has determined that the Company Performance Gate under the fiscal 2024 STI plan has been achieved. See Annual Short-Term Incentive above. Consequently, and taking into consideration the Committee s evaluation of Mr. Cohen s individual performance, the Committee approved the vesting of 100 of the FY24 Units. Under the terms of Mr. Cohen s incentive opportunity, 50 of those Units (or 106,060 Units) will be paid out on a per-Unit value of 11.21 (the closing trading price of our Class A Common Stock on September 30, 2024), translating to a cash payout of 1,188,933. The remaining 50 of the FY24 Units (106,061 Units) will be paid at the end of fiscal 2025 based on the closing trading price of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock at that time. 
 In September 2024, the Committee maintained Mr. Cohen s incentive compensation opportunity at 1,750,000, and for fiscal 2025, Mr. Cohen received 156,110 Units (the FY25 Units ), which was calculated by dividing the bonus opportunity 1,750,000) by 11.21, the closing trading price of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock on September 30, 2024. The FY25 Units will be subject to the vesting and payout terms described above. 
 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
 We provide selected executives with a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP to offer a competitive benefit and to assist in offsetting potential impacts of contribution limitations applicable to our 401(k) retirement savings plan. For fiscal 2024, the Committee approved SERP contributions for each of the executive officers equal to 10 of base salary. This resulted in the following SERP contributions for each of the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Cohen who is not eligible for SERP contributions): 
 Named Executive Officer Fiscal 2024 SERP Contribution Lachlan P. Given 
 75,000 Timothy K. Jugmans 
 47,500 John Blair Powell, Jr. 
 60,000 Lisa VanRoekel

Table of Contents 

 In September 2024, the Committee approved fiscal 2025 SERP contributions equal to 10 of base salary for each of the executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen). For the Named Executive Officers, those contributions were 75,000 for Mr. Given, 50,000 for Mr. Jugmans, 60,000 for Mr. Powell and 41,000 for Ms. VanRoekel. 
 Other Benefits and Perquisites 
 The executive officers participate in other benefit plans on the same terms as other Team Members. These plans include medical, dental, life insurance and our 401(k) retirement savings plan. In addition, we provide supplemental healthcare benefits to our executive officers. The amount of that benefit for the Named Executive Officers is included in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table below. 
 Executive Compensation Governance and Process 
 Composition of the People and Compensation Committee 
 The People and Compensation Committee is comprised of four members Mr. Lagos (Chair), Mr. Appel, Ms. Arnold and Mr. Tillett each of whom is an independent director. See Part III, Item 10 Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Board of Directors. 
 Role of the Committee 
 The Board of Directors has authorized the Committee to establish the compensation programs for all executive officers and to provide oversight for compliance with our compensation philosophy. The Committee delegates the day-to-day administration of the compensation plans to management and retains responsibility for ensuring that the plan administration is consistent with our policies. 
 Annually, the Committee sets the compensation for our executive officers, including objectives and awards under incentive plans (subject to approval of LTI awards by the Board of Directors). The Committee also reviews all other proposed LTI awards and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors on proposed LTI awards and the appropriate compensation for the non-employee directors. 
 The Committee also oversees the Company s human capital management (HCM) strategy, policies and activities, including succession planning and corresponding individual development in order to maintain the talent necessary to fulfill our operational and strategic objectives; diversity and inclusion initiatives; Team Member engagement; and assessing the overall effectiveness of our HCM programs. For more information on the Committee's role, see Part III, Item 10 Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Committees of the Board People and Compensation Committee, as well as the Committee's charter, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ezcorp.com. 
 Role of Management 
 The Committee receives data regarding compensation trends, succession plans, issues and recommendations from management. Members of management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Legal Officer, attend Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer provides input on individual performance and recommendations regarding compensation adjustments to the Committee for executive officer positions other than his own. 
 Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
 Under its charter, the Committee has sole authority to retain, terminate, obtain advice from, oversee and compensate its outside advisors, including its compensation consultant. We have provided appropriate funding to the Committee to do so. 
 Since March 2020, the Committee has retained Mercer as its independent compensation consultant. The Committee s independent compensation consultant reports directly to the Committee, and the Committee may replace its independent compensation consultant or hire additional consultants at any time. The Committee s independent compensation consultant communicates with, and attends meetings of, the Committee as requested. 
 The Committee annually evaluates the independence of its independent compensation consultant in providing executive compensation consulting services, and to date has found no conflict of interest with respect to Mercer. 
 During fiscal 2024, Mercer, among other things, advised the Committee on the principal aspects of our executive compensation program, updated the Committee on evolving best practices and provided market information and analysis regarding the competitiveness of our program design and award values. 
 Compensation Risk 
 The Committee continually monitors our general compensation practices, specifically the design, administration and assessment of our incentive plans, to identify any components, measurement factors or potential outcomes that might create an incentive for excessive risk-

 taking detrimental to the Company. The Committee has determined that our compensation plans and policies do not encourage excessive risk-taking. 
 Our executive compensation program provides a balance of short-term and long-term incentives that reward achievement of profitable, consistent and sustainable results. These include: 
 Annual incentive compensation tied to achievement of profitable Company or business unit performance (as measured by consolidated and/or business unit EBITDA); 
 Meaningful long-term equity incentive opportunities that are substantially performance-based and provide an incentive to deliver long-term growth in stockholder value as a result of sustained earnings growth. 
 We maintain the following policies to mitigate compensation risk: 
 Compensation Recovery Policy The Board of Directors has adopted a Compensation Recovery Policy that complies with the requirements of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Under the policy, the Company generally is required to take reasonably prompt action to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the persons subject to the policy (including the executive officers) if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the Company s material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. Erroneously Awarded Compensation is the amount of incentive compensation received by a covered person in excess of the amount that would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts. A copy of the Compensation Recovery Policy, which became effective on August 1, 2023, is filed as an exhibit to this Report. 
 Anti-Hedging Policy We maintain a policy prohibiting the trading of derivative securities related to, or engaging in short sales of, our stock by members of the Board of Directors, executive officers or any other persons associated or affiliated with the Company (through employment, contractual relationship or otherwise) who are designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. For purposes of the policy, a derivative security is any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege at a price related to our stock, or similar securities with a value derived from the value of our stock; and a short sale is any sale of stock that the seller does not own or any sale that is consummated by the delivery of stock borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. The Board believes that this policy, by preventing the shifting of the risks of ownership of Company stock, helps to align the interests of management with the interests of the other Company stockholders. 
 Executive Share Retention Policy The Board of Directors has adopted stock ownership requirements applicable to the members of the Board of Directors and the executive officers. Pursuant to those requirements, each non-executive member of the Board of Directors and each executive officer is required to hold a number of shares of Class A Non-Voting Common Stock having a market value equal to the applicable Required Multiple of the annual retainer fee (in the case of the non-executive directors) or base salary (in the case of the executive officers). The Required Multiple is 4X for the non-executive directors and the CEO, 2X for the Executive Chairman and 1X for the other executive officers. Each person subject to the stock ownership requirements is required to hold at least 50 (in the case of the non-executive directors) or 30 (in the case of the executive officers) of each vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units until the required stock ownership amount is satisfied. Thereafter, such person can sell shares (subject to our trading window policy) as long as the required stock ownership amount is maintained. Because each share of Class B Voting Common Stock is convertible into a share of Class A Non-Voting Common Stock, the shares of Class B Voting Common Stock held by Mr. Cohen are treated as the equivalent number of shares of Class A Non-Voting Common Stock for purposes of applying the stock ownership requirements. 
 All directors and executive officers are currently in compliance with the stock ownership requirements.

 Other Executive Compensation Matters 
 Change in Control Severance Plan The executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen) are participants in the EZCORP, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan (the CIC Severance Plan ), which was approved and adopted by the Board of Directors in November 2022. A participant in the CIC Severance Plan is entitled to receive certain severance benefits if both of the following events occur (a double trigger ): The Company experiences a change in control and the executive s employment is terminated within two years thereafter. The severance benefits include a cash payment equal to (1) a multiple of the participant s annual base salary and target STI bonus plus (2) the participant s prorated target bonus for the year in which the termination occurs. In addition, the Company will provide continued healthcare benefits for a number of years equal to the applicable multiple. The multiple referred to varies by executive officer, with the CEO, COO and CFO having multiples of 2.0 and the remaining executive officer participants having multiples of 1.5. 
 The Board of Directors has also approved amendments to the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan and all outstanding LTI awards to provide for the acceleration of vesting (at target levels, in the case of performance-based awards) upon the occurrence of a qualifying termination following a change in control. This acceleration of vesting benefit applies to the CIC Severance Plan participants, as well as all other holders of outstanding LTI awards. 
 Generally, for purposes of the CIC Severance Plan, a change in control will be deemed to have occurred if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 50 or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding Company securities, either directly or through consummation of a business combination; provided, however, that any acquisition or beneficial ownership of voting securities by, or a transfer of voting securities to, Mr. Cohen, any of his heirs or any entity that is owned or controlled by Mr. Cohen or any of his heirs, shall not constitute a change in control. 
 The foregoing is a summary description of the principal terms of the CIC Severance Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full terms and provisions set forth in the plan document, which is filed as an exhibit to this Report. 
 Other severance benefits We provide the following other severance benefits to our executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen): 
 Unless severance benefits under the CIC Severance Plan are triggered, each of our executive officers will receive one year s base salary (as a lump sum or in the form of salary continuation) if their employment is terminated by the Company without cause. 
 Generally, restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, including those granted to the executive officers, provide for accelerated vesting of some or all of the unvested shares or units in the event of the holder's death or disability. 
 More information on severance arrangements can be found under Other Benefit Plans Certain Termination Benefits below. The Committee believes that these benefits provide important protection to the executive officers, are consistent with practice of the peer companies and are appropriate for attraction and retention of executive talent. 
 Restrictive Covenant Agreements Each of our executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen), along with other key Team Members, has entered into a Restrictive Covenant Agreement under which the executive is subject to confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations with respect to various categories of proprietary, competitively sensitive and confidential information. In addition, each such executive has agreed that, for a period of one year following the termination of employment with the Company, they will not compete with the Compan y (within a defined area) and will not solicit the Company's Team Members or suppliers. 
 Employment Contract for Mr. Given On November 14, 2023, we entered into an Employment Contract with Mr. Given, our Chief Executive Officer, who resides in London, England. The Employment Contract was entered into to comply with U.K. employment laws and is not intended to alter the fundamental elements of Mr. Given s employment relationship, including the compensatory arrangement as reflected in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The terms of the Employment Contract mirror as close as possible the terms of Mr. Given s pre-existing U.S. employment, although certain modifications were necessary to adapt to a U.K. employment environment, particularly with regards to healthcare and other benefits. All compensation received by Mr. Given under the Employment Contract is reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below, including the All Other Compensation column, which includes healthcare and other benefits. 
 
 Compensation Committee Report 
 The Compensation Committee has reviewed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis and has discussed it with management. Based on that review and those discussions, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.

 CEO Pay Ratio 
 The fo llowing information sets forth our calculation of the ratio between the annual total compensation of Lachlan P. Given, our Chief Executive Officer, and the annual total compensation of our median Team Member CEO Pay Ratio ). 
 Mr. Given s total annual compensation for fiscal 2024 was 5,206,596. That number is derived from the numbers set forth in the Summary Compensation Table above. 
 Our median Team Member s total annual compensation for fiscal 2024 was 18,137, consisting of gross annual wages, bonuses, overtime pay and other benefits. 
 Based on those numbers, our CEO Pay ratio for fiscal 2024 is 287:1. 
 Our CEO Pay Ratio is based on the following methodology: 
 When we identified our median Team Member, we selected gross wages paid during fiscal 2024 as the most appropriate measure of compensation and applied that measure consistently across our global population. Gross wages generally include salary and wages (regular, hourly and overtime), commissions and bonuses. We annualized the compensation of all permanent full-time and part-time Team Members as of September 30, 2024. 
 We calculated the median Team Member s total annual compensation in accordance with the rules used to calculate the CEO s compensation included in the Summary Compensation Table above. 
 Using this methodology, we determined that our median Team Member was a full-time certified store manager located in Mexico where Team Member wages and cost of living are significantly lower than the U.S. 
 In calculating CEO pay ratios, companies are permitted to adopt a variety of methodologies, apply certain exclusions and make reasonable estimates and assumptions reflecting their unique employee populations. Therefore, our CEO Pay Ratio, as described above, may not be comparable to CEO pay ratios reported by other companies due to differences in industries and geographical dispersion of employees, as well as the different estimates, assumptions and meth odologies applied by other companies in calculating their CEO pay ratios.

 (1) These amounts represent the potential payouts under the fiscal 2024 Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. See Compensation Discussion and Analysis Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2024 Executive Compensation Actions Annual Incentive Bonuses above. The Target amount is the amount that would be paid if the specified performance goals are achieved at the target level (although the People and Compensation Committee may reduce any award if it chooses to do so). The Threshold reflects the amount that would be paid if the minimum performance goals are achieved, while the Maximum amount represents the maximum amount that would be paid if the maximum performance goals are achieved or exceeded. See the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table above for the amount of the actual payout for each of the Named Executive Officers. 
 (2) The amounts shown represent long-term incentive (LTI) awards (stated in number of units) under our Long-Term Incentive Plans. See Compensation Discussion and Analysis Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2024 Executive Compensation Actions Long-Term Incentives. 
 (3) Represents the estimated grant date fair value of the fiscal 2024 LTI awards, assuming payout at Target level. This is the estimated amount of aggregate compensation cost we expect to recognize over the performance period, determined as of the grant date. Because of the structure of the fiscal 2024 awards (as described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2024 Executive Compensation Actions Long-Term Incentives Fiscal 2024 Actions Grant of Fiscal 2024 Awards above), each annual tranche of the awards is treated as a separate award for accounting purposes. Consequently, the amount shown represents the grant date fair value of the first annual tranche (20 of the award) plus the grant date fair value of the cumulative three-year performance tranche (20 of the award) plus the grant date fair value of the time-based tranche (20 of the award). The grant date fair value of the second and third annual tranches will be reflected in future years when the performance conditions for those tranches are established and they are deemed to be granted for accounting purposes.

 Other Benefits and Perquisites 
 401(k) Retirement Plan All U.S. Team Members are given an opportunity to participate in our 401(k) retirement savings plan (following a new-hire waiting period). Subject to statutory limits of the IRS, this plan allows participants to have pre-tax amounts withheld from their pay and provides for a discretionary employer matching contribution (historically, 25 up to 6 of salary). Matching contributions are made in the form of cas h. Participants may invest their contributions in various fund options, but are prohibited from investing their contributions in our common stock. A parti cipant vests in the matching contributions over the first three years of service, provided the hours worked requirement is met. A participant s matching contributions vest 100 in the event of death, disability or termination of the plan due to a change in control. 
 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan We provide U.S. executive officers with a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP to offer a competitive benefit and to assist in offsetting potential impacts of contribution limitations applicable to our 401(k) retirement savings plan. The SERP has similar investment options as are available under the 401(k) retirement savings plan. Company contributions to the SERP are formula-based, reviewed and approved by the People and Compensation Committee each year. For fiscal 2024, our annual contributions to the SERP were calculated as 10 of base salary. For fiscal 2025, the Company contributions to the SERP will continue at the same rates for executive officers. Under the terms of the SERP, participants are also allowed to voluntarily defer all or a portion of their salary and bonus payments into the SERP. There were eight participants during fiscal 2024. 
 All Company contributed SERP funds have a vesting schedule as an additional retention tool. Generally, the funds vest over three years from the contribution date, with one-third vesting each year. All of a participant s Company contributed SERP funds vest 100 in the event of the participant s death or disability or the termination of the plan due to a change in control. In addition, all Company contributed SERP funds are 100 vested when a participant attains age 50 and five years of active service. All Company contributed SERP funds are forfeited, regardless of vesting status, if the participant s employment is terminated for cause. 
 A participant may not withdraw any portion of his or her SERP account while still employed by the Company unless, in the sole opinion of management, the participant has an unforeseeable emergency, which is defined as a severe financial hardship resulting from an illness or accident of the participant, the participant s spouse or a dependent; the loss of the participant s property due to casualty; or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstance arising as a result of events beyond the participant s control.

 Certain Termination and Change-in-Control Benefits The following is a summary of various agreements that provide for benefits to the continuing Named Executive Officers upon termination of employment or a change-in-control: 
 Restricted Stock Award Agreements The standard restricted stock award agreement pursuant to which we grant restricted stock or restricted stock units to our Team Members generally provides that vesting is accelerated in the event of the holder s death or disability. 
 SERP Contributions For all executives who participate in the SERP (including the Named Executive Officers), any unvested Company contributions to the SERP will vest in the case of death or disability of the participant or a change in control. 
 General Severance Benefits We currently provide each of our executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen) with one-year salary continuation if his or her employment is terminated by the Company without cause. This severance benefit is reflected in the terms of Mr. Given s U.K. Employment Contract. See Compensation Discussion and Analysis Other Executive Compensation Matters Employment Contract for Mr. Given. 
 Change in Control Severance Benefits The executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen) are subject to the Change in Control Severance Plan, which provides them with certain severance benefits in the form cash payments and continued healthcare benefits in the event that their employment is terminated in connection with or within two years following a change in control of the Company. See Compensation Discussion and Analysis Other Executive Compensation Matters Change in Control Severance Plan.

 Director Compensation 
 Each non-employee director receives a basic annual retainer fee, with the Lead Independent Director, the chair of the Audit and Risk Committee and the chair of the People and Compensation Committee each receiving an additional amount. During fiscal 2023 the basic annual retainer fee was 80,000, and additional amounts paid to the Lead Independent Director, the chair of the Audit and Risk Committee and the chair of the People and Compensation Committee were 40,000, 27,500 and 15,000, respectively. Annual retainer fees are paid in cash on a quarterly basis. 
 The non-employee directors are also eligible for stock option and restricted stock awards. The number of options or shares of restricted stock awarded, as well as the other terms and conditions of the awards (such as vesting and exercisability schedules and termination provisions), are determined by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the People and Compensation Committee. Historically, the directors have each received an annual restricted stock award with a grant date value equal to 2X the annual retainer fee. The annual award cycle is based on our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is generally held in February or March of each year, with the awards being granted on the date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders and vesting on the day immediately preceding the date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in the following year (but no later than March 31). 
 The following table sets forth the compensation paid to our non-employee directors for fiscal 2024. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Given are executive officers of the Company and do not receive any additional compensation for serving on the Board of Directors.

 (1) Amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock awards, computed in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10-25. See Note 8: Common Stock And Stock Compensation of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . The actual value realized by the director with respect to stock awards will depend on the market value of our stock on the date the stock is sold. 
 Each of the non-employee directors received a grant of 15,037 shares of restricted stock on March 21, 2024. That amount was determined by dividing 160,000 (2X the annual director fee) by 10.64, the trading price of the Class A Common Stock at the time of grant. These shares are scheduled to vest immediately before the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (but no later than March 31, 2025). 
 As of September 30, 2024, each of the continuing non-employee directors held 15,037 shares of unvested restricted stock. 
 
 The non-employee director compensation program for fiscal 2025 will generally be the same as the fiscal 2024 program described above.

 ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
 Related Party Transactions 
 Review and Approval of Transactions with Related Persons 
 The Board of Directors has adopted a written comprehensive policy for the review and evaluation of all related party transactions. Under that policy, the Audit and Risk Committee is charged with the responsibility of (a) reviewing and evaluating all transactions, or proposed transactions, between the Company and a related person and (b) approving, ratifying, rescinding or taking other action with respect to each such transaction. With respect to any specific transaction, the Audit and Risk Committee may, in its discretion, transfer its responsibilities to either the full Board of Directors or to any special committee of the Board of Directors designated and created for the purpose of reviewing, evaluating, approving or ratifying such transaction. 
 Employment arrangement with Nicholas Cohen 
 Nicholas Cohen, the son of Phillip E. Cohen, the beneficial owner of all of our Class B Voting Common Stock and our Executive Chairman, has been an employee of the Company since May 2018, currently serving in the position of Vice President, Business Development. The Company considers the employment relationship with Nicholas Cohen to be a related party transaction that is subject to the Company s Policy for Review and Evaluation of Related Party Transactions. Accordingly, the Audit and Risk Committee reviews and approves all promotion opportunities and compensation changes for Nicholas Cohen. 
 Director Independence 
 The Board of Directors believes that the interests of the stockholders are best served by having a substantial number of objective, independent representatives on the Board. For this purpose, a director is considered to be independent if the Board determines that the director does not have any direct or indirect material relationship with the Company that may impair, or appear to impair, the director s ability to make independent judgments. 
 The Board has evaluated all relationships between the Company and each of the persons who served as a director during any portion of fiscal 2024 and has made the following determinations with respect to each director s independence: Director Status (a) Matthew W. Appel Independent Zena Srivatsa Arnold Independent Phillip E. Cohen Not independent (b) Lachlan P. Given Not independent (b) Jason A. Kulas Not independent (b) Pablo Lagos Espinosa Independent Gary L. Tillett Independent 
 (a) The Board s determination that a director is independent was made on the basis of the standards for independence set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Under those standards, a person generally will not be considered independent if he or she has a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Nasdaq rules also describe specific relationships that will prevent a person from being considered independent. 
 (b) Mr. Cohen and Mr. Given were executive officers of the Company during all of fiscal 2024, and Mr. Kulas was an executive officer of the Company from February 2020 until January 2022. Therefore, they are not independent in accordance with the standards set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules.

INSIDER TRADING POLICY 
 
 1. INTRODUCTION This policy provides detailed information about the treatment of material, non-public information related to the EZCORP, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates (the Company and the rules pertaining to such information with which all directors, officers, employees, contractors, and consultants are expected to comply. 2. DEFINITIONS Material Information - Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood a reasonable investor would consider the information as significantly altering the total mix of information available. Thus, information may be material if it is likely that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making a decision to buy, hold, or sell securities. Any information that could be expected to affect the Company s stock price, whether it is positive or negative, should be considered material. Examples of information that could be, but is not necessarily, material are 
 Financial results (annual, quarterly or otherwise), including earnings that are inconsistent with the Company s consensus expectations of the investment community or guidance, if any 
 Projections of future earnings or losses, or other earnings guidance 
 A pending or proposed merger, acquisition or tender offer 
 A pending or proposed acquisition or disposition of a significant asset 
 A change in dividend policy, declaration of stock split or other offering of securities 
 Significant changes in the Company s credit ratings 
 Significant corporate events, including material cyber, data or personnel matters 
 Major personnel changes ,particularly departures or elections of executive officers or certain directors 
 Development of a significant new product, service or process 
 Impending bankruptcy or the existence of severe liquidity problems 
 The gain or loss of a significant customer or supplier and 
 Significant actions or threats of actions by regulatory bodies or litigation related to the Company. 
 If you are uncertain whether the information is material, please consult with the Chief Legal Officer. 
 Non-Public Information Information is non-public if it has not been previously disclosed to the general public and is otherwise not generally available to the investing public. In order for information to be considered public, it must be widely disseminated in a manner making it generally available to the investing public with enough time for the investing public to absorb the information fully. 

3. POLICY 3.1 Prohibited Transactions . It is the policy of the Company that no director, officer, employee, contractor or consultant of the Company who is aware of Material, Non-Public Information relating to the Company may, directly or through Related Persons (as defined below), (a) engage in any transaction in the Company s securities, including by buying, selling or gifting securities of the Company, or (b) disclosing or tipping that information, either directly or indirectly, on to others outside the Company who may transact in the Company s securities, except as permitted by this policy . 
 In addition, it is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or other employee or consultant of the Company who, in the course of working for the Company, learns of Material, Non-Public Information about a company with which the Company does business, including a customer or supplier of the Company, may trade in that company s securities until the information becomes public or is no longer material 
 3.2 Mandatory Advance Notification and Approval Procedures 
 All directors and officers and their Related Persons (each a Covered Person are subject to the mandatory advance notification and approval requirements. Any Covered Person who intends to transact in the Company s securities must review the proposed transaction in advance with the Chief Legal Officer or their designee trading ezcorp.com ). 
 You should provide the Chief Legal Officer with information regarding the type of transaction and the number of shares involved, and either confirm that you possess no Material, Non-Public Information concerning the Company or inform the reviewer of any circumstances that you believe could present an issue in that regard. The reviewer will subsequently contact you in writing to communicate any position the Company has on the proposed transaction. You may not engage in the transaction unless you receive approval from the Chief Legal Officer. If you receive approval but you do not execute the transaction within four business days after the transaction is reviewed and approved, you should check with the reviewer again before entering into the transaction. Please allow sufficient time (at least two business days) for consideration of a proposed transaction under the advance notification and approval requirements. 
 The clearance of a proposed transaction by the Chief Legal Officer does not constitute legal advice or otherwise acknowledge that you do not possess Material, Non-Public Information. You must ultimately make your own judgments regarding, and are personally responsible for determining, whether you are in possession of m Material, Non-Public Information. 
 The existence of the foregoing approval procedures does not obligate the Company to approve any transaction involving Company securities. The Chief Legal Officer may reject any approval request in their discretion, subject to review by, and the discretion of, the Chief Executive Officer. 

3.3 Blackout Periods 
 The Company has designated blackout periods when it is more likely that you have Material, Non-Public Information. You may not trade in the Company s securities during any of these designated blackout periods. These blackout periods begin on the 16 th day of the last month of each quarter (December 16, March 16, June 16, and September 16) and continue until two business days after the Company s earnings announcement. 
 The Company may make an announcement of material information not related to periodic earnings. In this case, you should not trade in the Company s securities for two business days after the announcement. Depending on the particular circumstances, the Company may determine that a longer or shorter blackout period should apply to the release of Material, Non-Public Information . If you have any questions about whether the information is public or about designated blackout periods, you must consult with the Company s Chief Legal Officer. 
 3.4 Additional Restrictions in Specific Circumstances 
 From time to time, the Company may recommend or require that directors, officers, selected employees and others refrain from trading because of developments known to the Company and not yet disclosed to the public. In such a case, the persons so advised should not engage in any transaction involving the Company s securities until advised that the restriction has been terminated and should not disclose to others inside or outside of the Company the fact that the Company has imposed a trading restriction. 
 3.5 No Safe Harbor 
 The existence of blackout periods and situation-specific trading restrictions should not be considered a safe harbor for trading during other periods, and all directors, officers and other employees or consultants should use good judgment at all times . 
 3.6 Transactions by Related Persons 
 This policy also applies to anyone who lives in your household, any family members who do not live in your household but whose transactions in the Company s securities are directed by you or are subject to your influence or control (such as parents or children who consult with you before they trade in Company s securities), and entities over which you have actual control, directly or indirectly (collectively, Related Persons ). You are responsible for the transactions of these Related Persons and therefore should make them aware of the need to confer with you before they trade in the Company s securities. 

3.7 Permitted Transactions 
 Regardless of whether you are in possession of material, non-public information, the following transactions are permitted by this Policy, except as specifically noted 
 Restricted Stock Awards This policy permits the grant or vesting of an award of restricted stock, or the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of any restricted stock. This policy does not permit, however, any market sale of restricted stock. 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 Plans This policy permits transactions made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Plan. A Rule 10b5-1 Plan is a written plan for transacting in the Company securities that, at the time it is adopted or modified, conforms to all of the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 as then in effect. Everyone must obtain authorization from the Chief Legal Officer before entering into or modifying a Rule 10b5-1 Plan. Transactions made under an approved Rule 10b-5 Plan are not subject to quarterly trading restrictions or pre-clearance requirements. 
 
 Stock Option Exercises This policy permits the exercise or settlement of an employee stock option or other stock-based compensation acquired pursuant to a Company stock option plan, or to the exercise of a tax withholding right or net settlement pursuant to which the Company withholds shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements or the exercise price. This policy does not permit, however, any sale of stock as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option, or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option. 
 
 401(k) Plan This policy permits purchases of Company stock in a 401(k) plan resulting from your periodic contribution of money to the plan pursuant to your payroll deduction election and elections to suspend entirely future payroll deductions designated for the purchase of Company common stock through any Company 401(k) plan. This policy does not permit, however, certain elections you may make under a 401(k) plan, including (a) an election to increase or decrease the percentage of your periodic contributions that will be allocated to the Company stock fund, (b) an election to make an intra-plan transfer of an existing account balance into or out of the Company stock fund, (c) an election to borrow money against your 401(k) plan account if the loan will result in a liquidation of some or all of your Company stock fund balance, and (d) your election to pre-pay a plan loan if the pre-payment will result in allocation of loan proceeds to the Company stock fund. 
 
 Approved Transactions Any transaction approved in writing in advance by the Chief Legal Officer, subject to the terms of the requestor s disclosure. 

3.8 Additional Prohibited Transactions 
 No one may engage in any of the following transactions 
 Post-Termination Transactions This policy continues to apply to your transactions in the Company s securities even after you have terminated employment. If you are in possession of Material, Non-Public Information when your employment terminates, you may not trade in the Company s securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. 
 
 Other Transactions Other transactions in the Company s securities that are barred by any other Company policy, including as described in the Company s Derivative Trading Policy. 
 3.9 Duty to Report 
 Any director, officer or other employee or consultant who violates this policy or any federal or state laws governing insider trading or tipping, or knows of any such violation by any other employee, officer or director, must report the violation immediately to the Chief Legal Officer. Upon learning of any such violation, the Chief Legal Officer, in consultation with the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will determine whether the Company should release any Material, Non-Public Information or whether the Company should report the violation to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or other appropriate governmental authority. 
 4. SCOPE This policy applies to all directors, officers, employees, consultants, and contractors of the Company. As noted above, this policy also applies to Related Persons of the aforementioned parties. 

5. COMPLIANCE The Legal Department is responsible for administering and enforcing the policy. 
 Failure to comply with this policy may subject a director, officer, employee, contractor or consultant to civil or criminal penalties. Violations of this policy also may result in Company-imposed sanctions, including disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
 A violation of this policy is not necessarily the same as a violation of law. The Company reserves the right to determine, in its own discretion and on the basis of the information available to it, whether this policy has been violated. The Company may determine that specific conduct violates this policy, whether or not the conduct also violates the law. It is not necessary for the Company to await the filing or conclusion of a civil or criminal action against the alleged violator before taking disciplinary action 
 Any person who has a question about this policy or its application to any proposed transaction may obtain additional guidance from the Chief Legal Officer by contacting trading ezcorp.com. Ultimately, however, the responsibility for adhering to this policy and avoiding unlawful transactions rests with the individual employee. 
 Directors and officers are subject to additional restrictions on their transactions in Company securities, which are described in a separate memorandum. 
 6. APPROVED BY 
 This policy was approved by the Executive Committee. The policy will be reviewed periodically and updated as needed.

Compensation Recovery Policy 
 
 This Compensation Recovery Policy is adopted to address recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation from Covered Persons in the event of an Accounting Restatement, as further described herein. Terms used herein with their initial letter capitalized have the meanings ascribed to them under Definitions below. 
 
 Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation 
 If the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall take reasonably prompt action to recover all Erroneously Awarded Compensation from any Covered Person (except as described under Exceptions to Recovery below). 
 This Policy is in addition to any right of repayment, forfeiture or offset against any Covered Person that may be available under applicable law or otherwise, whether implemented prior to or after the effective date of this Policy. The Board or any authorized committee thereof, each in its sole discretion and in the exercise of its business judgment, may determine whether and to what extent additional action is appropriate to address the circumstances surrounding any Accounting Restatement to minimize the likelihood of any recurrence and to impose such other discipline as it deems necessary, appropriate or desirable. 
 Compensation Subject to Recovery 
 Erroneously Awarded Compensation, with respect to any Covered Person, is the amount of Incentive Compensation Received by such Covered Person in excess of the amount of Incentive Compensation that would have been Received by such Covered Person had such Incentive Compensation been determined based on the restated amounts. Such amount shall be computed without regard to any taxes paid. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, only Incentive Compensation that is Received by a Covered Person (a) after beginning service as an Executive Officer, (b) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period associated with that Incentive Compensation, (c) while the Company had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or national securities association and (d) during the Recovery Period shall be subject to recovery as Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 
 For Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from information included in the Accounting Restatement, the amount of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be determined by the P&C Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive Compensation was based. The Company shall maintain the documentation of such reasonable estimate as part of the P&C Committee s records and shall provide copies of such to Nasdaq. 
 Method of Recovery 
 Subject to applicable law, the Company may seek to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation by any means or combination of means as the P&C Committee, in its sole discretion, determines to be necessary, appropriate or desirable, including requiring a Covered Person to repay such amount to the 
 COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY 
 ADOPTION DATE AUGUST 1, 2023 
 PAGE 1
