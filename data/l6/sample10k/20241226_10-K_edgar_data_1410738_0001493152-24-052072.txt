1. Business. 

The
Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc. and changed its name to
VOIP MDU.com in 2004 and subsequently to VoIP-Pal.Com Inc. in 2006. Since March 2004, the Company has been in the development stage of
becoming a Voice-over-Internet Protocol VoIP re-seller, a provider of a proprietary transactional billing platform tailored
to the points and air mile business, and a provider of anti-virus applications for smartphones. 

In
2013, Voip-Pal acquired Digifonica International (DIL) Limited Digifonica ), to fund and co-develop Digifonica s
patent suite. Digifonica had been founded in 2003 with the vision that the internet would be the future of all forms of telecommunications
- a team of top twenty engineers with expertise in Linux and Internet telephony developed and wrote a software suite with applications
that provided solutions for several core areas of internet connectivity. In order to properly test the applications, Digifonica built
and operated three production nodes in Vancouver, Canada (Peer 1), London, UK (Teliasonera), and Denmark. Upon successfully developing
the technology, Digifonica filed for patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ). 

The
Digifonica patents formed the basis for Voip-Pal s current intellectual property, now a worldwide portfolio of issued and pending
patents primarily designed for the broadband VoIP market. 

The
Issuer s primary and secondary SIC Codes are 4813 and 4899. 

The
Issuer s fiscal year end date is September 30. 

Principal
Products or Services 

VoIP-PAL
owns a worldwide portfolio of issued patents covering numerous inventions, including, but not limited to the following technology areas: 

1.

4. 
 mobile
 gateways; 

5. 
 uninterrupted
 transmission during endpoint changes; and 

6. 
 metering
 and billing, including the reselling of white label telecommunication services. 

VoIP-PAL
continues to have some patent applications pending. 

VoIP-Pal
is actively pursuing patent infringement lawsuits in Waco, Texas, against several Fortune 500 companies, alleging that these companies
are utilizing its patented technologies without authorization. Additionally, VoIP-Pal is engaged in two antitrust lawsuits: one filed
directly by VoIP-Pal and another as part of a class action, with VoIP-Pal as a lead plaintiff, against several Fortune 500 companies.
Both lawsuits allege antitrust violations related to practices VoIP-Pal views as restrictive to fair competition in the telecommunications
industry.

voice over IP (VoIP) system. The 805 Patent could apply, for example, when a routing request message is received and the contents
of an emergency call identifier field of a profile match the callee identifier. In this example, if the caller identifier is not associated
with a pre-associated identifier, a temporary identifier is associated with the caller. When the emergency call flag is active, for example,
a routing message establishes a route between the caller and an emergency response center, the routing message including an emergency
response center identifier from a profile associated with the caller and the DID identifier associated with the caller. 

4.2
U.S. Patent No. 9,565,307 , issued February 7, 2017, relates to, among other things, routing emergency communications. The 307
Patent could apply, for example, when a routing request includes the caller identifier and the callee identifier, and where the caller
identifier identifies a profile associated with the caller that includes an emergency call identifier (e.g., 911 and an
emergency response center identifier. In this example, when the callee identifier matches the emergency call identifier, a routing message
establishes the call, the routing message having a first portion including the emergency response center identifier and a second portion,
which portion may include either a temporary or pre-assigned identifier associated with the caller, for example. 

4.3
Canadian Patent No. 2,681,984, issued April 2, 2019 also relates to routing emergency communications.

We

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We
are an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS
Act and, as such, have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for future filings. 

In
April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act JOBS Act was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other
things: 

- 
 Exemptions
 for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and
 provides a new form of financing to small companies; 

- 
 Amendments
 to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record
 holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; 

- 
 Relaxation
 of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings; 

- 
 Adoption
 of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding 50 million; and 

- 
 Exemption
 from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to 1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted
 by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation
 or offering requirements. 

7 

In
general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering IPO of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than 1 billion of total annual gross revenues
during its last completed fiscal year. We will retain emerging growth company status until the earliest of: 

(i) 
 the
 completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of 1 billion or more, 

(ii) 
 the
 completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company s IPO; 

(iii) 
 the
 company s issuance of more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or 

(iv) 
 the
 company becoming a larger accelerated filer as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

The
JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions
that impact the Company are discussed below. 

Financial
Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows: 

(i) 
 audited
 financial statements required for only two fiscal years (provided that smaller reporting companies such as the Company
 are only required to provide two years of financial statements); 

(ii) 
 selected
 financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited (provided that smaller reporting companies such
 as the Company are not required to provide selected financial data as required by Item 301 of Regulation S-K); and 

(iii) 
 executive
 compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies 

However,
the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide
certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting
company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs to include audited financial
statements for its two most current fiscal years with no required tabular disclosure of contractual obligations. 

The
JOBS Act also exempts the Company s independent registered public accounting firm from having to comply with any rules adopted
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB after the date of the JOBS Act s enactment, except as otherwise
required by SEC rule. 

The
JOBS Act further exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of
the Company s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit. 

Internal
Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company s independent registered public
accounting firm to file a report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company
is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Section 102(a)
of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in 14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to hold shareholder
votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes. 

Other
Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors
that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior
to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer
about an emerging growth company regardless of whether such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision.
In addition, the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers
and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of research reports on the emerging growth company s 
IPOs. 

Section
106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments thereto are publicly filed at least 21
days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow emerging growth companies to explore the IPO option
without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration
statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow. 

Election
to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required
to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard. 

The
JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to
non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition
period. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging
growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult
or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used. 

For
so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions
from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies 
as described above. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on some or all of
these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for
our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. If we avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements,
as is currently our plan, our reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and
may result in less investor confidence.

Non-Patent
Litigation 

The
Company is party to non-patent litigation cases as follows: 

Locksmith
Financial Corporation, Inc. et al. (Plaintiff(s)) v VoIP-Pal.com Inc. et al (Defendant(s)) (Case No A-20-807745-C) filed in Clark County
District Court. 

On
January 1, 2020, the Plaintiffs filed suit in Nevada District Court claiming that they were owed 95,832,000 Voip-Pal common shares from
a previous case involving the Plaintiff and the Defendant that had been through a jury trial in 2019, in which the jury had made an award
to the Plaintiff that was monetary only, and did not include said shares - following the jury s decision in the 2019 trial, the
Plaintiff accepted the award and waived their right to appeal. Voip-Pal vigorously disputed the Plaintiff s 2020 claims on the
basis of claim preclusion (the 2020 claims were addressed in the previous action in 2019 and are now precluded); that Plaintiffs 
claims are untimely, and that the Plaintiffs no longer have standing to bring their claims. 

During
the year ended September 30, 2022, the Court entered a judgment in favor of VoIP-Pal.com Inc and co-defendants, dismissing the 2020 case.
The Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Nevada Supreme Court. 

During
the year ended September 30, 2023, following a hearing of the appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled to reverse the lower court s
judgment and remanded the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. The Defendants (Voip-Pal et al) filed a motion to the
Supreme Court for reconsideration, however that motion was denied, and a trial date was set for November 28, 2023. 

During
the year ended September 30, 2024, on November 30, 2023, after the completion of trial, the Eighth Judicial District Court for the
State of Nevada rendered its decision in favor of VoIP-Pal upon all claims in the case, ruling that the Plaintiffs had not met their
burden of proof with respect to any of its claims against VoIP-Pal et al, awarding no damages to Locksmith and specifically ruling
that Locksmith take nothing as a result of the litigation. 

During
the year ended September 30, 2024, on August 20, 2024, and then amended on September 10, 2024, the Company reached a settlement and
release agreement with the Plaintiff. Pursuant to the settlement and release agreement, the Company agreed to issue 30,000,000
restricted common shares of the Company, with a value of 351,000, and in consideration of the agreement, the Plaintiff shall file a
voluntary dismissal of its appeal immediately upon delivery of the certificates. Subsequent to the year end, on October 1, 2024, a
share certificate of 30,000,000 was issued to the Plaintiff. The case is closed.

PART
II 

Item
5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 

Market 

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB with the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol VPLM . The OTCQB is an inter- dealer
quotation and trading system where market makers apply to quote securities. Accordingly, the OTCQB is not considered a market, and there
is, therefore, no public market for our Common Stock. 

Holders 

We
had approximately 576 holders of record of our common stock as of September 30, 2024 according to the books of our transfer agent. The
number of our stockholders of record excludes any estimate by us of the number of beneficial owners of shares held in street name, the
accuracy of which cannot be guaranteed. 

Dividends 

We
have not declared a dividend on our common stock, and we do not anticipate the payment of dividends in the near future as we intend to
reinvest our profits to grow our business. There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that restrict us from
declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution
of the dividend: 

we
 would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or 

our
 total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities, plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders
 who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution.

CORPORATE
HISTORY, OVERVIEW AND PRINCIPAL BUSINESS 

VoIP-PAL.com
Inc. (the Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc.
and changed its name to VOIP MDI.com in 2004 and subsequently to Voip-Pal.Com Inc. in 2006. Since March 2004, the Company has been in
the development stage of becoming a Voice-over-Internet Protocol VoIP re-seller, a provider of a proprietary transactional
billing platform tailored to the points and air mile business, and a provider of anti-virus applications for smartphones. All business
activities prior to March 2004 have been abandoned and written off to deficit. 

In
2013, the Company acquired Digifonica International (DIL) Limited Digifonica ), to fund and co-develop Digifonica s
patent suite. Digifonica had been founded in 2003 with the vision that the internet would be the future of all forms of telecommunications
- a team of top twenty engineers with expertise in Linux and Internet telephony developed and wrote a software suite with applications
that provided solutions for several core areas of internet connectivity. In order to properly test the applications, Digifonica built
and operated three production nodes in Vancouver, Canada (Peer 1), London, UK (Teliasonera), and Denmark. Upon successfully developing
the technology, Digifonica filed for patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ). 

The
Digifonica patents formed the basis for the Company s current intellectual property, now a worldwide portfolio of twenty-six issued
and pending patents primarily designed for the broadband VoIP market. 

The
Company s intellectual property value is derived from its issued and pending patents. The inventions described in these patents,
among other things, provide the means to integrate VoIP services with legacy telecommunications systems such as the public switched telephone
network (PSTN) to create a seamless service using either legacy telephone numbers or IP addresses, and enhance the performance and value
of VoIP implementations worldwide. 

VoIP
has been and continues to be a green field for innovation that has spawned numerous inventions, greatly benefitting consumers large and
small across the globe. VoIP is used in many places and by every modern telephony system vendor, network supplier, and retail and wholesale
carrier. 

Results
of Operations 

The
Company s operating costs consist of expenses incurred to monetizing, selling and licensing its VoIP patents. Other operating costs
include expenses for legal, accounting and other professional fees, financing costs, and other general and administrative expenses.

The
Company primarily finances its operations from cash received through the private placement of its common stock, settling outstanding
debts, and the exercise of warrants from investors. There can be no assurance that capital will be available as necessary to meet continued
developments and operating costs or, if the capital is available, that it will be on terms acceptable to the Company. As at September
30, 2024, the Company had cash of 2,369,413 and current liabilities of 300,782 and incurred net loss of 10,172,194 during the year

Sheet Arrangements 

Performance
Bonus Payable 

In
2016, the board of directors authorized the Company to provide a performance bonus (the Performance Bonus of up to 3 
of the capital stock of the Company by way of the issuance of Common shares from its treasury to an as yet undetermined group of related
and non-related parties upon the occurrence of a bonusable event, defined as the successful completion of a sale of the Company or substantially
all its assets, or a major licensing transaction. In order to provide maximum flexibility to the Company with respect to determining
the level of Performance Bonus payable, and who may qualify to receive a pro-rata share of such a Performance Bonus, the Company authorized
full discretion to the Board in making such determinations. 

In
2019, the board of directors authorized the increase of the Performance Bonus to up to 10 of the capital stock of the Company. Concurrently,
the directors authorized 66.67 of the Performance Bonus to be issued in an advance payment of an aggregate 127,000,000 Common shares Bonus Shares to a group of related and non-related parties, which included members of management, a director and several
consultants. 60,000,000 of the Bonus Shares are restricted from trading under Rule 144 and subject to voluntary lock-up agreements under
which they cannot be traded, pledged, hypothecated, transferred or sold by the holders until such time as the Company has met the requirements
of the bonusable event as described above. 

As
at September 30, 2024, no bonusable event had occurred and there was no Performance Bonus payable.

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Voip-Pal.com
Inc. (the Company ), as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive
loss, consolidated statements of stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related
notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Voip-Pal.com Inc. as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is in
various stages of product development and continues to incur losses and, as at September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of 103,357,782
(September 30, 2023 - 93,185,588). These material uncertainties raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatements
of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2015.

reportable segment being the acquisition
and development of VoIP-related intellectual property including patents and technology. All intangible assets are located in the United
States of America. 

In
December 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of Digifonica (International) Limited, a private company controlled by the CEO of
the Company, whose assets included several patents and technology developed for the VoIP market. 

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is in various stages of product development and continues to incur
losses and, as at September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of (September 30, 2023 - ). The ability of the
Company to continue operations as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional working capital, settling outstanding debts and
the exercise of warrants from investors. These material uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. Should the going concern assumption not continue to be appropriate, further adjustments to carrying values of assets
and liabilities may be required. There can be no assurance that capital will be available as necessary to meet these continued developments
and operating costs or, if the capital is available, that it will be on terms acceptable to the Company. The issuances of additional
stock by the Company may result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of its current shareholders. Obtaining commercial loans,
assuming those loans would be available, will increase the Company s liabilities and future cash commitments. If the Company is
unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable, its business and future success may be adversely affected. 

Additionally,
as the Company s stated objective is to monetize its patent suite through the licensing or sale of its intellectual property IP ),
the Company being forced to litigate or to defend its IP claims through litigation casts substantial doubt on its future to continue
as a going concern. IP litigation is generally a costly process, and in the absence of revenue the Company must raise capital to continue
its own defense and to validate its claims in the event of a failure to defend its patent claims, either because of lack of funding,
a court ruling against the Company or because of a protracted litigation process, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to raise additional capital to pay for an appeals process or a lengthy trial. The outcome of any litigation process may have a significant
adverse effect on the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

Lawful Intercept, routing, billing and rating, mobile gateway, advanced interoperability solutions, intercepting voice over IP communications,
and uninterrupted transmission of internet protocol transmissions during endpoint changes. 

The
SPA included an anti-dilution clause (the Anti-Dilution Clause that required the Company to maintain the Seller s
percentage ownership of the Company at by issuing the Seller a proportionate number of common shares of any future issuance of the
Company s common shares. Shares issued pursuant to the Anti-Dilution Clause were recorded as a share issuance cost within the Additional
Paid-in Capital account (Notes 8 and 10). 

During
the year ended September 30, 2021, on April 12, 2021, the SPA was amended to provide that: a) from its inception until March 31, 2021,
the Company would issue warrants to purchase common shares of the Company in an equivalent amount to and instead of the required shares
being issued pursuant to the Anti-Dilution Clause; and b) the Anti-Dilution Clause would be null and void from April 1, 2021 forward.
As a result of this amendment, the Seller returned common shares to the treasury of the Company and relinquished his right
to receive an additional common shares in exchange for warrants to purchase common shares at a price of 
for a period of ten years from the date of issue. 

During
the year ended September 30, 2023, on April 23, 2023, the SPA was further amended to: a) retroactively reinstate the Anti-Dilution Clause
that had been nullified by the amendments made to the STA in April 2021 so that the Company is now required to issue warrants to purchase
common shares of the Company in an equivalent amount to and instead of the required shares being issued pursuant to the original Anti-Dilution
Clause; and b) require the Company to issue preferred shares with super-voting rights in a sufficient amount in order for the Seller
to maintain his voting rights in the Company while his warrants issued pursuant to the original and reinstated Anti-Dilution Clause
remain unexercised 2023 Amendments ). Each of the warrant issuance and the preferred share issuance required under the
2023 Amendments are to occur at the close of each quarterly reporting period. As a result of the 2023 Amendments, the Seller was issued
 share purchase warrants and series A preferred shares on June 30, 2023. Shares and warrants issued pursuant to the
Anti-Dilution Clause are recorded as a share issuance cost within the additional paid-in capital account. 

Pursuant
to the 2023 Amendments, during the year ended September 30, 2024, the Seller was issued share purchase warrants and

District Court. 

On

a previous case involving the Plaintiff and the Defendant that had been through a jury trial in 2019, in which the jury had made an award
to the Plaintiff that was monetary only, and did not include said shares - following the jury s decision in the 2019 trial, the
Plaintiff accepted the award and waived their right to appeal. Voip-Pal vigorously disputed the Plaintiff s 2020 claims on the
basis of claim preclusion (the 2020 claims were addressed in the previous action in 2019 and are now precluded); that Plaintiffs 
claims are untimely, and that the Plaintiffs no longer have standing to bring their claims.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

At
the end of the period covered by this Report for the year ended September 30, 2024, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision
of, and with the participation of, the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer CEO and
Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the Company s
CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurance that the information
required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting ICFR ), as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act. The Company s ICFR is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP. The Company s
ICFR includes policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and disposition of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements. 

Because
of their inherent limitations, ICFR can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Furthermore, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Change
in ICFR 

In
connection with the audit of our financials for the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company s auditors noted material weaknesses
and made certain recommendations to management regarding material weaknesses related to 1. lack of segregation of duties, 2. lack of
an independent audit committee; 3. insufficient number of independent directors; 4. insufficient period-end balance sheet reconciliations
and review of journal entries; 5. no formal codes of conduct (the 2023 Material Weaknesses ). 

In
connection with the 2023 Material Weaknesses, the Company allocated resources to its remediation plan and implemented additional controls
during the year ended September 30, 2024 which included the following: 

1) 
 Hired
 a new CFO who is not a board member to enable us to have adequate segregation of duties within our internal control system. 

2) 
 Established
 an audit committee comprised solely of independent directors. 

3) 
 Established
 our board of directors which consists of a majority of independent directors. 

4) 
 Sufficient
 period-end balance sheet reconciliations and review of journal entries. With the engagement of a third-party accountant to perform
 the bookkeeping for the Company, the newly hired CFO and a financial advisor can perform period-end balance sheet reconciliations
 and review of journal entries on a timely basis. 

As
of September 30, 2024, management believes the 2023 Material Weaknesses relating to its lack of segregation of duties, lack of an independent
audit committee, insufficient number of independent directors, and insufficient period-end balance sheet reconciliations and review of
journal entries have been fully remediated. However, other than as described in the preceding paragraph, there were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Evaluation
of Effectiveness of ICFR 

The
Company s management (with the participation of the CEO and the CFO) conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. The
COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company s internal control system, including (i) the control environment,
(ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring. In management s assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) as required by Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(c), our management concluded as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that our internal
control over financial reporting has not been effective. 

As
defined by Auditing Standard No. 5, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of
Financial Statements and Related Independence Rule and Conforming Amendments, established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board PCAOB ), a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results more than a remote likelihood
that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

In
connection with the assessment described above, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses
as of September 30, 2024: 

- No
 formal codes of conduct. 
 - Lack
 of proper controls over financial reporting of unusual and complex transactions. 

Based on this evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, relating to no formal codes of conduct and the lack of
proper controls over financial reporting of unusual and complex transactions. 

Remediation 

In
response to the material weakness described above, the Company will be implementing a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses
which will include measures to enhance its documentation of a formal code of conduct. The management is in progress to establish a regular
review process with clearly defined roles and responsibilities and implement reconciliation tools to ensure timely and accurate comparisons
of financial data. Management will also implement additional controls over financial reporting of unusual and complex transactions including
but not limited to engaging financial reporting consultants to evaluate the accounting implications of complex issues. 

The
Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting on an
ongoing basis and if the remediation plan is not sufficient to eliminate the material weakness, the Company will consider what additional
actions would be required.
