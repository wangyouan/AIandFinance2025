PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
 General 
 ABM Industries Incorporated, which operates through its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as ABM, we, us, our, or the Company ), is a leading provider of integrated facility, infrastructure, and mobility solutions with a mission to make a difference, every person, every day . Our history dates back to 1909, when American Building Maintenance Company began as a window washing company in San Francisco with one employee. In 1985, we were incorporated in Delaware under the name American Building Maintenance Industries, Inc., as the successor to the business originally founded in 1909. In 1994, we changed our name to ABM Industries Incorporated. Since that time, we have grown into a multi-segment facility solutions company, primarily through strategic acquisitions and new service offerings, increasing our revenue to more than 8.0 billion. 
 
 The acquisitions of OneSource and Linc Group in the early 2000s established ABM as a leader in the commercial janitorial market and also enhanced our ability to be a full-service facility solutions provider with new service offerings, including lighting, mechanical, and electrical technical solutions. With demand increasing for industry-specific service providers, the acquisition of Air Serv established Aviation as our first industry group. In recent years, we have strategically acquired companies in the United Kingdom UK and the Republic of Ireland Ireland ), which expanded our janitorial and technical solutions businesses overseas. 
 In 2015, we began a comprehensive transformational initiative 2020 Vision to drive long-term, profitable growth through an industry-based, go-to-market approach. Through this initiative, we centralized key functional areas and industry groups, strengthened our sales capabilities, and initiated investments in service delivery tools and processes to help support standard operating practices that we believe remain foundational to our long-term success. 
 As part of the transformation initiative, we also evaluated all of our service offerings and sold our Security and Government Services businesses, which did not align with our long-term focus on specialized industry groups. 
 In 2017, we acquired GCA Services Group GCA ), a provider of integrated facility services to educational institutions and commercial facilities, for approximately 1.3 billion, representing the largest acquisition in ABM history. The acquisition accelerated the Company s position as a leading facility solutions provider in the education market. 
 2 

In 2021, we acquired Crown Building Maintenance Co. and Crown Energy Services, Inc. (collectively, Able ), a leading facilities services company headquartered in San Francisco, California, with the goal to provide additional scaling to the Company s core businesses and key geographies and bolstering ABM s janitorial and facilities services service lines. In addition, the acquisition of Able further expanded ABM s sustainability and energy efficiency offerings amid growing demand for environmentally responsible solutions. 
 In 2022, we acquired RavenVolt, Inc. RavenVolt ), a leading nationwide provider of advanced turn-key microgrid systems utilized by diversified commercial and industrial customers, national retailers, utilities, and municipalities. A complementary extension of ABM s Technical Solutions service offerings, the addition of RavenVolt enhanced ABM s position as a market leader in electric vehicle EV charging infrastructure, power, and bundled energy solutions. 
 In 2022, we acquired Momentum Support Momentum ), a leading independent provider of facility services, primarily janitorial, across Ireland and Northern Ireland. The addition of Momentum provided greater access to Momentum s blue-chip customer base as well as an opportunity to cross sell ABM services to existing U.S.- and UK-based clients who also have an operational footprint in Ireland and Northern Ireland. 
 In 2024, we acquired Quality Uptime Services, Inc. Quality Uptime ), an independent uninterrupted power supply system UPS maintenance company providing customized preventive and emergency service programs for mission-critical data centers and other facilities across the United States. With the addition of Quality Uptime, we will offer comprehensive and complementary critical infrastructure solutions for data centers and similar crucial facilities, including electrical testing, electrical switchgear maintenance, breaker testing, UPS service and maintenance, and battery and power distribution unit service and maintenance. 
 The above acquisitions and divestitures we ve made since 2015 largely reflect strategies first introduced in our 2020 Vision initiative and also strategies included in our follow-on launched strategic plan called ELEVATE, which was introduced in 2021 and is described below. 
 As a result of these strategic initiatives and investments, we have strengthened our ability to offer janitorial, engineering, parking and eMobility, infrastructure, electrical, lighting and energy solutions, HVAC and mechanical services, landscaping and turf services, and mission critical solutions across aviation, education, manufacturing and distribution, and commercial business industries, on a standalone basis or in combination, and have positioned ourselves as a leading integrated facilities management company. 
 Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years are to our fiscal year, which ends on October 31. 
 Forward-Looking Strategic Plan 
 Leveraging the various accomplishments achieved through 2020 Vision , the Company embarked on the next step of its journey in 2021 with a multiyear strategic plan called ELEVATE . The ELEVATE strategy is designed to strengthen our industry leadership position through end-market repositioning and building on our core services, which we expect together will drive significant long-term value for our stakeholders. 
 We will continue to make significant investments over the life of the program, which are expected to total 200 - 215 million, and we will continue to implement various measures with the aim to ELEVATE : 
 the client experience, by serving as a trusted advisor who can provide innovative multiservice solutions and consistent service delivery; 
 
 the team member experience, by investing in workforce management, training, developing the next generation of ABM leaders, and building on our inclusive culture; and 
 
 our use of technology and data to power client and employee experiences with cutting-edge data and analytics, processes, and tools that will fundamentally change how we operate our business.

Contract Types 
 We generate revenues under several types of contracts, as explained below. Generally, the type of contract is determined by the nature of the services. Although many of our service agreements are cancelable on short notice, we have historically had a high rate of client retention and expect to continue maintaining long-term relationships with our clients. See Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the contract types that are most common in each of our service lines. 
 Contract Type Description Monthly Fixed-Price These arrangements are contracts in which the client agrees to pay a fixed fee every month over a specified contract term. Square-Foot Square-foot arrangements are contracts in which the client agrees to pay a fixed fee every month based on the actual square footage serviced over a specified contract term. Cost-Plus These arrangements are contracts in which the clients reimburse us for the agreed-upon amount of wages and benefits, payroll taxes, insurance charges, and other expenses associated with the contracted work, plus a profit margin. Work Orders Work orders generally consist of supplemental services requested by clients outside of the standard service specification and include cleanup after tenant moves, construction cleanup, flood cleanup, snow removal, and high touchpoint disinfecting services. Transaction-Price These are arrangements in which customers are billed a fixed price for each transaction performed on a monthly basis (e.g., wheelchair passengers served or airplane cabins cleaned). Hourly In hourly arrangements, the client is billed a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour provided. Management Reimbursement Under these parking arrangements, we manage a parking facility for a management fee and pass through the revenue and expenses associated with the facility to the owner. Leased Location Under these parking arrangements, we pay a fixed amount of rent plus a percentage of revenues derived from monthly and transient parkers to the property owner. We retain all revenues received and are responsible for most operating expenses incurred. Allowance Under these parking arrangements, we are paid a fixed amount or hourly fee to provide parking services, and we are responsible for certain operating expenses, as specified in the contract. Energy Savings Contracts and Fixed-Price Repair and Refurbishment Under these arrangements, we agree to develop, design, engineer, and construct various types of energy saving projects. Additionally, as part of bundled energy solutions arrangements, we guarantee the project will satisfy agreed-upon performance standards. The client agrees to pay us based on a predetermined contractual milestone schedule. 
 Franchise We franchise certain engineering services through individual and area franchises under the Linc Service and TEGG brands, which are part of ABM Technical Solutions. Microgrid and Uninterrupted Power Supply Systems Installation 
 Under these arrangements, we provide electrical contracting services for energy-related products such as the installation of solar solutions, battery storage, distributed generation, UPS service and maintenance, battery and power distribution unit service and maintenance, and other specialized electric trades. The client agrees to pay us based on a predetermined contractual milestone schedule.

Segment and Geographic Financial Information 
 Our current reportable segments consist of Business Industry B I ), Manufacturing Distribution M D ), Education, Aviation, and Technical Solutions. For segment and geographic financial information, see Note 17, Segment and Geographic Information, in the Notes to consolidated financial statements. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND DESCRIPTIONS 
 B I, our largest reportable segment, encompasses janitorial, facilities engineering, and parking services for commercial real estate properties (including corporate offices for high-tech clients), sports and entertainment venues, and traditional hospitals and non-acute healthcare facilities. B I also provides vehicle maintenance and other services to rental car providers. We typically provide these services pursuant to monthly fixed-price, square-foot, cost-plus, and parking arrangements (i.e., management reimbursement, leased location, or allowance) that are obtained through a competitive bid process as well as pursuant to work orders. 
 
 M D provides integrated facility services, engineering, janitorial, and other specialized services to a variety of manufacturing, distribution, and data center facilities. We typically provide these services pursuant to monthly fixed-price, square-foot, and cost-plus, that are obtained through a competitive bid process as well as pursuant to work orders. One client accounted for approximately 31 of revenues for this segment in 2024. 
 
 Education delivers janitorial, custodial, landscaping and grounds, facilities engineering, and parking services for public school districts, private schools, colleges, and universities. These services are typically provided pursuant to monthly fixed-price, square-foot, and cost-plus arrangements that are obtained through either a competitive bid process or re-bid upon renewal as well as pursuant to work orders. 
 
 Aviation supports airlines and airports with services ranging from parking and janitorial to passenger assistance, catering logistics, air cabin maintenance, and transportation. We typically provide services to clients in this segment under master services agreements. These agreements are typically re-bid upon renewal and are generally structured as monthly fixed-price, square-foot, cost-plus, parking, transaction-price, and hourly arrangements . Two clients accounted for approximately 26 of revenues for this segment in 2024. 
 
 Technical Solutions specializes in facility infrastructure, mechanical and electrical services, EV power design, installation and maintenance, microgrid systems design, installation and maintenance, including uninterrupted power supply system and power distribution units. These services can also be leveraged for cross-selling across all of our industry groups, both domestically and internationally. Contracts for this segment are generally structured as electrical contracting services for energy related products such as the installation of solar solutions, battery storage, distributed generation, and other specialized electric trade. One client accounted for approximately 22 of revenues for this segment in 2024. 

5 

Service Marks, Trademarks, and Trade Names 
 We hold various service marks, trademarks, and/or trade names, such as ABM, ABM Building Value, ABM GreenCare, ABM EnhancedClean, ABM EnhancedFacility, Linc Service, TEGG, ABM Connect, ABMVantage, and RavenVolt, which we deem important to our marketing activities, to our business, and, in some cases, to the franchising activities conducted by our Technical Solutions segment. 
 Dependence on Significant Client 
 No single client accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues during 2024, 2023, or 2022. 
 Competition 
 We believe that each aspect of our business is highly competitive and that such competition is based primarily on price, quality of service, efficiency, and productivity enhancements, adapting to changing workplace conditions, and ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes. A majority of our revenue is derived from projects requiring competitive bids; however, an invitation to bid is often conditioned upon prior experience, industry expertise, and financial strength. The low cost of entry in the facility services business results in a very competitive market. We mainly compete with regional and local owner-operated companies that may have more acute vision into local markets and significantly lower labor and overhead costs, providing them with competitive advantages in those regards. We also compete indirectly with companies that can perform for themselves one or more of the services we provide. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing activities include digital engagement and direct interactions with prospective and existing clients, pricing, proposal management, and customer relationship management by dedicated business development teams, operations personnel, and management. These activities are executed by branch and regional sales, marketing, and operations teams assigned to our industry groups and are supported by centralized sales support teams, inside sales teams, and marketing personnel. The sales and marketing teams acquire, nurture, and manage leads through the sales buying process, as well as train personnel on product offerings, sales tools, and proposal systems, all governed by standard operating procedures. 
 Macro-Economic Environment in Commercial Real Estate 
 On an ongoing basis, we monitor changes to the macro-economic environment and their potential impacts on demand for our services and on our financial condition. One such monitored change is the strength or softness of the commercial real estate industry, especially multi-tenant and owner-occupied commercial office buildings. The recent softness in that market is primarily attributable to the lingering effects of the Pandemic, especially the normalization of hybrid work, which has resulted in higher office vacancy rates. Given that Class A and high-quality commercial office buildings are a key end market for us, we have experienced modest declines in demand for janitorial services and work orders in these markets. We expect the occupancy rates of Class A and high-quality buildings and back-to office trends to improve throughout 2025. 
 
 Regulatory Environment 
 Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and/or local laws, rules, and regulations regulating among other things, labor, wages, and health and safety matters, as well as laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Historically, the cost of complying with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Corporate Responsibility Strategy and Oversight 
 As a company with over 110 years of history, we understand the importance of embedding and integrating responsible and community-minded business practices into our operations and commit to standards to create value and support the long-term success of our business, shareholders, employees, and clients. 
 Our Board of Directors oversees ABM s corporate responsibility-related risks and priorities with the assistance of its committees. Our Board of Directors receives regular reports from meetings of its Governance Committee, which is responsible for oversight of the Company s corporate governance and overall corporate 
 6 

responsibility-related framework, as well as from meetings of its Stakeholder and Enterprise Risk Committee, which is responsible for oversight of the Company s programs, policies, and practices relating to social and environmental matters that may impact the Company s business and key stakeholders. Additionally, our internal culture, environmental sustainability, and inclusion efforts are led by cross functional teams that include employees across the enterprise, and are aimed to advance our corporate responsibility strategies, and regularly present to the Board of Directors Stakeholder and Enterprise Risk Committee. 
 Since 2011, we have voluntarily published a Corporate Responsibility Report on an annual basis in alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative framework and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board to address our business, our employees, and the environment. More information about our sustainability performance, progress, and goals can be found in the Human Capital section of this report and in the Corporate Responsibility section of the Company s corporate website. 
 Human Capital 
 Given that ABM is a service-oriented business, our employees are the driving force behind our success, and we believe our ability to attract, develop, and retain our employees at all levels of our organization has a direct impact on client satisfaction and our ability to grow the Company. To succeed in a competitive labor market, ABM has developed key recruitment and retention strategies, objectives, and measures that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives, and measures form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the programs, policies, and initiatives described below. 
 Direct labor costs represented 68 of our total revenue for 2024. As of October 31, 2024, we employed approximately 117,000 employees, of whom approximately 49,000, or 42 , were subject to various local collective bargaining agreements. As of October 31, 2024, our frontline employees represented 92 of our total workforce, while staff and management employees represented the other 8 . 
 Our human capital strategy is guided by our values and advanced by our employees. We prioritize doing business in a responsible way and enabling our employees and clients success. The execution of our human capital strategy is overseen at the highest levels of our organization, from our Board of Directors, our Board of Directors Stakeholder and Enterprise Risk Committee, and across our senior management. 
 Business ethics 
 Our Code of Business Conduct drives the application of our core values of respect, integrity, collaboration, innovation, trust, and excellence throughout our operations. Our Code of Business Conduct serves as a critical tool to help all ABM team members to recognize and report unethical conduct, while preserving and nurturing our culture of honesty and accountability. The Company provides comprehensive annual training and certification programs on our Code of Business Conduct for our Board of Directors and all of our staff and management employees. 
 Human resources, hiring, and training 
 With a team of approximately 117,000 employees across the United States, UK, Ireland, and other locations, we have invested in and implemented a variety of systems and tools designed to centralize and standardize hiring and training practices, including regional recruitment strategies, applicant tracking technology, and advanced analytics that provide actionable insights in our HR processes. These efforts are intended to drive ongoing improvement in the attraction, retention, and engagement of our frontline employees, who constitute the majority of our workforce. 
 As we continue to elevate our employee experience and prepare our next generation of internal leaders, we continued to grow our frontline leadership program, which we launched enterprise-wide in 2022. This program is designed to enhance the management and coaching skills of frontline supervisors to improve the employee experience, create an environment for career growth, and increase retention. 
 In 2024, we re-launched our Leadership Academy designed for middle- and senior-level leaders from across the enterprise. The 2024 class participated in the four-month development program, which provided a broader operational understanding of the organization, identified and closed development gaps, and accelerated such employees readiness for future growth as effective leaders. 
 Our online training platform, ABM University, provides our staff and management employees with access to a multitude of training courses, videos, reference material, and other tools. Additionally, our frontline employees 
 7 

receive on-the-job training specific to their role and location to enable us to deliver for our clients in a safe and efficient manner. 
 Compensation and employee benefits 
 In addition, we offer competitive wages and salaries in our served markets, and full-time employees have access to a continuum of health and wellness benefits, including medical, dental, vision, disability, and basic and voluntary life and AD D insurance, 401K employee savings and an employee stock purchase plan, a 24/7 employee assistance program, healthcare flexible spending accounts, telemedicine options, legal support, as well as commuter, fitness, and other discount programs. 
 Labor relations 
 With approximately 49,000 union-represented employees, we are party to more than 300 collective bargaining agreements nationwide, with more than 20 major labor unions. Our collective bargaining agreements include regional multiemployer agreements covering thousands of employees, as well as localized site agreements covering smaller groups. We strive to engage with our labor partners in an atmosphere of mutual respect, and seek to resolve disputes in a fair and equitable manner. 
 Safe working environment 
 ABM s commitment to its employees is evidenced in its approach to risk management and safety. The Company s programs are designed to meet or exceed compliance standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other regulatory bodies and to protect the health and welfare of our employees and our clients. A cornerstone of ABM s comprehensive risk management and safety program is safety awareness to confirm our employees are: 
 
 educated on how to complete tasks safely; 
 trained in hazard identification; 
 made aware of emergency response procedures to immediately address challenges; and 
 proficient in reporting accidents, utilizing applicable procedures to confirm appropriate loss mitigation techniques are implemented should a loss occur. 
 Our Think Safe approach to safety includes establishing a safety mindset from day one of employment. This safety culture is continuously reinforced through daily moments for safety messaging, relevant monthly training topics, and unique programs and materials created for our employees. 
 One of the cornerstones of our ThinkSafe program is designed to help leaders identify workplace hazards and implement changes to prevent accident or injury. In our frontline leader training, participants are guided in creating a culture of safety and provided guidance on practices to support our employees receiving the right care at the right time to expedite their recovery. 
 Culture and inclusion 
 With a widely distributed workforce serving over 20,000 clients across multiple nations and geographic regions, ABM s culture, and the team member experience it supports, plays a vital role in attracting, retaining, and engaging talent. The Company works to develop an increasingly inclusive culture, where individuals from all backgrounds are equally able to contribute and are provided with opportunities to grow in their careers. 
 Guided by ABM s mission and values, the Company s inclusive culture strategy is activated through its Culture Inclusion Council. ABM s President and CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer each serve as executive sponsors of the Council, which provides regular reports to the Board s Stakeholder and Enterprise Risk Committee. 
 Additionally, ABM is an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer in compliance with the requirements of the Executive Order 11246 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 The following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, and/or the trading price of our common stock. The risks described below identify the material risks we face; however, our business could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes (the Financial Statements ). 
 Risks Relating to Our Strategy and Operations 
 Our success depends on our ability to gain profitable business despite competitive market pressures. 
 Each market we provide services for is highly competitive and such competition is based primarily on price, quality of service, reputation, and ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes. A majority of our revenue is derived from services that require competitive bids from multiple suppliers. The low barrier of entry in the facility services business results in a very competitive market. We compete mainly with regional and local owner-operated companies that may have more insight into local market dynamics and significantly lower operating costs, which could provide them with a competitive advantage in those regards. We also compete indirectly with companies that can perform for themselves one or more of the services we provide. Further, if we are unable to respond adequately to market shifts and changing technology, we may lose existing clients and fail to win future business opportunities. A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures or failure in our ability to increase prices as costs rise could reduce margins and materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
 
 Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover, and labor cost increases. 
 We employ approximately 117,000 persons, and our operations depend on the services of a large and diverse workforce. We must attract, train, and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including changes in the unemployment rate, changes in immigration policy, regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and competition we face from other companies for similarly skilled employees. Meaningful labor shortages, inflationary pressures on wages, and/or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime incurred and/or increased usage of temporary labor to meet the demands of our customers, as well as increased wage rates to attract and retain employees. Further, many of our contracts provide that our clients pay certain costs at specified rates, such as insurance, healthcare costs, salary and salary-related expenses, and other costs. If actual costs exceed the rates specified in the contracts, our profitability may be negatively impacted. There is no assurance that in the future we will be able to attract or retain qualified employees or effectively manage labor and benefit costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management we need to support our business. 
 Our future performance depends on the continuing efforts and contributions of our senior management and on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Unplanned turnover in senior management or inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring, and integrating qualified management employees may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 Investments in and changes to our businesses, operating structure, or personnel relating to our ELEVATE strategy, including the implementation of strategic transformations, enhanced business processes, and technology initiatives, may not have the desired effects on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We have made significant investments and expect to make additional investments in various initiatives intended to drive long-term profitable growth and increase operational efficiency. These investments in and changes to our business systems and processes may not create the growth, operational efficiencies, competitive advantage, 
 10 

or cost benefits that we expect and could result in unanticipated consequences, including disruptions to our back-office operations and service delivery. Moreover, the execution and/or benefits of our ELEVATE strategy may not be realized on the expected timeline and/or may result in expenses in excess of what is currently forecast, which could negatively affect our financial condition. 
 Our ability to preserve long-term client relationships is essential to our continued success. 
 We depend to a large extent on our relationships with clients and our reputation for quality integrated facility solutions. Maintaining our existing client relationships, particularly with our largest clients, is an important factor contributing to our business success. We primarily provide services pursuant to agreements that are cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice. As we generally incur higher initial costs on new contracts until the labor management and facilities operations normalize, our business associated with long-term client relationships is generally more profitable than short-term client relationships. If we lose a significant number of long-term clients and/or all or a portion of the services for our larger clients, our financial results could be negatively impacted. 
 Our use of subcontractors or joint venture partners to perform work under customer contracts exposes us to liability and financial risk. 
 We depend on subcontractors or other parties, such as joint venture partners, to perform work in situations in which we are not able to self-perform the work involved. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts or joint venture relationships where we do not have direct control over the performing party. We may be exposed to liability whenever one or more of our subcontractors or joint venture partners, for whatever reason, fails to perform or allegedly negligently performs the agreed-upon services. Although we have controls and programs in place to monitor the work of our subcontractors and our joint venture partners, there can be no assurance that these controls or programs will have the desired effect, and we may incur significant liability as a result of the actions or inactions of one or more of our subcontractors or joint venture partners. 
 Our international business involves risks different from those we face in the United States that could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have business operations in jurisdictions outside of the United States, most significantly in the UK and Ireland. Our international operations are subject to risks that are different from those we face in the United States and subject us to complex and frequently changing laws and regulations, including differing labor laws and regulations relating to the protection of certain information that we collect and maintain about our employees, clients, and other third parties. Among these laws is the UK Modern Slavery Act, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 (Ireland), the UK Bribery Act, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 (Ireland), and the UK and European Union General Data Protection Regulations (the GDPR ). The failure to comply with these laws or regulations could subject us to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, or fines in one or more jurisdictions. 
 In addition, when we participate in joint ventures that operate outside of the United States where we are not a controlling party, we may have limited control over the joint venture. Any improper actions by our joint venture employees, partners, or agents, including, but not limited to, failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and/or laws relating to human trafficking, could result in civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties, or other consequences, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position as well as on our reputation and ability to conduct business. 
 Additionally, the operating results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, and those translations are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. There can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Relating to Market and Economic Conditions 
 Decreases in commercial office space utilization due to hybrid work models and increases in office vacancy rates could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 A key part of our business involves providing janitorial, facilities engineering, and parking services for commercial office building properties. Across the United States, hybrid work models remain prevalent and commercial office vacancy levels remain elevated, compared to pre-pandemic levels. Reduced office occupancies and any further deterioration in vacancy levels would likely decrease the demand for our facility services as well as 
 11 

the demand for highly profitable supplemental services work orders requested by our clients outside the scope of our standard service specifications. As new tenants occupy vacant office spaces, there may be delays and additional expenses incurred in securing client relationships with such new tenants. These factors could adversely affect our revenues and financial results. 
 Negative changes in general economic conditions, such as recessionary pressures, high interest rates, durable and non-durable goods pricing, changes in energy prices, or changes in consumer goods pricing could reduce the demand for our services and, as a result, reduce our revenue and earnings and adversely affect our financial condition. 
 Slowing economic activity or other negative changes in global, national, and local economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business. These adverse economic conditions could cause a decline in our clients demand for our services and/or in scope of work, including work orders and our clients ability to pay for such services, or attempts by our clients to defer payments owed to us. Further, potential declines in economic conditions could result in depressed prices for our services, which could affect our financial condition. 
 We offer a portfolio of capital projects, which are designed to reduce a client s overall consumption of energy, such as electricity and natural gas. Downward fluctuations in energy prices, and/or elevated interest rates, may reduce client demand for such projects. Additionally, we depend, in part, on federal and state legislation and policies that support energy efficiency projects. If current legislation or policies are amended, eliminated, or not extended beyond their current expiration dates, or if funding for energy incentives is reduced or delayed, it could also adversely affect our ability to obtain new capital projects. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Risks Relating to Information Technology and Cybersecurity 
 We may experience breaches of, or disruptions to, our information technology systems or those of our third-party providers or clients, or other compromises of our data that could adversely affect our business. 
 Our information technology systems and those of our third-party providers or clients could be the target of cyberattacks, ransomware attacks, hacking, unauthorized access, phishing, computer viruses, malware, or other intrusions, which could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation, such as theft of intellectual property or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary, or personal information. We maintain confidential, proprietary, and personal information in our information technology systems and in systems of third-party providers relating to our current, former, and prospective employees, clients, and other third parties. We have experienced certain data and security breaches in the past and could experience future data or security breaches stemming from the intentional or negligent acts of our employees or other third parties. Furthermore, while we continue to devote significant resources to monitoring and updating our systems and implementing information security measures to protect our systems, there can be no assurance that the controls and procedures we have in place will be sufficient to protect us from future security breaches. Emerging artificial intelligence technologies may intensify these cybersecurity risks. As cyber threats are continually evolving, our controls and procedures may become inadequate, and we may be required to devote additional resources to modifying or enhancing our systems in the future. We may also be required to expend resources to remediate cyber-related incidents or to enhance and strengthen our cybersecurity. 
 Any such disruptions to our information technology systems, breaches or compromises of data, and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, negative publicity, litigation, violations of privacy and other laws, or business delays that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we believe that along with the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, further increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy. Compliance with this rapidly expanding area of law will require significant management and financial resources, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses if we are not in compliance. This expanding area of law may also lead to potentially significant additional claims, including class action claims, being alleged against us. 
 Our ongoing implementation of new enterprise resource planning ERP and related boundary systems could adversely impact our ability to operate our business and report our financial results. 
 We utilize multiple platforms and ERP systems to record transactions, provide information to management, and prepare our financial statements. We are in the process of transitioning our ERP and other key boundary systems. This transition began in the third quarter of 2023 and will continue for the next couple of years with a large portion of our business transitioning to the new systems in the first quarter of 2025. While we believe our new ERP 
 12 

and boundary systems will enhance and standardize our processes, allow better oversight, and improve our service to our customers, any disruption to this transition could impact our ability to send and track invoices, process vendor payments, pay employees, fulfill contractual obligations, report our financial results, or otherwise operate our business. Such disruption could adversely affect our profitability and reputation. Additionally, any disruption could negatively impact the effectiveness of our controls. Refer to Risks Relating to Financial Matters below for further information on the internal controls. 
 Risks Relating to Acquisitions, Divestitures, or Strategic Transactions 
 Acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our results of operations. 
 In furtherance of our business strategy, we routinely evaluate opportunities and may enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, or other strategic transactions. A significant portion of our growth has been generated by acquisitions, and we may continue to acquire businesses in the future as part of our growth strategy. However, we may encounter challenges identifying opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us. Furthermore, there is no assurance that any such transaction will deliver the anticipated results, including expected synergistic benefits. A potential acquisition, divestiture, or other strategic transaction may involve a number of risks including, but not limited to: 
 the transaction may not effectively advance our business strategy, and its anticipated benefits may never materialize; 
 our ongoing operations may be disrupted, and management time and focus may be diverted; 
 clients or key employees of an acquired business may not remain, which could negatively impact our ability to grow that acquired business; 
 integration of an acquired business s accounting, information technology, cybersecurity, HR, and other administrative systems may fail to permit effective management and expense reduction; 
 unforeseen challenges may arise in implementing internal controls, procedures, and policies; 
 additional indebtedness incurred as a result of an acquisition may impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows; and 
 unanticipated or unknown liabilities may arise related to an acquired business. 
 Risks Relating to Insurance and Safety Matters 
 We manage our insurable risks through a combination of third-party purchased policies and self-insurance, and we retain a substantial portion of the risk associated with expected losses under these programs, which exposes us to volatility associated with those risks, including the possibility that changes in estimates to our ultimate insurance loss reserves could result in material charges against our earnings. 
 We use a combination of insured and self-insurance programs to cover workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability, property damage, and other insurable risks. We are responsible for claims both within and in excess of our retained limits under our insurance policies, and while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature, or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages. If our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, our business may be negatively impacted. 
 The determination of required insurance reserves is dependent upon actuarial judgments. We use the results of actuarial studies to estimate insurance rates and insurance reserves for future periods and to adjust reserves, if appropriate, for prior years. Actual experience related to our insurance reserves can cause us to change our estimates for reserves and any such changes may materially impact results, causing significant volatility in our operating results. 
 Should we be unable to renew our excess, umbrella, or other commercial insurance policies, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, as would the incurrence of catastrophic uninsured claims or the inability or refusal of our insurance carriers to pay otherwise insured claims. Further, to the extent that we self-insure our losses, deterioration in our loss control and/or our continuing claim management efforts could increase the overall 
 13 

cost of claims within our retained limits. A material change in our insurance costs due to changes in the frequency of claims, the severity of the claims, the costs of excess/umbrella premiums, or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 In 2015, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, IFM Assurance Company IFM ), which we believe has provided us with increased flexibility in the end-to-end management of our insurance program. There can be no assurance that IFM will continue to bring about the intended benefits or the desired flexibility in the management of our insurance programs, because we may experience unanticipated events that could reduce or eliminate expected benefits. 
 Our risk management and safety programs may not have the intended effect of reducing our liability for personal injury or property loss. 
 We attempt to mitigate risks relating to personal injury or property loss through the implementation of company-wide safety and loss control efforts designed to decrease the frequency of accidents or events that might increase our liability. However, incidents involving personal injury or property loss may be caused by multiple potential factors, a significant number of which are beyond our control. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our risk management and safety programs will have the desired effect of controlling costs and liability exposure. 
 Risks Relating to Labor, Legal Proceedings, Tax, and Regulatory Matters 
 Unfavorable developments in our class and representative actions and other lawsuits alleging various claims could cause us to incur substantial liabilities. 
 Our business involves employing tens of thousands of employees, many of whom work at our clients facilities. We incur risks relating to our employment of these workers, including, but not limited to: claims by our employees of discrimination, harassment, violations of wage and hour requirements, or violations of other federal, state, or local laws; claims of misconduct or negligence on the part of our employees; and claims related to the employment of unlicensed personnel. We also incur risks and claims related to the imposition on our employees of policies or practices of our clients that may be different from our own. Some or all of these claims may lead to litigation, including class action litigation, and these matters may cause us to incur negative publicity with respect to alleged claims. Additionally, there are risks to all employers in some states, such as California, resulting from large collective, class, Private Attorneys General Act actions, as well as from new and unanticipated judicial interpretations of existing laws and the application of those new interpretations against employers on a retroactive basis, which could involve substantial claims and significant defense costs. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceeding, and our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. These lawsuits and other proceedings may consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits may, individually or in the aggregate, cause us to incur substantial liabilities that could have a material adverse effect upon our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 We are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements, which could limit our profitability by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance. 
 Our business is subject to a complicated set of federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as stakeholder views addressing, among other things, wage and hour standards, employment and labor relations, various Corporate Responsibility-related practices, leave of absence, cybersecurity, data privacy and protection, occupational health and safety, environmental matters, anti-competition, anti-corruption, and government contracting. Many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards or legal interpretations across jurisdictions, increasing the complexity and cost of compliance. When federal, state, local, or foreign minimum wage rates increase, we may have to increase the wages of both minimum wage employees and employees whose wages are above the minimum wage. We may also face increased operating costs resulting from changes in federal, state, or local laws and regulations relating to employment matters, including those relating to meal and rest breaks, eligibility for overtime, pay transparency and reporting, sick pay, and predictive scheduling requirements. In addition, we expect there will likely be increasing and evolving levels of regulation, disclosure-related and otherwise, with respect to Corporate Responsibility (including environmental) matters, and increased regulation will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risks identified in this risk factor. Increased costs of legal and regulatory compliance with this constantly evolving legal and regulatory environment could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition. 
 14 

A significant number of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that could expose us to potential liabilities in relation to our participation in multiemployer pension plans, requirements to make contributions to other benefit plans, and the potential for strikes, work slowdowns, or similar activities, and union organizing drives. 
 We participate in various multiemployer pension plans that provide defined pension benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Because of the nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks to us associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer pension plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. In the event another participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, including us. In the event of the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or a complete or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, under applicable law we could incur material withdrawal liabilities. We further discuss our participation in multiemployer pension and postretirement plans in Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to consolidated financial statements. In addition, the terms of collective bargaining agreements require us to contribute to various fringe benefit plans, including health and welfare, pension, and training plans, all of which require us to have appropriate systems in place to assure timely and accurate payment of contributions. The failure to make timely and accurate contributions as a result of a systems failure could have a negative impact on our financial position. 
 At October 31, 2024, approximately 42 of our employees were subject to various local collective bargaining agreements, some of which will expire or become subject to renegotiation during 2025. In addition, at any given time we may face union organizing activity. When one or more of our major collective bargaining agreements becomes subject to renegotiation or when we face union organizing drives, any disagreement between us and the union on important issues may lead to a strike, work slowdown, or other job actions at one or more of our locations. In a market where we are unionized but competitors are not unionized, we could lose clients to such competitors. A strike, work slowdown, or other job action could disrupt our services, resulting in reduced revenues or contract cancellations. Moreover, negotiating a first time collective bargaining agreement or renegotiating an existing agreement could result in increases in labor and benefits expenses that we may be unable to pass through to clients. 
 Our business may be materially affected by changes to fiscal and tax policies. Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, primarily the UK and Ireland. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As tax rates vary among taxing jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination from taxing jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these audits to determine the adequacy of our income tax related provision. We may recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties due to adverse outcomes in tax audits or changes in laws, regulations, treaties, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities, and interpretations related to tax laws, including tax rules in various jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
 Risks Relating to Financial Matters 
 Future increases in the level of our borrowings and interest rates could affect our results of operations. 
 Any future interest rate increases would have corresponding impact to our costs of borrowing and may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise funds through the offering of our securities or through the issuance of debt due to higher debt capital costs, diminished credit availability, and less favorable equity markets. Any significant federal fund rate increases may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and may cause our customers to implement cost saving strategies that could reduce the demand of our services. 
 Our future ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other liquidity needs, and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in 
 15 

an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, fund other liquidity needs, make planned capital expenditures, or continue our dividend. 
 The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences for shareholders. For example, being highly leveraged could: require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, share repurchases, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes; limit our availability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business; and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt. 
 Further, our credit facility contains both financial covenants and other covenants that limit our ability to engage in specific transactions. Any failure to comply with covenants in the credit facility could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or more often if impairment indicators exist. We also review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the fair value of one of our reporting units is less than its carrying value, or if as a result of a recoverability test we conclude that the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, we would record an impairment charge related to goodwill or long-lived assets, respectively. (For example, during the second quarter of 2020, given the general deterioration in economic and market conditions arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic the Pandemic ), we identified a triggering event that resulted in the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.) The assumptions used to determine impairment require significant judgment, and the amount of the impairment could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken. 
 If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be negatively impacted, which could harm our operating results and investor perceptions of our Company and as a result may have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock. 
 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and, in some instances, remediation. We have acquired entities that had no publicly traded debt or equity and therefore were not previously required to conform to the rules and regulations of the SEC, especially related to their internal control structure. When we acquire such entities, they may not have in place all the necessary controls as required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Integrating acquired entities into our internal control over financial reporting has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel, which increases our compliance costs. We are required to include our assessment of the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting of entities we acquire in our overall assessment, so we must plan to complete the evaluation and integration of internal controls over financial reporting and report our assessment within the required time frame. 
 In addition, with the increasing frequency of cyber-related frauds perpetrated to obtain inappropriate payments, we need to ensure our internal controls related to authorizing the transfer of funds and changing our vendor master files are adequate. Furthermore, the introduction of new, and changes to existing, ERP and financial reporting information systems create implementation and change management risks that require effective internal controls to mitigate. Failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results, the market s perception of our business, and our stock price. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Our business may be negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions. 
 Weather conditions such as snow storms, heavy flooding, hurricanes, and fluctuations in temperatures can negatively impact portions of our business. Within our Technical Solutions segment, cooler than normal 
 16 

temperatures in the summer could reduce the need for servicing of air conditioning units, resulting in reduced revenues and profitability. Within Parking and Aviation services and portions of our Technical Solutions business, adverse weather conditions can lead to reduced activity, as well as increases in certain costs, both of which negatively affect gross profit. On the other hand, the absence of snow during the winter could cause us to experience reduced revenues in our B I segment, as many of our contracts specify additional payments for snow-related services. 
 Catastrophic events, disasters, pandemics, and terrorist attacks could disrupt our services. 
 We may encounter disruptions involving power, communications, transportation or other utilities, or essential services depended upon by us or by third parties with whom we conduct business. This could include disruptions due to disasters, pandemics, weather-related or similar events (such as fires, hurricanes, blizzards, earthquakes, and floods), political instability, labor strikes, or war (including acts of terrorism or hostilities) that could impact our markets. If a disruption occurs in one location and persons in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to or work from other locations, our ability to service and interact with our clients and others may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communications or travel. These events may increase the volatility of financial results due to unforeseen costs with partial or no corresponding compensation from clients. There also can be no assurance that the disaster recovery and crisis management procedures we employ will suffice in any particular situation to avoid a significant loss. In addition, to the extent centralized administrative locations are disabled for a long period of time, key business processes, such as accounts payable, information technology, payroll, and general management operations, could be interrupted. 
 Actions of activist investors could disrupt our business. 
 Public companies have been the target of activist investors. In the event that a third party, such as an activist investor, proposes to change our governance policies, board of directors, or other aspects of our operations or strategy, our review and consideration of such proposals may create a significant distraction for our management and employees. This could negatively impact our ability to execute various strategic initiatives and may require management to expend significant time and resources responding to such proposals. Such proposals may also create uncertainties with respect to our financial position and operations and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 ABM recognizes the importance of cybersecurity risk management, which is integrated within ABM s overall enterprise risk management framework and is aligned with standard industry information security frameworks. Specifically, cybersecurity is one of the key risk topics covered within ABM s enterprise risk framework through the Company s regular identification, assessment, and reporting processes. Our internal information security program is managed by a dedicated team of cybersecurity professionals led by our Chief Information Security Officer, who reports to our Chief Information Officer. 
 
 We have implemented cross-functional cybersecurity processes, technologies, and controls to aid in our efforts to assess, identify, and mitigate cybersecurity-related risks, as well as to detect and prevent cybersecurity incidents. In evaluating cybersecurity incidents, management considers the potential impact to our results of operations, control framework, and financial condition, as well as the potential impact, if any, to our business strategy or reputation. 
 
 We adhere to a risk-based, multi-layered defense in depth approach with multiple layers of security controls, including, but not limited to, security monitoring, endpoint protection, and identity and access management. We maintain processes designed to oversee and identify material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party technologies and systems, including, as appropriate, pre-procurement assessment of contractual terms addressing cybersecurity and data protection, as well as review based on assessed vendor risk. 
 
 We conduct regular testing and assessments of our systems and controls to evaluate our information security program s maturity and effectiveness, and from time-to-time we engage and retain expert external assessors and consultants to help improve our security, stay aligned with industry best practices, evaluate external threats, and periodically conduct independent security assessments. 
 
 ABM provides regular, mandatory training for our employees regarding cybersecurity threats to bring awareness on how they can help prevent and report potential cybersecurity incidents. We also provide regular cybersecurity awareness reminders to our employees. 
 
 Although the Company dedicates significant resources and efforts to protect against cybersecurity risks, the Company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats. To date, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, the Company continues to face cybersecurity risks such as those described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and there can be no assurance that cybersecurity threats or incidents will not have a material adverse effect on the Company in the future. While the Company maintains cyber risk insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from cybersecurity incidents. 
 Governance 
 ABM s management is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Company s cybersecurity policies, processes, practices, and risk management. Within management, the Company's Chief Information Security Officer has specific responsibility for cybersecurity risk management, reporting to the Chief Information Officer. The Chief Information Security Officer meets regularly with our executive management team to review our cybersecurity programs, objectives, trends and threats. Our Chief Information Officer has over 20 years of experience as a technology leader, with responsibilities for developing and executing technology strategies across diverse industries, including technology, commercial real estate, manufacturing, healthcare and aviation. Our Chief Information Security Officer also has over 20 years of significant leadership experience in audit, risk, compliance, and security across complex global organizations, and formerly held Chief Information Security Officer roles leading cybersecurity efforts at two Fortune 500 organizations. 
 
 Our Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of the Company s risk management and strategy related to its cybersecurity programs, policies, and practices, including (i) the Company s processes for assessing, identifying, managing, and mitigating material risks from cybersecurity threats and emerging cybersecurity developments and 
 18 

threats; (ii) whether any risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company; (iii) the expertise of members of management with respect to assessing and managing risks from cybersecurity threats; and (iv) the Company s disclosure controls and procedures with respect to material cybersecurity threats and incidents. The Board of Directors is assisted by its Stakeholder and Enterprise Risk Committee, which oversees the Company s enterprise risk management program and the Company s identification, evaluation, and mitigation of stakeholder risks, including those relating to cybersecurity. 
 
 In addition, ABM has a monitoring system and an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Board of Directors of any potentially material cybersecurity issues. Specifically, our cybersecurity operations team monitors and reviews cybersecurity developments and threats, makes an initial assessment of such developments and threats, and escalates to ABM s Chief Information Officer matters determined to require the attention of members of senior management. 
 
 ABM s Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer regularly provide reports and updates to other members of senior management, the Board of Directors, and the Stakeholder and Enterprise Risk Committee. In connection with these updates, the Board of Directors reviews the Company s cybersecurity programs and oversees the Company s efforts to continually enhance the Company s cybersecurity profile and to mitigate the risks relating to cybersecurity. The reports from ABM s Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer also include updates on emerging trends and progress on overall enterprise cybersecurity priorities.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 The following MD A is intended to facilitate an understanding of the results of operations and financial condition of ABM. This MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Financial Statements. This MD A contains both historical and forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. We make forward-looking statements related to future expectations, estimates, and projections that are uncertain and often contain words such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, likely, may, outlook, plan, predict, should, target, or other similar words or phrases. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part 1. of this Form 10-K under Item 1A. , Risk Factors, which are incorporated herein by reference. Our future results and financial condition may be materially different from those we currently anticipate. Throughout the MD A, amounts and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Unless otherwise indicated, all information in the MD A and references to years are based on our fiscal year, which ends on October 31. 
 Business Overview 
 
 ABM is a leading provider of integrated facility solutions, customized by industry, with a mission to make a difference, every person, every day . Our principal operations are in the United States, and in 2024 our U.S. operations generated approximately 93 of our revenues. 
 Strategic Growth 
 We remain focused on long-term, profitable growth by delivering valued service offerings to both new and existing clients within our industry groups and across our many service lines. Our revenue growth strategy is predicated on pursuing new sales and targeting a favorable retention rate among existing contracts. Cross-selling and up-selling projects and services is also an integral part of our strategy. We believe our strategic growth initiatives, coupled with our continued focus on marketing, capital, and sales resources, will increase profitability. 
 ELEVATE Transformation 
 Through our ELEVATE strategy, as described in Item 1., Business., we continue to focus our efforts on: 
 the client experience, by serving as a trusted advisor who can provide innovative multiservice solutions and consistent service delivery; 
 
 the team member experience, by investing in workforce management, training, developing the next generation of ABM leaders, and building on our inclusive culture; and 
 
 our use of technology and data to power client and employee experiences with cutting-edge data and analytics, processes, and tools that we expect to fundamentally change how we operate our business. 
 We believe that our technology and data investments will enable: the development and deployment of client-facing technology to improve service delivery to our clients; the use of advanced data analytics for sales targeting, employee retention, and recruiting; and the upgrade of our Enterprise Resource Planning and payroll systems.

Developments and Trends 
 
 Macro-Economic Environment in Commercial Real Estate and Other 
 On an ongoing basis, we monitor changes to the macro-economic environment and their potential impacts on demand for our services and on our financial condition. One such monitored change is the strength or softness of the commercial real estate industry, especially multi-tenant and owner-occupied commercial office buildings. The recent softness in the market is primarily attributable to the lingering effects of the Pandemic, especially the normalization of hybrid work, which has resulted in higher office vacancy rates. Given that Class A and high-quality commercial office buildings are a key end market for us, we have experienced modest declines in demand for janitorial services and work orders in these markets. We expect the occupancy rates of Class A and high-quality buildings and back-to office trends to improve throughout 2025 . 
 A large M D client completed its rebalancing of a portion of its work needs as part of its normal procurement process. We expect M D s financial results to be adversely impacted in the near-term. 
 Insurance Reserves 
 We use a combination of insured and self-insurance programs to cover workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability, property damage, and other insurable risks. Insurance claim liabilities represent our estimate of retained risks without regard to insurance coverage. We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain workers compensation and medical claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both filed claims and incurred but not reported claims IBNR Claims ). 
 With the assistance of third-party actuaries, we review our estimate of ultimate losses for IBNR Claims on a quarterly basis and adjust our required self-insurance reserves as appropriate. As part of this evaluation, we review the status of existing and new claim reserves as established by third-party claims administrators. The third-party claims administrators establish the case reserves based upon known factors related to the type and severity of the claims, demographic factors, legislative matters, and case law, as appropriate. We compare actual trends to expected trends and monitor claims developments. The specific case reserves estimated by the third-party administrators are provided to the actuary who assists us in projecting an actuarial estimate of the overall ultimate losses for our self-insured or high deductible programs, which includes the case reserves plus an actuarial estimate of reserves required for additional developments, such as IBNR Claims. We utilize the results of actuarial studies to estimate our insurance rates and insurance reserves for future periods and to adjust reserves, if appropriate, for prior years. 
 Based on the results of the actuarial reviews performed during 2024, which included analyzing recent loss development patterns, comparing the loss development against benchmarks, and applying actuarial projection methods to determine the estimate of ultimate losses, we increased our total reserves related to prior years for known claims as well as our estimate of the loss amounts associated with IBNR Claims by 20.3 million in 2024. In 2023, we decreased our total reserves related to prior year claims by 14.8 million.

Key Financial Highlights 
 Revenues increased by 263.0 million, or 3.2 , to 8,359.4 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. Revenue growth was comprised of organic growth of 2.9 and acquisition growth of 0.3 . The organic revenue growth was due to the higher project revenues due to the timing of certain microgrid systems design and installation projects within Technical Solutions, and net new business and expansion of business with existing customers within Aviation, M D, and Education. The increase in revenues was partially offset by attrition of engineering customers and soft commercial office market conditions within B I, and the expected rebalancing of the scope of work with an existing customer within M D. Acquisition growth of 26.3 million was driven by the Quality Uptime Acquisition, completed in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Operating profit decreased by 197.5 million to 212.0 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. The decrease in operating profit was attributable to: 
 an increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the RavenVolt Acquisition; 
 an increase in other Corporate expenses, primarily costs associated with various systems go-live and other investments in technology; 
 an unfavorable self-insurance reserve adjustment related to prior year claims from actuarial evaluations completed in 2024, as compared to a favorable adjustment in 2023; 
 an absence of employee retention credits received as compared to 2023; and 
 11.4 million in revenue recognized for an Aviation parking project during 2023, whereby all the direct labor and related costs for such project were recognized prior to 2023. 
 The decrease was partially offset by: 
 labor efficiencies within B I, Aviation, and Education, as well as contract mix within Technical Solutions, Aviation, and M and 
 a decrease in amortization of intangibles, primarily related to the RavenVolt Acquisition. 
 Our effective tax rate on income was 39.1 for 2024, as compared to 24.1 during 2023. Our effective tax rate for 2024 was primarily impacted by a 95.7 million non-taxable expense related to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the RavenVolt Acquisition. Our effective tax rate for 2023 was primarily impacted by a 45.6 million non-taxable benefit related to the change in the fair value of contingent consideration related to the RavenVolt Acquisition. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 226.7 million during 2024. Our net cash provided by operating cash activities was lower than prior year, primarily due to the timing of certain working capital requirements. 
 Dividends of 56.5 million were paid to shareholders, and dividends totaling 0.90 per common share were declared during 2024. Additionally, we repurchased 1.17 million of shares for 55.8 million, excluding excise taxes during 2024. 
 At October 31, 2024, total outstanding borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility were 1,335.3 million, and we had up to 423.6 million of borrowing capacity.

 The Year Ended October 31, 2024, Compared with the Year Ended October 31, 2023 
 Revenues 
 Revenues increased by 263.0 million, or 3.2 , to 8,359.4 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. Revenue growth was comprised of organic growth of 2.9 and acquisition growth of 0.3 . The organic revenue growth was due to the higher project revenues due to the timing of certain microgrid systems design and installation projects within Technical Solutions, and net new business and expansion of business with existing customers within Aviation, M D, and Education. The increase in revenues was partially offset by attrition of engineering customers within B I and the expected rebalancing of the scope of work with an existing customer within M D. Acquisition growth of 26.3 million was driven by the Quality Uptime Acquisition, completed in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses increased by 288.3 million, or 4.1 , to 7,325.9 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. Gross margin decreased by 71 bps to 12.4 in 2024, as compared to 13.1 in 2023. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in self-insurance adjustments related to prior year claims as a result of actuarial evaluations completed on our workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability, and property damage insurance plans. In addition, the decrease in gross margin was attributable to the 11.4 million in revenue from an Aviation parking project recognized in 2023. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 192.5 million, or 33.6 , to 765.3 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to: 
 a 95.7 million fair value adjustment to increase the contingent consideration related to the RavenVolt Acquisition recorded during 2024, as compared to a 45.6 million fair value adjustment to decrease the contingent consideration recorded during 2023; 
 25 

a 24.3 million increase in costs associated with various systems go-live and other investments in technology; 
 an absence of a 24.0 million benefit from employee retention credits received during 2023; 
 an 8.8 million increase in accruals for actual and potential legal settlements; and 
 a 6.5 million increase in compensation and related expenses primarily due to higher compensation under certain incentive plans. 
 This increase was partially offset by: 
 an 18.6 million decrease in certain discrete transformational costs under our ELEVATE strategy for developing the new ERP system, client-facing technology, workforce management tools, and data analytics. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets decreased by 20.4 million, or 26.6 , to 56.1 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the lower amortization of intangibles, primarily intangibles acquired as part of the RavenVolt Acquisition. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased by 2.7 million, or 3.3 , to 85.0 million during 2024, as compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher borrowings from our Amended Credit Facility to fund the Quality Uptime Acquisition. 
 Income Taxes 
 During 2024 and 2023, we had effective tax rates of 39.1 and 24.1 , respectively, resulting in a provision for tax of 52.2 million and 79.7 million, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2024 was negatively impacted by a 95.7 million non-taxable expense related to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the RavenVolt Acquisition. Our effective tax rate for 2023 was favorably impacted by a 45.6 million non-taxable benefit related to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the RavenVolt Acquisition. 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 We had a loss of 22.9 million on interest rate swaps during the year ended October 31, 2024, as compared to a loss of 0.5 million during the year ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to underlying changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps. 
 Foreign Currency Translation and Other 
 We had a foreign currency translation gain of 7.5 million during the year ended October 31, 2024, as compared to a foreign currency translation gain of 7.3 million during the year ended October 31, 2023. This change was due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar USD and the British pound sterling GBP ). Future gains and losses on foreign currency translation will be dependent upon changes in the relative value of foreign currencies to the USD and the extent of our foreign assets and liabilities. 
 The Year Ended October 31, 2023, Compared with the Year Ended October 31, 2022

 B I revenues decreased by 30.3 million, or 0.7 , to 4,059.1 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. The revenue decrease was primarily driven by attrition of certain engineering clients and soft commercial office market conditions, partially offset by the new clients and existing client expansions both domestically and internationally. Management reimbursement revenues for this segment totaled 281.4 million and 270.1 million during 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Operating profit decreased by 8.6 million, or 2.7 , to 307.0 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. Operating profit margin decreased by 15 bps to 7.6 in 2024 from 7.7 in 2023. The decrease in operating profit margin was primarily driven by a change in contract mix and higher legal, bad debt, and insurance expense. The decrease was partially offset by labor efficiencies and lower amortization of intangible assets.

Education Year Ended October 31, in millions) 2024 2023 Increase Revenues 904.0 880.4 23.6 2.7 Operating profit 55.3 49.7 5.6 11.4 Operating profit margin 6.1 5.6 48 bps 
 Education revenues increased by 23.6 million, or 2.7 , to 904.0 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to net new business wins, partially offset by a decrease in work orders. 
 Operating profit increased by 5.6 million, or 11.4 to 55.3 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. Operating profit margin increased by 48 bps to 6.1 in 2024 from 5.6 in 2023. The operating profit margin was positively impacted by labor efficiencies and lower amortization of intangibles, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. 
 Technical Solutions Year Ended October 31, in millions) 2024 2023 Increase Revenues 809.3 674.2 135.1 20.0 Operating profit 69.4 53.2 16.2 30.4 Operating profit margin 8.6 7.9 68 bps 
 Technical Solutions revenues increased by 135.1 million, or 20.0 , to 809.3 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. Revenue growth was comprised of organic growth of 16.1 and acquisition growth of 3.9 . The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by higher project revenues due to the timing of completions of microgrid systems and generators installation projects, partially offset by a decrease in electric vehicle charging station sales. Acquisition growth of 26.3 million was driven by the Quality Uptime Acquisition, completed in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Operating profit increased by 16.2 million, or 30.4 , to 69.4 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. Operating profit margin increased by 68 bps to 8.6 in 2024 from 7.9 in 2023. The increase in operating profit margin was primarily attributable to the contract mix and lower amortization of intangible assets. This increase was partially offset by an expected charge to potentially settle a certain client matter. 
 Corporate Year Ended October 31, in millions) 2024 2023 Increase Corporate expenses (433.1) (226.6) 206.5 (91.1) 
 Corporate expenses increased by 206.5 million, or 91.1 , to 433.1 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily related to: 
 a 95.7 million fair value adjustment to increase the contingent consideration related to the RavenVolt Acquisition recorded during 2024, as compared to a 45.6 million fair value adjustment to decrease the contingent consideration recorded during 2023; 
 a 20.3 million unfavorable self-insurance reserve adjustment related to prior year claims from actuarial evaluations completed during 2024, as compared to a favorable 14.8 million adjustment recorded in 2023; 
 a 24.3 million increase in costs associated with various systems go-live and other investments in technology; and 
 an absence of a 24.0 million benefit from employee retention credits received during 2023. 
 This increase was partially offset by: 
 29 

an 18.6 million decrease in certain discrete transformational costs under our ELEVATE strategy for developing the new ERP system, client-facing technology, workforce management tools, and data analytics.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under our credit facility. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our short- and long-term cash requirements. As such, we project our anticipated cash requirements as well as cash flows generated from operating activities to meet those needs. 
 In addition to normal working capital requirements, we anticipate that our short- and long-term cash requirements will include funding insurance claims, dividend payments, capital expenditures, share repurchases, mandatory loan repayments, contingent consideration payments from acquisitions, and systems and technology transformation initiatives under our ELEVATE strategy. We anticipate long-term cash uses may also include strategic acquisitions. On a long-term basis, we will continue to rely on our credit facility for any long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows. 
 We believe that our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under our credit facility are sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least a 12-month period from the issuance of these financial statements. In the event that our plans change or our cash requirements are greater than we anticipate, we may need to access the capital markets to finance future cash requirements. However, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us should we need it or, if available, that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to existing shareholders. 
 Credit Facility 
 On September 1, 2017, we refinanced and replaced our then-existing 800.0 million credit facility with a new senior, secured five-year syndicated credit facility (the Credit Facility ), consisting of a 900.0 million revolving line of credit and an 800.0 million amortizing term loan. In accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility, the revolving line of credit was reduced to 800.0 million on September 1, 2018. 
 On June 28, 2021, the Company amended and restated the Credit Facility (the Second Amendment, and the Credit Facility as amended, the Amended Credit Facility ), extending the maturity date to June 28, 2026, and increasing the capacity of the revolving credit facility from 800.0 million to 1.3 billion and the then-remaining term loan outstanding from 620.0 million to 650.0 million. The Amended Credit Facility provides for the issuance of up to 350.0 million for standby letters of credit and the issuance of up to 75.0 million in swingline advances. The obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are secured on a first-priority basis by a lien on substantially all of our assets and properties, subject to certain exceptions. We may repay amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Facility at any time without penalty. 
 At November 1, 2022, we amended our Amended Credit Facility pursuant to the LIBOR Transition Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to replace the benchmark rate at which U.S.-dollar-denominated borrowings bear interest from LIBOR to the forward-looking SOFR term rate administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited. As a result of these amendments, we can borrow at Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 subject to a floor of zero. 
 The Amended Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a maximum total net leverage ratio of 5.00 to 1.00, a maximum secured net leverage ratio of 4.00 to 1.00, and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00, as well as other financial and non-financial covenants. In the event of a material acquisition, as defined in the Amended Credit Facility, we may elect to increase the maximum total net leverage ratio to 5.50 to 1.00 for a total of four fiscal quarters and increase the maximum secured net leverage ratio to 4.50 to 1.00 for a total of four fiscal quarters. Our borrowing capacity is subject to, and limited by, compliance with the covenants described above. At October 31, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants and expect to be in compliance in the foreseeable future. 
 During 2024, we made 32.5 million of principal payments under the term loan. At October 31, 2024, the total outstanding borrowings and standby letters of credit were 1,335.3 million and 57.9 million, respectively. At October 31, 2024, we had up to 423.6 million of borrowing capacity. 
 Reinvestment of Foreign Earnings 
 We plan to reinvest our foreign earnings to fund future non-U.S. growth and expansion, and we do not anticipate remitting such earnings to the United States. While U.S. federal tax expense has been recognized as a 
 31 

result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been recognized. We believe that our cash on hand in the United States, along with our Amended Credit Facility and future domestic cash flows, are sufficient to satisfy our domestic liquidity requirements. 
 Share Repurchases 
 Effective December 13, 2023, our Board of Directors expanded our existing share repurchase program by an additional 150.0 million of our common stock. We repurchased shares under the share repurchase program during the year ended October 31, 2024, as summarized below. At October 31, 2024, authorization for 154.5 million of repurchases remained under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 Years Ended October 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 Total number of shares purchased 1.17 3.34 Average price paid per share (1) 
 47.86 41.06 Total cash paid for share repurchases (1) 
 55.8 137.1 
 (1) Average price paid per share and total cash paid for share repurchases do not include any excise tax for stock repurchases as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. 
 Proceeds from Federal Energy Savings Performance Contracts 
 As part of our Technical Solutions business, we enter into energy savings performance contracts ESPC with the federal government pursuant to which we agree to develop, design, engineer, and construct a project and guarantee that the project will satisfy agreed-upon performance standards. Proceeds from ESPC projects are generally received in advance of construction through agreements to sell the ESPC receivables to unaffiliated third parties. We use the advances from the third parties under these agreements to finance the projects, which are recorded as cash flows from financing activities. The use of the cash received under these arrangements to pay project costs is classified as operating cash flows. 
 Effect of Inflation 
 The rates of inflation experienced in recent years have not had a material impact on our Financial Statements. We attempt to recover increased costs by increasing prices for our services to the extent permitted by contracts and competition. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and/or local laws, rules, and regulations regulating among other things, labor, wages, and health and safety matters, as well as laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Historically, the cost of complying with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 In addition to revenues and operating profit, our management views operating cash flows as a good indicator of financial performance, because strong operating cash flows provide opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisitions. Operating cash flows primarily depend on: revenue levels; profitability levels of our jobs; the quality and timing of collections of accounts receivable; the timing of payments to suppliers and other vendors; the timing and amount of income tax payments; the actual payments of contingent consideration made in excess of the acquisition-date fair value; and the timing and amount of payments on insurance claims and legal 
 32 

settlements. Year Ended October 31, (in millions) 2024 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities 226.7 243.3 20.4 Net cash used in investing activities (171.9) (62.1) (241.5) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (61.5) (186.3) 235.5 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 16.6 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of working capital requirements. The decrease was partially offset by the absence of a 66.0 million payment of deferred payroll taxes done in 2023. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 222.9 million during 2023, as compared to 2022. The increase was primarily driven by a 143.8 million payment made for the Bucio settlement in 2022 and the related income tax benefit. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities changed by 109.8 million during 2024, as compared to 2023. The change was primarily related to the Quality Uptime Acquisition, completed in 2024. 
 Net cash used in investing activities changed by 179.5 million during 2023, as compared to 2022. The change was primarily related to the Momentum and RavenVolt acquisitions, completed in 2022. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 61.5 million in 2024, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 186.3 million in 2023. The decrease in net cash used was primarily related to lower share buyback repurchases in 2024 and an increase in our book cash overdrafts. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 186.3 million in 2023, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 235.5 million in 2022. The change was primarily related to a decrease in net borrowings from our Amended Credit Facility, as in 2022 we had higher borrowings to fund the Momentum and RavenVolt acquisitions and higher share repurchases in 2023. 
 
 Dividends 
 On December 5, 2024, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of 0.265 per share on our common stock, payable on February 3, 2025, to shareholders of record on January 2, 2025. We declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock every quarter during 2024, 2023, and 2022. We paid total annual dividends of 56.5 million, 57.5 million, and 51.9 million during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 

Material Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations 
 
 As of October 31, 2024, our material cash requirements for our known contractual and other obligations were as follows: 
 
 Debt Obligations and Interest Payments Outstanding payments on our Amended Credit Facility were 1,335.3 million, with 32.5 million payable within 12 months. We have future interest payments based on our hedged borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility of 15.7 million, which is payable within 12 months. The interest payments on our remaining borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility will be determined based upon the average outstanding balance of our borrowings and the prevailing interest rate during that time. See Note 11, Credit Facility, in the Financial Statements for further detail of our debt and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments. 
 
 33 

Operating and Finance Leases We enter into various noncancelable l ease agreements for office space, parking facilities, warehouses, vehicles, and equipment used in the normal course of business. Operating and finance lease obligations were 160.0 million, with 37.4 million payable within 12 months. See Note 5, Leases, in the Financial Statements for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments. 
 
 Service Concession Arrangements As defined under ASU No. 2017-10, Service Concession Arrangements (Topic 853) : Determining the Customer of the Operation Services , our leased location parking arrangements are represented as service concession arrangements. We had contractual payments for these arrangements of 71.4 million, with 25.0 million payable within 12 months. 
 
 Information Technology Service Agreement s Information technology service agreements represent outsourced services and licensing costs pursuant to our information technology agreements. We had contractual payments for these agreements of 117.1 million, with 49.7 million payable within 12 months. 
 
 Benefit Obligations Expected future payments relating to our defined benefit, postretirement, and deferred compensation plans were 38.1 million, with 3.4 million payable in 12 months. These amounts are based on expected future service and were calculated using the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at October 31, 2024. 
 Contingent Consideration Payable Connection with Our Acquisition of RavenVolt At October 31, 2024, contingent consideration of up to 75.0 million in cash may be paid in calendar year 2025 if the RavenVolt business achieves certain financial targets in calendar year 2024, as defined in the merger agreement . We expect the RavenVolt business to achieve the aforementioned financial targets for calendar year 2024, and as such, we currently expect to make a 75.0 million payment in May 2025 for calendar year 2024. 
 
 In addition, our material cash requirements for other obligations, for which we cannot reasonably estimate future payments, include the following: 
 
 Multiemployer Benefit Plans In addition to our company sponsored benefit plans, we participate in certain multiemployer pension and other postretirement plans. The cost of these plans is equal to the annual required contributions determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated collective bargaining arrangements. During 2024, 2023, and 2022, contributions made to these plans were 565.9 million, 574.6 million, and 555.1 million, respectively; however, our future contributions to the multiemployer plans are dependent upon a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans, the ability of other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations, and the level of our ongoing participation in these plans. Amounts of future contributions that we would be contractually obligated to make pursuant to these plans cannot be reasonably estimated. See Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Financial Statements for more information. 
 
 Self-Insurance Obligations We may make payments for exposures for which we are self-insured, including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability, property damage, and other insurable risks. At October 31, 2024, our self-insurance reserves, net of recoverables, were 517.3 million. As these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the amount or timing of cash that may be required to settle these matters. See Note 10, Insurance, in the Financial Statements for further detail. 
 
 Unrecognized Tax Benefits At October 31, 2024, our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 7.9 million. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the taxing authorities is subject to significant uncertainty, and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the amount or timing of cash that may be required to settle these matters. In addition, certain of these matters may not require cash settlements due to the utilization of credits and net operating loss carryforwards as well as other offsets, including the indirect benefit from other taxing jurisdictions that may be available. 
 
 Contingent Consideration Payable in Connection with Our Acquisition of RavenVolt At October 31, 2024, contingent consideration of up to 205.0 million, of which 34.1 million has been accrued as of October 31, 2024, in cash may be paid in calendar year 2026 if the RavenVolt business achieves certain financial targets in calendar year 2025, as defined in the merger agreement. 
 34 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than unrecorded standby letters of credit and surety bonds. We use letters of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to ensure the performance of contractual obligations and to collateralize self-insurance obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations. As we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs, these do not represent additional liabilities. The surety bonds typically remain in force for one to five years and may include optional renewal periods. As of October 31, 2024, these letters of credit totaled 57.9 million, and surety bonds and surety-backed letters of credit totaled 854.7 million, respectively. Neither of these arrangements has a material current effect, or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
 35 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP requires our management to make certain estimates that affect the reported amounts. We base our estimates on historical experience, known or expected trends, independent valuations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates for the year ended October 31, 2024. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Financial Statements. 
 
 36 

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Valuation of Long-Lived Assets 
 We evaluate our fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. These events and circumstances include, but are not limited to: higher than expected attrition for customer relationships; a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, such as when we classify a business as held for sale; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long-lived asset; or a change in the physical condition of a long-lived asset. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists; if impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units and instead perform a quantitative impairment test. 
 Our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a long-lived asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Incorrect estimation of useful lives may result in inaccurate depreciation and amortization charges over future periods leading, to future impairment. 
 Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. 
 We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. 
 The income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow method in which the estimated future cash flows and terminal value are calculated for each reporting unit and then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. 
 The valuation of our reporting units requires significant judgment in evaluation of recent indicators of market activity and estimated future cash flows, discount rates, and other factors. Our impairment analyses contain inherent uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact anticipated future economic and operating conditions. 
 In making these estimates, the weighted-average cost of capital is utilized to calculate the present value of future cash flows and terminal value. Many variables go into estimating future cash flows, including estimates of our future revenue growth and operating results. When estimating our projected revenue growth and future operating results, we consider industry trends, economic data, and our competitive advantage. 
 The market approach estimates fair value of a reporting unit by using market comparables for reasonably similar public companies. 
 
 During the last three years, we have not made any changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets or to estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets. Additionally, we have not made any changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill during the last three years. 
 
 At October 31, 2024, we had 2.6 billion of goodwill. Our goodwill is included in the following segments: 
 
 1.1 billion B I 
 
 502.2 million M D 
 
 459.3 million Education 
 
 69.4 million Aviation 
 
 449.6 million Technical Solutions 
 
 A goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of our reporting units on August 1, 2024. Based on these studies, the implied fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value, with the exception of the Education reporting unit which had an excess of 25 . Therefore, we concluded there were no indicators of impairment. A 10 decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units would not have resulted in a different conclusion. We concluded there were no indicators of impairment.

38 

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insured and self-insurance programs to cover workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability, property damage, and other insurable risks. 
 
 Insurance claim liabilities represent our estimate of retained risks without regard to insurance coverage. We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain workers compensation and medical claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and IBNR Claims. 
 
 With the assistance of third-party actuaries, we periodically review our estimate of ultimate losses for IBNR Claims and adjust our required self-insurance reserves as appropriate. As part of this evaluation, we review the status of existing and new claim reserves as established by our third-party claims administrators. 
 
 The third-party claims administrators establish the case reserves based upon known factors related to the type and severity of the claims, demographic data, legislative matters, and case law, as appropriate. 
 
 We compare actual trends to expected trends and monitor claims development. 
 
 The specific case reserves estimated by the third-party administrators are provided to an actuary who assists us in projecting an actuarial estimate of the overall ultimate losses for our self-insured or high deductible programs. The projection includes the case reserves plus an actuarial estimate of reserves required for additional developments, including IBNR Claims. 
 
 We utilize the results of actuarial studies to estimate our insurance rates and insurance reserves for future periods and to adjust reserves, if appropriate, for prior years. 
 
 Our self-insurance liabilities contain uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used. Costs to settle our obligations, including legal and healthcare costs, could fluctuate and cause estimates of our self-insurance liabilities to change. Incident rates, including frequency and severity, could fluctuate and cause the estimates in our self-insurance liabilities to change. These estimates are subject to: changes in the regulatory environment; fluctuations in projected exposures, including payroll, revenues, and the number of vehicle units; and the frequency, lag, and severity of claims. The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not be fully determined for several years. In addition, if the reserves related to self-insurance or high deductible programs from acquired businesses are not adequate to cover damages resulting from future accidents or other incidents, we may be exposed to substantial losses arising from future claim developments. We have not made any changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance liabilities during the past three years. 
 
 After analyzing recent loss development patterns, comparing the loss development patterns against benchmarks, and applying actuarial projection methods to estimate the ultimate losses, we increased our total reserves related to prior years for known claims as well as our estimate of the loss amounts associated with IBNR Claims during 2024 by 20.3 million. In 2023, we decreased our total reserves related to prior years claims by 14.8 million. 
 
 It is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities. Our insurance claims liabilities as of October 31, 2024 amounted to 619.4 million. A 10 change in our projected ultimate losses would have affected net income by approximately 37.2 million for 2024.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk through our variable rate borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility, as further described in Note 11 , Credit Facility, in the Financial Statements. Under the Amended Credit Facility, the term loan and U.S.-dollar-denominated borrowings under the revolver bear interest at a rate equal to one-month SOFR plus a spread. Euro- and sterling-denominated borrowings under the revolver bear at rate equal to the EURIBOR and SONIA reference rates, respectively, plus a spread. At October 31, 2024, we had total outstanding borrowings of 1,335.3 million. To limit exposure to upward movements in interest rates associated with our floating-rate, SOFR-based borrowings, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rates on a portion of our outstanding borrowings. At October 31, 2024, we had interest rate swaps with an underlying notional amount of 695.0 million and fixed interest rates ranging from 1.72 to 3.81 . Based on our average borrowings, interest rates, and interest rate swaps in effect at October 31, 2024 and 2023, a 100 basis point increase in SOFR, EURIBOR, and SONIA would decrease our future earnings and cash flows by 5.6 million and 5.4 million, respectively. As actual interest rate movements over time are uncertain, our interest rate swaps pose potential interest rate risks if interest rates decrease. As of October 31, 2024, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was an asset of 13.5 million. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are primarily exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate risk through our UK and Ireland operations where the functional currency is the British pound sterling GBP and Euro EUR ), respectively. As we intend to remain permanently invested in these foreign operations, we do not utilize hedging instruments to mitigate foreign currency exchange risks. If we change our intent with respect to such international investment, we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows.

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ABM Industries Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated December 19, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Valuation of self-insurance liabilities 
 As discussed in Notes 2 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company uses a combination of insured and self-insurance programs to cover insurable risks. The balance of casualty program insurance reserves as of October 31, 2024, amounted to 608.4 million, a portion of which related to workers compensation and general liability self-insurance liabilities. The Company engages actuaries to estimate its self-insurance liabilities at least annually. 
 42 

We identified the evaluation of certain workers compensation and general liability self-insurance liabilities as a critical audit matter because it involves a high degree of judgment and actuarial expertise to assess: (1) the application of actuarial models used and (2) estimated incurred but not reported claims based on application of loss development factors to historical claims experience. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s self-insurance liability process, including controls related to (1) evaluation of claims information sent to the actuary, (2) estimation of incurred but not reported claims based on the application of loss development factors to historical claims experience, and (3) evaluation of the actuarial report and the external actuarial specialist s qualifications and competency. We evaluated the Company s historical ability to estimate self-insurance liabilities by comparing the prior year recorded amounts to the subsequent claim development. We tested a sample of the claims data utilized by the Company s actuaries by comparing it to underlying claims details; and involved an actuarial professional with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in the: 
 
 assessment of the application of the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards and 
 development of an actuarial estimate of self-insurance liabilities based on the Company s underlying historical paid and incurred loss data for comparison with the liabilities recorded by the Company.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 1980.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 ABM Industries Incorporated: 

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited ABM Industries Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated December 19, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

44 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 In addition, we depreciate assets under finance leases and leasehold improvements over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. Upon retirement or sale of an asset, we remove the cost and accumulated depreciation from our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When applicable, we record corresponding gains or losses within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

years. Some leases include options to renew or extend. We typically include extension options in a lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option and when doing so is at our sole discretion. Certain equipment and vehicle leases may also include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Typically, if we decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, then we would owe the lessor the remaining lease payments under the term of such lease. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. We may rent or sublease certain real estate assets that we no longer use to third parties. 
 Lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, rent holidays, or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced by lease incentive amounts. 
 Certain of our lease agreements include variable rent payments consisting primarily of rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation, maintenance, and utilities . These costs are expensed as incurred. Certain of our parking arrangements also contain variable rent payments that are a percentage of parking services revenue based on contractual levels. We record contingent rent as it becomes probable that specified targets will be met. Vari able rent lease components are not included in the lease liability.

million, million, and million during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 
 Leased Location 
 Under leased location parking arrangements, we pay a fixed amount of rent, plus a percentage of revenues derived from monthly and transient parkers, to the property owner. We retain all revenues received, and we are responsible for most operating expenses incurred. We measure progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation as the services are provided, and revenue is recognized over time, because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services as they are performed. 
 Rental expense and certain other expenses under contracts that meet the definition of service concession arrangements are recorded as a reduction of revenue. 
 Allowance 
 Under allowance parking arrangements, we are paid a fixed amount or hourly rate to provide parking services, and we are responsible for certain operating expenses that are specified in the contract. We measure progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation as the services are provided, and revenue is recognized at the agreed-upon contractual rate over time, because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services as they are performed. 
 Energy Savings Contracts and Fixed-Price Repair and Refurbishment 
 Under energy savings contracts and fixed-price repair and refurbishment arrangements, we agree to develop, design, engineer, and construct a project. Additionally, as part of bundled energy solutions arrangements, we guarantee the project will satisfy agreed-upon performance standards. 
 We use the cost-to-cost method, which compares the actual costs incurred to date with the current estimate of total costs to complete, to measure the satisfaction of the performance obligation and recognize revenue as work progresses and we incur costs on our contracts; we believe this method best reflects the transfer of control to the customer. This measurement and comparison process requires updates to the estimate of total costs to complete the contract, and these updates may include subjective assessments and judgments. Equipment purchased for these projects is project-specific and considered a value-added element to our work. Equipment costs are incurred when the title is transferred to us, typically upon delivery to the work site. Revenue for uninstalled equipment is recognized at cost and the associated margin is deferred until installation is substantially complete. 
 We recognize revenue over time for all of our services as we perform them, because (i) control continuously transfers to the customer as work progresses, or (ii) we have the right to bill the customer as costs are incurred. The customer typically controls the work in process, as evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternative use to us. 
 Certain project contracts include a schedule of billings or invoices to the customer based on our job-to-date percentage of completion of specific tasks inherent in the fulfillment of our performance obligation(s) or in accordance with a fixed billing schedule. Fixed billing schedules may not precisely match the actual costs incurred. Therefore, revenue recognized may differ from amounts that can be billed or invoiced to the customer at any point during the contract, resulting in balances that are considered revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed or 
 57 

renewable agreements. 
 Franchise 
 We franchise certain engineering services through individual and area franchises under the Linc Service and TEGG brands, which are part of ABM Technical Solutions. Initial franchise fees result from the sale of a franchise license and include the use of the name, trademarks, and proprietary methods. The franchise license is considered symbolic intellectual property, and revenue related to the sale of this right is recognized at the agreed-upon contractual amount over the term of the initial franchise agreement. 
 Royalty fee revenue consists of sales-based royalties received as part of the consideration for the franchise right, which is calculated as a percentage of the franchisees revenue. We recognize royalty fee revenue at the agreed-upon contractual rates over time as the customer revenue is generated by the franchisees. A receivable is recognized for an estimate of the unreported royalty fees, which are reported and remitted to us in arrears. 
 Microgrid Systems and Uninterrupted Power Supply Systems Installation 
 We provide electrical contracting services for energy related products such as the installation of solar solutions, battery storage, distributed generation, and other specialized electric trades. 
 We use the cost-to-cost method, which compares the actual costs incurred to date with the current estimate of total costs to complete, to measure the satisfaction of the performance obligation and recognize revenue as work progresses and we incur costs on our contracts; we believe this method best reflects the transfer of control to the customer. This measurement and comparison process requires updates to the estimate of total costs to complete the contract, and these updates may include subjective assessments and judgments. 
 Certain projects include service maintenance agreements under which existing systems are repaired and maintained for a specific period of time. We generally recognize revenue under these arrangements over time. Our service maintenance agreements are generally renewable agreements. 
 Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer 
 We capitalize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, primarily commissions, as contract assets and recognize the expense on a straight-line basis over a weighted average expected customer relationship period. Capitalized commissions are classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the expense. 
 Contract Balances 
 The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in contract assets and contract liabilities, as further explained below. The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. If a contract includes a cancellation clause that allows for the termination of the contract by either party without a substantive penalty, then the contract term is limited to the termination notice period. 
 Contract assets primarily consist of billed trade receivables, unbilled trade receivables, and costs incurred in excess of amounts billed. Billed and unbilled trade receivables represent amounts from work completed in which we have an unconditional right to bill our customer. Costs incurred in excess of amounts billed typically arise when the revenue recognized on projects exceeds the amount billed to the customer. These amounts are transferred to billed trade receivables when the rights become unconditional. Contract assets also include the capitalization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, primarily commissions. 
 Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. We generally classify contract liabilities as current since the related contracts are generally for a period of one year or less. Contract liabilities decrease as we recognize revenue from the satisfaction of the related performance obligation.

 million (subject to customary working capital adjustments). The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized on the date of acquisition at their estimated fair values, with the excess of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The goodwill is amortizable over years for income tax purposes. As of October 31, 2024, we recorded preliminary goodwill and intangibles of million and million, respectively. The total assets acquired, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and liabilities assumed amounted to million and million, respectively. The acquisition accounting is subject to change as we obtain additional information about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date during the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date. The final acquisition accounting may include changes to non-current assets, including intangible assets and working capital. 
 The Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the year ended October 31, 2024, include revenues attributable to Quality Uptime of million. The operations of Quality Uptime are included in our Technical Solutions segment. 
 Acquisition of RavenVolt 
 On September 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of RavenVolt, Inc. RavenVolt ), a nationwide provider of advanced turn-key microgrid systems utilized by diversified commercial and industrial customers, national retailers, utilities, and municipalities. RavenVolt s operations are included within our Technical Solutions segment. The transaction met the definition of a business combination. We applied the acquisition method of accounting. 
 The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately million in cash at closing (subject to customary working capital and net debt adjustments) plus the potential of post-closing contingent consideration of up to million. The post closing contingent consideration would be payable in cash in calendar years 2024, 2025, and 2026 if RavenVolt s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA ), as defined in the RavenVolt merger agreement, meets or exceeds certain defined targets. The defined EBITDA targets for calendar year 2023 were not achieved, and as a result, contingent consideration payment was made in 2024. The maximum remaining contingent consideration that is payable in calendar years 2025 and 2026 is million, and million, respectively. If the EBITDA achieved for calendar years 2023 - 2025 cumulatively meets the defined EBITDA targets, the entire million would be paid in calendar year 2026, minus any earn-out payments made in 2024 and 2025. 
 To estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration on the date of acquisition, we used the Real Options method. The key assumptions used in our valuation were: i) forecast of revenues and EBITDA margins; ii) the volatility associated with the EBITDA; iii) risk-adjusted discount rate applied to forecasted EBITDA; and (iv) the credit-adjusted discount rate related to the payment of the contingent consideration. A simulation of one million scenarios was performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, resulting in a fair value for the cumulative contingent consideration for calendar years 2023 through 2025 totaling million. 
 At October 31, 2023, the estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration was million. Changes in results of operations and management s forecasts during 2024 for calendar years 2024 and 2025 were primarily due to the timing of large microgrid systems and generators installation project performing better than anticipated, resulting in a total increase of fair value to million at October 31, 2024, of which million relates to the calendar year 2024 payment to be made in 2025. Given the relatively short period of time until the end of the earn-out period, there is a high level of confidence in the projections for calendar year 2024 that are the basis for the estimated contingent consideration payment. This change in the fair value is recognized within the Selling, general and administrative expenses of the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

million. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately of the remaining performance obligations over the next months, with the remainder recognized thereafter, based on our estimates of project timing. 
 These amounts exclude variable consideration primarily related to: (i) contracts where we have determined that the contract consists of a series of distinct service periods and revenues are based on future performance that cannot be estimated at contract inception; (ii) parking contracts where we and the customer share the gross revenues or operating profit for the location; and (iii) contracts where transaction prices include performance incentives that are based on future performance and therefore cannot be estimated at contract inception. We apply the practical expedient that permits exclusion of information about the remaining performance obligations with original expected durations of one year or less.

The fair values of the interest rate swaps are estimated based on the present value of the difference between expected cash flows calculated at the contracted interest rates and the expected cash flows at current market interest rates using observable benchmarks for the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR forward rates at the end of the period. At October 31, 2024 and 2023, our interest rate swap assets are included in Other noncurrent assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 11, Credit Facility, for further information.

 The estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.

 million to million of exposure on a per-occurrence basis, either through deductibles or self-insured retentions. Beginning November 1, 2023, retentions range between million and million of exposure on a per-occurrence basis. Beyond the retained exposures, we have varying primary policy limits ranging between million and million per occurrence. To cover general liability and automobile liability losses above these primary limits, we maintain commercial umbrella insurance policies that provide aggregate limits of million. Our insurance policies generally cover workers compensation losses to the full extent of statutory requirements. Additionally, to cover property damage risks above our retained limits, we maintain policies that provide per occurrence limits of million. We are also self-insured for certain employee medical and dental plans. We maintain stop-loss insurance for our self-insured medical plan under which we retain up to million of exposure on a per-participant, per-year basis with respect to claims. 
 We maintain our reserves for workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability, and property damage insurance claims based upon known trends and events and the actuarial estimates of required reserves considering the most recently completed actuarial reports. We use all available information to develop our best estimate of insurance claims reserves as information is obtained. The results of actuarial reviews are used to estimate our insurance rates and insurance reserves for future periods and to adjust reserves, if appropriate, for prior years. 
 Insurance Reserve Adjustments 
 Actuarial Reviews and Updates Performed During 2024 
 We review our self-insurance liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust our accruals accordingly. Actual claims activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates used in our reserve liability calculations, we adjust our self-insurance rates and reserves for future periods and, if appropriate, adjust our reserves for claims incurred in prior accounting periods. 
 During the first and third quarters of 2024, we performed comprehensive actuarial reviews of the majority of our casualty insurance programs to evaluate changes made to claims reserves and claims payment activity for the periods of May 1, 2023, through October 31, 2023, and November 1, 2023, through April 30, 2024, respectively (the Actuarial Reviews ). The Actuarial Reviews were comprehensive in nature and were based on loss development patterns, trend assumptions, and underlying expected loss costs during the periods analyzed. 
 During the second and fourth quarters of 2024, we performed interim actuarial updates of the majority of our casualty insurance programs that considered changes in claims development and claims payment activity for the respective periods analyzed (the Interim Updates ). These Interim Updates were abbreviated in nature based on actual versus expected development during the periods analyzed and relied on the key assumptions in the Actuarial Reviews (most notably loss development patterns, trend assumptions, and underlying expected loss costs). 
 Based on the results of the Actuarial Reviews and Interim Updates, w e increased our total reserves related to prior years for known claims as well as our estimate of the loss amounts associated with IBNR Claims during 2024 by million. The adverse development was offset by improvements in other legacy programs. In 2023, we decreased our total reserves related to prior year claims by million.

 million 
 On September 1, 2017, we refinanced and replaced our then-existing million credit facility with a new senior, secured syndicated credit facility, consisting of a million revolving line of credit and an million amortizing term loan, both of which were scheduled to mature on September 1, 2022. In accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility, the revolving line of credit was reduced to million on September 1, 2018. 
 On June 28, 2021, the Company amended and restated the Credit Facility with the Second Amendment, extending the maturity date to June 28, 2026, and increasing the capacity of the revolving credit facility from million to billion and the then remaining term loan outstanding from million to million. The Amended Credit Facility provides for the issuance of up to million for standby letters of credit and the issuance of up to million in swingline advances. The obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are secured on a first-priority basis by a lien on substantially all of our assets and properties, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, we may repay amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Facility at any time without penalty. 
 At November 1, 2022, we amended our Amended Credit Facility pursuant to the LIBOR Transition Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to replace the benchmark rate at which U.S.-dollar-denominated borrowings bear interest from LIBOR to the forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR term rate administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited. As a result of these amendments, we can borrow at Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of subject to a floor of . 
 The Amended Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a maximum total net leverage ratio of to 1.00, a maximum secured net leverage ratio of to 1.00, and a minimum interest coverage ratio of to 1.00, as well as other financial and non-financial covenants. In the event of a material acquisition, as defined in the Amended Credit Facility, we may elect to increase the maximum total net leverage ratio to to 1.00 for a total of four fiscal quarters and increase the maximum secured net leverage ratio to to 1.00 for a total of four fiscal quarters. Our borrowing capacity is subject to, and limited by, compliance with the covenants described above. At October 31, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 The Amended Credit Facility also includes customary events of default, including: failure to pay principal, interest, or fees when due; failure to comply with covenants; the occurrence of certain material judgments; and a change in control of the Company. If certain events of default occur, including certain cross-defaults, insolvency, change in control, or violation of specific covenants, then the lenders can terminate or suspend our access to the Amended Credit Facility, declare all amounts outstanding (including all accrued interest and unpaid fees) to be immediately due and payable, and require that we cash collateralize the outstanding standby letters of credit.

Total deferred financing costs of million, consisting of million related to the term loan and million related to the revolver, are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Amended Credit Facility. 
 Long-Term Loan Maturities 
 During 2024, we made principal payments under the term loan of million. 
 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 We enter into interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our floating-rate, SOFR-based borrowings. Under these arrangements, we typically pay a fixed interest rate in exchange for SOFR-based variable interest throughout the life of the agreement. We initially report the mark-to-market gain or loss on a derivative as a component of AOCL and subsequently reclassify the gain or loss into earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings. Interest payables and receivables under the swap agreements are accrued and recorded as adjustments to interest expense. All of our interest rate swaps have been designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges from inception. See Note 7, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, regarding the valuation of our interest rate swaps.

The aggregate net periodic benefit cost for all Plans was million, million, and million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Future benefit payments in the aggregate are expected to be million. 
 Deferred Compensation Plans 
 We maintain deferred compensation plans that permit eligible employees and directors to defer a portion of their compensation. At October 31, 2024 and 2023, the total liability of all deferred compensation was million and million , respectively, and these amounts are included in Other accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under one of our deferred compensation plans, a Rabbi trust was created to fund the obligations, and we are required to contribute a portion of the deferred compensation contributions for eligible participants. The assets held in the Rabbi trust are not available for general corporate purposes. At October 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of these assets was million and million, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other noncurrent assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Aggregate expense recognized under these deferred compensation plans was million, million, and million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 
 Defined Contribution Plans 
 We sponsor defined contribution plans covering certain employees that are subject to the applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code IRC ). Certain plans permit a company match of a portion of the participant s contributions or a discretionary contribution after the participant has met the eligibility requirements set forth in the plan. During 2024, 2023, and 2022, we made matching contributions required by the plans of million , million, and million, respectively. 
 Multiemployer Pension and Postretirement Plans 
 We participate in various multiemployer pension plans under union and industry-wide agreements that provide defined pension benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Because of the nature of multiemployer plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. In the event another participating employer in a multiemployer plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, including us. In the event of the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or a withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, we could incur material liabilities under applicable law.

 In some instances, we offer clients guaranteed energy savings under certain energy savings contracts. At October 31, 2024 and 2023, total guarantees were million and million, respectively, and these guarantees extend through 2044 and 2043, respectively. We accrue for the estimated cost of guarantees when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not incurred any material losses in connection with these guarantees. 
 Indemnifications 
 We are party to a variety of agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These agreements are primarily standard indemnification arrangements entered into in our ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, we may agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally our clients, in connection with any claims arising out of the services that we provide. We also incur costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements, and in most cases these costs are paid from our insurance program. Although we attempt to place limits on such indemnification arrangements related to the size of the contract, the maximum obligation may not be explicitly stated and, as a result, we are unable to determine the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these arrangements. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may require us to indemnify our directors and officers for certain liabilities that were incurred as a result of their status or service to ABM as a director or officer. The amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. 
 Unclaimed Property Audits 
 We routinely remit escheat payments to states in compliance with applicable escheat laws, and we are subject to unclaimed property audits by states in the ordinary course of business. The property subject to review in the audit process may include unclaimed wages, vendor payments, or customer refunds. State escheat laws generally require entities to report and remit abandoned or unclaimed property to the state, and failure to do so can result in assessments that could include interest and penalties in addition to the payment of the escheat liability. 
 Legal Matters 
 We are a party to a number of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings incident to the operation of our business, including those pertaining to labor and employment, contracts, personal injury, and other matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages. Some of these actions may be brought as class actions on behalf of a class or purported class of employees. 
 At October 31, 2024, the total amount accrued for probable litigation losses where a reasonable estimate of the loss could be made was million. We do not accrue for contingent losses that, in our judgment, are considered to be reasonably possible but not probable. The estimation of reasonably possible losses also requires the analysis of multiple possible outcomes that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties. Our management currently estimates the range of loss for all reasonably possible losses for which a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made is between and million. Factors underlying this estimated range of loss may change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from this estimate. 
 Litigation outcomes are difficult to predict and the estimation of probable losses requires the analysis of multiple possible outcomes that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties. If one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount in excess of, or in a manner different than, what we anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2024. 
 Audit Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting of the Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of its audit, has issued its report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 c. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
 To support the growth of our financial shared service capabilities and standardize our financial systems, we continue to update several key platforms, including our HR information systems, enterprise resource planning system, and labor management system. The implementation of several key platforms involves changes in the systems that include internal controls. During the year ended October, 31 2023, we had a change in our internal control over financial reporting as a result of our implementation of a new ERP system and key boundary systems for the Education industry group that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. At the start of the year ending October 31, 2025, our Business and Industry and Manufacturing and Distribution industry groups migrated to this new ERP system and boundary systems, replacing our legacy systems in which the majority of our business transactions originate, are processed, and recorded. The remaining industry groups will transition to our new ERP system and boundary systems over the next two years. Our new ERP system and boundary systems are intended to provide us with enhanced transactional processing and management tools compared with our legacy systems and are intended to enhance internal controls over financial reporting. We believe our new ERP system and boundary systems will facilitate better transactional reporting and oversight, enhance our internal control over financial reporting, and function as an important component of our disclosure controls and procedures. Although some of the transitions have proceeded to date without material adverse effects, the possibility exists that they could adversely affect our internal controls over financial reporting and procedures. 
 Other than the change of our ERP system and boundary systems for the Education industry group, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year 2024 identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ABM INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED 
 EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN 
 (Effective as of June 4, 2024) 
 
 and 
 
 SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION 

ABM Industries Incorporated 
 Executive Severance Plan (Effective June 4, 2024) 
 and 
 Summary Plan Description 
 Effective as of June 4, 2024, ABM Industries Incorporated (ABM) hereby establishes the ABM Industries Incorporated Executive Severance Plan (the Plan in order to define those circumstances under which ABM or a Participating Company may provide Severance Benefits to Eligible Executives in the event of their Eligible Termination (as such terms are hereinafter defined). The Plan supersedes any and all prior severance plans or programs covering Eligible Executives. 
 
 This document serves as both the Plan document and the Summary Plan Description for the Plan, except as noted otherwise in the Summary Plan Information Appendix. This document explains Plan eligibility, exclusions, benefits and administration. Any questions about the Plan or its operation should be directed to the Plan Administrator. 
 
 SECTION 1 PURPOSE 
 The purpose of this Plan is to define those circumstances under which ABM or a Participating Company may pay Severance Benefits as described in the Plan to Eligible Executives. The Plan is intended to be a top-hat welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA. 
 SECTION 2 DISCRETIONARY GRANT OF SEVERANCE BENEFITS 
 2.1 Any Eligible Executive who has an Eligible Termination and who satisfies the requirements of Section 2.2 below may be eligible to receive Severance Benefits set forth in Section 3 below. Whether Severance Benefits, if any, are to be offered to a terminated Eligible Executive is a matter within the sole and absolute discretion of ABM or a Participating Company. The fact that a termination is an Eligible Termination does not guarantee that severance benefits will be offered. Similarly, the fact that an employee is an Eligible Executive does not mean that severance benefits will be offered. Instead, the decision to offer severance benefits to an Eligible Executive who experiences an Eligible Termination is within the sole and absolute discretion of ABM or a Participating Company. The Plan Administrator, or its delegate, will establish a procedure for notifying Eligible Executives who will be offered Severance Benefits following an Eligible Termination, and only Eligible Executives who are so notified and who are provided a Release will be permitted to receive Severance Benefits under the Plan. 
 2.2 The Plan Administrator will condition any grant of Severance Benefits upon an Eligible Executive s signing (and not revoking) a Release in form and substance satisfactory to the Plan Administrator, and the return of all property of ABM within the time designated by the Plan Administrator. Any grant of Severance Benefits to an Eligible Executive shall be null and void upon an Eligible Executive s failure to timely sign, or subsequent revocation of, such Release, or an Eligible Executive s failure to timely return such property. 
 1 

SECTION 3 DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF SEVERANCE BENEFITS 
 3.1 
 (a) Upon the determination of the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, that an Eligible Executive has satisfied all conditions required to become eligible for Severance Benefits, and the Eligible Executive s termination of employment does not occur within 24 months of a Change in Control, the Eligible Executive will be eligible to receive a Severance Benefit that is equal to the amount set forth in the table below 
 Career Framework Band Level Severance Benefit Minimum Severance Benefit Maximum Severance Benefit E2 and E3 52 weeks of Base Pay plus a payment of the Short-Term Incentive Award with respect to the year in which the Eligible Executive s termination occurs N A N A E1 2 weeks of Base Pay for each Year of Service 26 weeks of Base Pay 52 weeks of Base Pay 
 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, if, for any reason, a Participant becomes entitled to or receives any other severance, separation, notice or termination payments on account of their employment or termination of employment with a Participating Company, including, for example, any payments required to be paid to the Participant under any federal, state or local law (including, without limitation, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or similar federal or state law), their Severance Benefit will be offset by the amount of such other payments paid or payable. 
 3.2 An Eligible Executive who is eligible for Severance Benefits as set forth in Section 3.1 will also receive a cash payment that is equivalent to the Eligible Executive s cost for continuation of group health coverage under COBRA (minus the amount that the Eligible Executive would be required to contribute toward the cost of coverage if the Eligible Executive were an active employee) for the length of time covered by the Eligible Executive s Severance Benefit as set forth in Section 3.1. The amount of such payment will be based on the cost of 
 2

If the extension is required due to the claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide the claim, the 
 6 

period for making the determination will be tolled from the date on which the extension notice is sent to the claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the Plan s request for information. If the claimant is not notified within the 90-day (or, if applicable, extended) period, the claimant may consider the claim to be denied. The Plan Administrator shall have full discretion to deny or grant a claim in whole or in part. 
 8.2 If a claim is denied in whole or in part, or any adverse benefit determination is made with respect to the claim, the claimant will be provided with a written notice setting forth the reason for the determination, along with specific references to the Plan provisions on which the determination is based. This notice will also provide an explanation of what, if any, additional information is needed to evaluate the claim (and why such information is necessary), together with an explanation of the Plan s claims review procedure and the time limits applicable to such procedure, as well as a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review. 
 8.3 If a claim has been denied, or an adverse benefit determination has otherwise been made with respect to the claim, the claimant may request that the Plan Administrator review the denial. The request must be in writing, must be made within 60 days after written notification of denial, and should explain the claimant s disagreement with the denial or adverse benefit determination. In connection with this request, the claimant (or the claimant s duly authorized representative) may (i) be provided, upon written request and free of charge, with reasonable access to (and copies of) all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claim, and (ii) submit to the Plan Administrator written comments, documents, records, and other information related to the claim. 
 8.4 The Plan Administrator s review of the denial will take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information that the claimant submits relating to the claim. The Plan Administrator will make a final written decision on a claim review, in most cases within 60 days after receipt of a request for a review. In some cases, the claim may take more time to review, and an additional processing period of up to 60 days may be required. If that happens, the claimant will receive a written notice of that fact, which will also indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make a determination with respect to the claim. If the extension is required due to the claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide the claim, the period for making the determination will be tolled from the date on which the extension notice is sent to the claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the Plan s request for information. 
 8.5 The Plan Administrator s decision on the claim for review will be communicated to the claimant in writing. If an adverse benefit determination is made with respect to the claim on review, the notice will include (i) the specific reason(s) for any adverse benefit determination, with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the determination is based, (ii) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to (and copies of) all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim, and (iii) a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA.

 8.6 No legal action for benefits under the Plan may be brought until the claims procedure set forth in this Section 8 has been exhausted as provided in this Plan and applicable law. Any such legal action for benefits under the Plan must be brought within 12 months from the date the Plan Administrator denies the claim on review.

SECTION 9 - MISCELLANEOUS 
 9.1 The Plan shall not be construed as creating any contract for continued services between ABM and an Eligible Executive , and nothing herein contained shall give any individual the right to be retained as an employee of ABM. 
 9.2 Benefits payable hereunder shall be paid exclusively from the general assets of ABM, and no person entitled to payment hereunder shall have any claim, right, security interest, or other interest in any fund, trust account, insurance contracts or other asset of ABM. In no event shall benefits payable hereunder be the financial responsibility of any officer or shareholder of ABM or of any successor to ABM who does not assume liabilities hereunder or of any related corporation which may be looked to for such payment. 
 9.3 In the event that an Eligible Executive dies before receiving all Severance Benefits to which they become entitled, any remaining payments shall be paid to such Eligible Executive s estate. 
 9.4 The Plan shall be construed as administered and enforced in accordance with ERISA and, where appropriate, the laws of the State of New York.

Each payment or benefit to be provided under the Plan shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent any payments or benefits payable under the Plan on account of an Eligible Executive s termination of employment constitute a deferral of compensation subject to Code Section 409A, an Eligible Executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment until the Eligible Executive has incurred a separation from service within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if, at the time of an Eligible Executive s termination of employment with ABM, such Eligible Executive is a specified employee (as such term is defined in Section 409A of the Code), and the deferral of the commencement of any payment otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such termination of employment is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then ABM will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments (without any reduction in such payments ultimately paid or provided to such Eligible Executive) until the date that is six months following such Eligible Executive s termination of employment with ABM (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code) or such payment shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner, as determined by the Plan Administrator, that does not cause such an accelerated or additional tax. 
 9.6 ABM shall be entitled to withhold from any payment of Severance Benefits any federal, state or local withholding or other taxes, or charge from time to time required to be withheld, and shall be entitled to rely on the opinion or advice of its counsel in determining its withholding obligations. 
 9.7 If any person receives any payment or benefit that is not authorized by this Plan, ABM shall be entitled to reimbursement of such payment or benefit from any person to whom, or for whom, such payment or benefit was paid. In addition, if following the payment of Severance Benefits to an Eligible Executive, the Plan Administrator discovers that ABM could have terminated such Eligible Executive s employment in manner that would not have been an Eligible Termination (including without limitation a termination of employment for Cause), 
 8 

ABM shall be entitled to reimbursement of such payment from any person to whom, or for whom, such payment was made. In addition, any breach of the Release signed by an Eligible Executive in connection with this Plan shall entitle ABM to reimbursement of the amounts paid pursuant to this Plan. 
 9.8 Each provision of this Plan is intended to be severable and the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any portion of this Plan shall not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of the remainder.

II. STATEMENT OF ERISA RIGHTS 
 
 As a participant in the Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA. ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to 
 
 Receive Information About Your Plan and Benefits 
 
 Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations, such as worksites and union halls, all documents governing the Plan, including collective bargaining agreements, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration. 
 
 Obtain, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents governing the operation of the Plan, including collective bargaining agreements, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and updated summary plan description. The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies. 
 
 Receive a summary of the Plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary annual report. 
 
 Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries 
 
 In addition to creating rights for Plan participants ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan. The people who operate your plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a severance benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. 
 
 Enforce Your Rights 
 
 If your claim for a severance benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. 
 
 Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the plan administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to 110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or Federal court (after you have exhausted the Plan s claims procedure). If you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance 
 APPENDIX -2 

from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. 
 
 Assistance with Your Questions 
 
 If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

 In addition, by signing this Separation Agreement you acknowledge and agree that you are not aware of any actions or inactions by the Company or any of the Released Parties that you believe may constitute bank fraud, wire fraud, securities fraud, any violation of a rule or regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), any violation of federal law, or any violation of the Company s Code of Business Conduct. 
 The above release does not waive claims (i) for vested rights under ERISA-covered employee benefit plans as applicable on the date you sign this Separation Agreement, (ii) that may arise after you sign this Separation Agreement, (iii) which cannot be released by private agreement, or (iv) alleging breach of this Separation Agreement.

If you break this promise, you agree to pay all of the Company s costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) related to the defense of any claims except this promise not to sue stated in this paragraph does not apply to claims that you may have under the OWBPA and the ADEA. 
 Nothing in this Agreement or otherwise limits your ability to communicate directly with and provide information, including documents, not otherwise protected from disclosure by any applicable law or privilege to the SEC or any other federal, state or local governmental agency or commission Government Agency regarding possible legal violations, without disclosure to the Company.

 You agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Separation Agreement or of the restrictive covenants in your Employment Agreement, the Company will have no further obligation to pay or provide any unpaid Separation Benefits and will be entitled to equitable and or injunctive relief and, because the damages for such a breach or threatened breach will be impossible or impractical to determine and will not therefore provide a full and adequate remedy, the Company or ABM-affiliated companies will also be entitled to specific performance by you. Nothing in this Separation Agreement shall limit or prevent the Company from also pursuing any other or additional remedies it may have for breach of any other agreement you may have signed. Despite any breaches, your other obligations under this Separation Agreement will remain in full force and effect. 
 10. Re-Employment

 INSIDER TRADING POLICY 
 
 Including 
 
 1. Trading Window Policy Supplement 
 2. Section 16 Insiders Policy Supplement 
 _______________________________________________________________________ 
 
 What is the purpose of this policy 
 
 This Insider Trading Policy (the Policy provides guidelines with respect to transactions in the securities of ABM Industries Incorporated ABM and the handling of confidential information relating to ABM and its subsidiaries (ABM and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company and the companies with which the Company does business. This Policy promotes compliance with federal and state securities laws that prohibit certain persons who are aware of material nonpublic information about a company from (i) trading in securities of that company or (ii) communicating material nonpublic information to other persons. 
 
 To whom does this policy apply 
 
 This Policy applies to the Company, all officers of the Company, all members of the ABM s Board of Directors and all employees of the Company. The Company may also determine that other persons should be subject to this Policy, such as contractors or consultants who have access to material nonpublic information. This Policy also applies to family members, other members of a person s household and entities controlled by a person covered by this Policy, as described below. 
 
 In addition, certain employees and directors of the Company are subject to supplemental policies. These additional policies are set forth in the Trading Window Policy Supplement and the Section 16 Insiders Policy Supplement. You must read these supplements to determine whether you are subject to their additional restrictions. 

What types of transactions are subject to this policy 
 
 This Policy applies to transactions in the Company s securities. Company securities refer to the common stock of the Company as well as options to purchase common stock and other types of securities that the Company might issue from time to time, as well as exchange-traded put or call options or swaps relating to the Company s securities (collectively referred to in this Policy as Company Securities ). 
 
 What does this mean 
 
 The Company and persons subject to this Policy have ethical and legal obligations to maintain the confidentiality of information about the Company and to not engage in transactions in Company Securities while in possession of material nonpublic information, even if the decision to trade is based on other factors. Each person is responsible for making sure that he or she complies with this Policy, and that any family member, household member or other entity whose transactions are subject to this Policy, as discussed below, also complies with this Policy. In all cases, the responsibility for determining whether an individual is in possession of material nonpublic information rests with that individual, and any action on the part of the Company, or any other employee or director pursuant to this Policy (or otherwise) does not in any way constitute legal advice or insulate an individual from liability under applicable securities laws. You could be subject to severe legal penalties and disciplinary action by the Company for any conduct prohibited by this Policy or applicable securities laws, as described in more detail below under the heading What are the consequences of violating this Policy. 
 
 What is the Policy 
 
 It is the policy of the Company that neither the Company nor any director, officer or other employee of the Company (or any other person subject to this Policy) who is aware of material nonpublic information relating to the Company may, directly or indirectly through family members or other persons or entities 
 
 1. Engage in transactions in Company Securities, except as otherwise specified in this Policy 
 
 2. Recommend the purchase or sale of any Company Securities 
 
 3. Directly or indirectly disclose material nonpublic information to persons within the Company whose jobs do not require them to have that information, or outside of the Company to other persons, including, but not limited to, family, friends, business associates, investors and expert consulting firms, unless any such disclosure is made in accordance with the Company s policies regarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of information regarding the Company or 
 
 4. Assist anyone engaged in the above activities. 
 
 3 

It is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or other employee of the Company (or any other person designated as subject to this Policy) who, in the course of working for the Company, learns of material nonpublic information about a company (1) with which the Company does business, including a customer or supplier of the Company, or (2) that is involved in a potential transaction or business relationship with the Company, may trade in that company s securities until the information becomes public or is no longer material. 
 
 In addition, it is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or other employee of the Company (or any other person designated as subject to this Policy) may trade in another company s securities if such person learns of material nonpublic information about the Company that a reasonable investor could expect to affect such other company s stock price. 
 
 What is the definition of Material Nonpublic Information 
 
 Information is considered material if a reasonable investor would consider that information important in making a decision to buy, hold or sell securities. Any information that could be expected to affect a company s stock price, whether it is positive or negative, could be considered material. There is no bright-line standard for assessing materiality rather, materiality is based on an assessment of all of the facts and circumstances, and is often evaluated by enforcement authorities with the benefit of hindsight. While it is not possible to define all categories of material information, some examples of information that ordinarily would be regarded as material include but are not limited to the following 
 
 Financial condition or results 
 Projections of future earnings or losses, or other earnings guidance 
 Changes to previously announced earnings guidance, or the decision to suspend earnings guidance 
 Unusual gains or losses in major operations 
 A pending or proposed merger, acquisition or tender offer 
 A pending or proposed joint venture 
 A change in dividend policy, the declaration of a stock split, or an offering of additional Company Securities 
 A change in senior management 
 A significant change in a relationship with a key customer 
 A change in auditors or notification that the auditor s reports may no longer be relied upon 
 The establishment, amendment, or termination of a Company repurchase program for Company Securities 
 A significant cybersecurity risk or incident involving the Company s business, including relating to customer, employee or Company data and 
 Pending or threatened significant litigation, or the resolution of such litigation. 
 
 4 

This list of examples is provided solely for the purpose of illustration and is not intended to be all-inclusive. 
 
 All material nonpublic information relating to the Company is the property of the Company and the Company has the sole and exclusive right to determine how and when to disclose such information to the public. Unless specifically authorized by the Company, no person should publicly disclose material nonpublic information, and all such information must be kept strictly confidential. 
 
 When is Information Considered Public 
 
 Information that has not been disclosed to the public is generally considered to be nonpublic information. In order to establish that the information has been disclosed to the public, it may be necessary to demonstrate that the information has been widely disseminated. Information generally would be considered widely disseminated if it has been disclosed through a press release, public disclosure documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC that are available on the SEC s website, or other broad-based means of communication. 
 
 The circulation of rumors, even if accurate and reported in the media, does not constitute effective widespread dissemination. As a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed by the marketplace until after the second full business day after the day on which the information is released. If, for example, ABM were to make an announcement after the commencement of trading on a Monday, directors, officers or other employees must not trade in Company Securities until Thursday (assuming all such days are business days on which the Company s stock is trading). Depending on the particular circumstances, the Company may determine that a longer or shorter period should apply to the release of specific material nonpublic information. 
 
 There are no exceptions to this Policy, except as specifically noted herein. It is important to understand that transactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons (such as the need to raise money for an emergency expenditure), or small transactions, are not excepted from this Policy. The securities laws do not recognize any mitigating circumstances, and, in any event, even the appearance of an improper transaction must be avoided to preserve the Company s reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct. 
 
 The same rule applies to trading in the securities of ABM s suppliers, customers or business partners if you learn inside information about those companies. If you learn, for instance, that a customer is considering a merger, then you cannot trade Company Securities or securities of that company. 

5 

Are transactions by my family or others covered by this Policy 
 
 This Policy applies to your family members who reside with you and anyone else who lives in your household (including a spouse, a child, a child away at college, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents, grandparents, siblings and in-laws), and any family members who do not live in your household but whose transactions in Company Securities are directed by you or are subject to your influence or control, such as parents or children who consult with you before they trade in Company Securities (collectively referred to as Immediate Family Members ). You are responsible for the transactions of these other persons and therefore should make them aware of the need to confer with you before they trade in Company Securities, and you should treat all such transactions for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if the transactions were for your own account. This Policy does not, however, apply to personal securities transactions of Immediate Family Members where the purchase or sale decision is made by a third party not controlled by, influenced by or related to you or your Immediate Family Members. 
 
 This Policy also applies to any entities that you influence or control, including any corporations, partnerships or trusts and transactions by these entities should be treated for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if they were for your own account. 
 
 Are there any exceptions to this Policy for transactions in Company Securities 
 
 There are certain types of transactions that are not covered by this Policy. These are specifically described below 
 
 1. Approved Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans . This Policy does not apply to transactions in Company Securities pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans that (i) have been approved in writing in advance by the ABM General Counsel or his or her designee, (ii) are entered into at a time when not in possession of material nonpublic information concerning ABM and during an open trading window period (as described in the Trading Window Policy Supplement), (iii) comply with SEC Rule 10b5-1, and (iv) meet the requirements of ABM s Rule 10b5-1 Trading Policy. 
 2. Stock Option Exercises. This Policy does not apply to the exercise of an employee or director stock option acquired pursuant to the Company s plans where no stock is sold to pay the exercise price or associated taxes, and the exercise price is paid in cash, except as noted below. 
 
 This Policy does apply, however, to (i) a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option in which the option shares are immediately sold in order to pay the exercise price or associated taxes, (ii) any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option or associated taxes, or (iii) the sale of stock acquired through the exercise of the option. 
 
 6 

3. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans. This Policy does not apply to purchases of Company Securities in the employee stock purchase plan or deferred compensation plans or similar employee benefit plans resulting from your periodic contribution of money to the plan pursuant to the election you made at the time of your enrollment in the plan. This Policy does apply, however, to your election to participate in the plans for any enrollment period (and any changes to such election), to your sales of Company Securities purchased pursuant to the plan. 
 
 4. Dividend Reinvestment Plan. This Policy does not apply to purchases of Company Securities under the Company s dividend reinvestment plan resulting from your reinvestment of dividends paid on Company Securities. 
 
 This Policy does apply, however, to voluntary purchases of Company Securities resulting from additional contributions you choose to make to the dividend reinvestment plan, and to your election to participate in the plan or increase your level of participation in the plan. This Policy also applies to your sale of any Company Securities purchased pursuant to the plan. 
 
 5. Tax Withholding Upon Vesting of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit, or Performance Share Awards, or Exercise of Stock Options . This Policy does not apply to the withholding of shares of ABM common stock by ABM in connection with the payment of tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock unit, or performance share awards, or the exercise of options, where the tax withholding is governed by the terms of the award. 
 
 Can I engage in transactions involving short sales, hedging, puts, calls, margin accounts, pledging of Company Securities or standing or limit orders 
 
 The Company has determined that there is a heightened legal risk and or the appearance of improper or inappropriate conduct if the persons subject to this Policy engage in certain types of transactions. It therefore is the Company s policy that any persons covered by this Policy may not engage in any of the following transactions 
 
 Short Sales . Short sales of Company Securities i.e., the sale of a security that the seller does not own) may evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value, and therefore have the potential to signal to the market that the seller lacks confidence in the Company s prospects. For these reasons, short sales of Company Securities are prohibited. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits officers and directors from engaging in short sales of Company securities. 
 
 Publicly-Traded Options . Given the relatively short-term of publicly-traded options, transactions in options may create the appearance that a director, officer, or employee is trading based on material nonpublic information and focus such person s attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company s long-term objectives. 
 7 

Accordingly, transactions in put options, call options or other derivative securities, on an exchange or in any other organized market, are prohibited by this Policy. 
 
 Hedging Transactions. Hedging or monetization transactions can be accomplished through a number of possible mechanisms, including through the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds or through other transactions that hedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value of Company Securities. Such hedging transactions may permit a director, officer or employee to continue to own Company Securities obtained through employee benefit plans or otherwise, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the director, officer or employee may no longer have the same objectives as the Company s other shareholders. Therefore, directors, officers and employees are prohibited from engaging in any such transactions. 
 
 Margin Accounts and Pledged Securities . Securities held in a margin account as collateral for a margin loan may be sold by the broker without the customer s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Because a margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Company Securities, directors, officers and other employees are prohibited from holding Company Securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging Company Securities as collateral for a loan. 
 
 Does this Policy apply to me after I cease to be an employee, officer or director of the Company 
 
 This Policy continues to apply to transactions in Company Securities even after termination of service to, or employment with, the Company. If an individual is in possession of material nonpublic information when his or her service terminates, that individual may not trade in Company Securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. 
 
 What are the consequences of violating this Policy 
 
 The purchase or sale of securities while aware of material nonpublic information, or the disclosure of material nonpublic information to others who then trade in the Company s Securities, is prohibited by the federal and state laws. Insider trading violations are pursued vigorously by the SEC, U.S. Attorneys and state enforcement authorities. Punishment for insider trading violations is severe and could include significant civil and criminal fines and imprisonment. The federal securities laws also impose potential liability on companies and other controlling persons if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading by Company personnel. In addition, an individual s failure to comply with this Policy may subject the individual to Company imposed sanctions, including dismissal, whether or not the employee s failure to comply results in a violation of law.

 TRADING WINDOW POLICY SUPPLEMENT 
 
 For individuals with frequent knowledge of, or access to, material nonpublic information 
 ________________________________________________________________________ 

This Trading Window Policy Supplement to the Insider Trading Policy is intended to enhance compliance with applicable securities laws by designating blackout periods and open trading windows for individuals with frequent knowledge of or access to material nonpublic information. All provisions of the Insider Trading Policy apply to this Trading Window Policy Supplement. Terms used without definition in this Supplement have the meanings set forth in the Insider Trading Policy. 
 
 To whom does this Trading Window Supplement apply 
 
 This Trading Window Policy Supplement applies to individuals in the Trading Window Group (as defined below) and their Immediate Family Members. 
 
 Am I in the Trading Window Group 
 
 The Trading Window Group consists of employees with frequent knowledge of, or access to, material nonpublic information. Those in the Trading Window Group include 
 
 1. Members of the Company s Board of Directors 
 2. Section 16 Officers 
 3. Designated employees 
 
 The Legal department provides notice to employees on a quarterly basis with respect to whether they are in the Trading Window Group. 

What is the Trading Window Policy 
 
 Regardless of whether a person in the Trading Window Group has material nonpublic information relating to the Company, neither that person nor any Immediate Family Member may engage in transactions in Company Securities outside a designated Trading Window or during a blackout period in which the Trading Window is closed. 
 
 What is the Trading Window and when is it open 
 
 The Trading Window refers to permissible timeframes in which persons in the Trading Window Group may engage in transactions in Company Securities following the Company s quarterly filing on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K. The Trading Window opens on the third business day after the Company s quarterly filing on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K and closes at 4 00 PM ET on the 15 th day of the third month of the Company s fiscal quarter. In other words, the Trading Window Group may not engage in transactions in Company Securities during the blackout period beginning at 4 00 PM ET on the 15 th day of the third month of the Company s fiscal quarter and ending on the third business day after the Company s quarterly filing on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K . For example, as to the Trading Window, if the Company files its Form 10-Q for the third fiscal quarter on September 6 th , the trading window will open on the third business day following September 6 th , and will close at 4 00 PM ET on October 15 th . 
 
 From time to time, an event may occur or information may exist that is material to the Company and is known only by certain directors, officers and or employees. In such a case, an open Trading Window may be closed for an interim period of time for certain persons designated by the Company s General Counsel, Chief Financial Officer or Chief Executive Officer. The existence of an event-specific trading restriction period or extension of a blackout period will not be announced to the Company as a whole, and must not be communicated to any other person. 
 
 The Legal department will periodically remind those in the Trading Window Group of the blackout period and Trading Window period, including any temporary closings of the Trading Window, via e-mail or other notification method. 
 
 What are the consequences of violating the Trading Window Policy 
 
 In addition to any potential liability for illegal insider trading under applicable securities laws, employees of the Company who violate the Trading Window Policy are also subject to disciplinary action by the Company, which may include ineligibility for participation in the Company s equity incentive plans and termination of employment. 

11 

What if I have additional questions 
 
 If you have any questions about these trading restrictions, please contact David Goldman, Vice President and Corporate Secretary at david.goldman abm.com. Mr. Goldman has been designated ABM s Compliance Officer for this policy supplement.

________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 SECTION 16 INSIDERS POLICY SUPPLEMENT 
 
 For non-employee members of the Board of Directors and individuals who have been designated by the ABM Board of Directors as Section 16 Insiders 
 ________________________________________________________________________ 

The purpose of this Section 16 Insiders Policy Supplement to the Insider Trading Policy is to enhance compliance with applicable securities laws by designating trading windows and establishing pre-approval procedures for non-employee directors and Section 16 officers. All provisions of the Insider Trading Policy apply to this Section 16 Insiders Policy Supplement. Terms used without definition in this Section 16 Insiders Policy Supplement have the meanings set forth in the Insider Trading Policy. 
 
 To whom does this Section 16 Insiders Policy Supplement apply 
 
 This Section 16 Insiders Policy Supplement applies to non-employee directors of the ABM Board of Directors and those persons who have been designated by the ABM Board of Directors as persons who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (collectively referred to as Section 16 Insiders ). It also applies to the Immediate Family Members of such persons. 
 
 What is this policy supplement 
 
 Regardless of whether a Section 16 Insider has material nonpublic information relating to the Company, neither that person nor any Immediate Family Member may engage in transactions in Company Securities outside a designated Trading Window or during a blackout period in which the Trading Window is closed. In addition, Section 16 Insiders and their Immediate Family Members may only engage in transactions in Company Securities after receiving pre-approval from the General Counsel or his her designee, as described below. 

Section 16 Insiders must also comply with the reporting obligations and limitations on short-swing transactions set forth in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, described below. 
 
 What is the Trading Window and when is it open 
 
 The Trading Window refers to permissible timeframes in which persons in the Trading Window Group may engage in transactions in Company Securities following the Company s quarterly filing on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K. The Trading Window opens on the third business day after the Company s quarterly filing on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K and closes at 4 00 PM ET on the 15 th day of the third month of the Company s fiscal quarter. In other words, the Trading Window Group may not engage in transactions in Company Securities during the blackout period beginning at 4 00 PM ET on the 15 th day of the third month of the Company s fiscal quarter and ending on the third business day after the Company quarterly filing on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K . For example, as to the Trading Window, if the Company files its Form 10-Q for the third fiscal quarter on September 6 th , the trading window will open on the third business day following September 6 th , and will close at 4 00 PM ET on October 15 th . 
 
 From time to time, an event may occur or information may exist that is material to the Company and is known only by certain directors, officers and or employees. In such a case, an open Trading Window may be closed for an interim period of time for certain persons designated by the Company s General Counsel, Chief Financial Officer or Chief Executive Officer. The existence of an event-specific trading restriction period or extension of a blackout period will not be announced to the Company as a whole, and must not be communicated to any other person. 
 
 Can I use a Rule 10b5-1 plan to trade in Company Securities 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides a defense from insider trading liability under Rule 10b-5. In order to be eligible to rely on this defense, a person subject to this Section 16 Insiders Policy Supplement must enter into a Rule 10b5-1 plan for transactions in Company Securities that meets certain conditions specified in Rule 10b5-1. In addition, any such Rule 10b5-1 plan must comply with the ABM Rule 10b5-1 Trading Policy. If the Rule 10b5-1 plan meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and the ABM Rule 10b5-1 Trading Policy, Company Securities may be purchased or sold under the Rule 10b5-1 plan without regard to certain insider trading restrictions. Any Rule 10b5-1 plan (and amendments thereto) must be approved by the Company s General Counsel or his her designee prior to the entry into the Rule 10b5-1 plan. 
 
 What are the consequences of violating this supplemental policy 
 
 In addition to the consequences described in the Insider Trading Policy, there are additional consequences to violating this Section 16 Insiders Policy Supplement. Under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 16 Insiders who purchase and 
 14 

sell, or sell and purchase, the Company s Securities within a six-month time period must disgorge all profits from these transactions to the Company, whether or not they had knowledge of material nonpublic information at the time of the transactions. 
 
 What is the process for seeking pre-approval 
 
 All transactions involving Company Securities by Section 16 Insiders as well as their Immediate Family Members are subject to pre-approval by the General Counsel or his her designee (and any proposed transaction by the General Counsel and any of his or her Immediate Family Members must also be submitted to the Company s Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer for pre-approval). Pre-approval requests may be transmitted by phone, via email, fax or hard copy. A request for pre-clearance should be submitted to the General Counsel or his her designee (or other applicable person) at least one business day in advance of the proposed transaction. The General Counsel or his her designee will review the circumstances of the proposed trade, taking into consideration any pending material events or other material information regarding the Company that has not yet been publicly disclosed, including with respect to any anticipated or currently-operative repurchase programs for Company Securities. The General Counsel or his her designee (or other applicable person) is under no obligation to approve a transaction submitted for pre-clearance, and may determine not to permit the transaction. If the General Counsel or his her designee (or other applicable person) does not respond to a request for pre-clearance, the request will be deemed to have been denied. If a person seeks pre-clearance and permission to engage in the transaction is denied or not responded to, then he or she should refrain from initiating any transaction in Company Securities, and should not inform any other person of the restriction. 
 
 When a request for pre-clearance is made, the requestor should carefully consider whether he or she may be aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company, and should describe fully those circumstances to the General Counsel or his her designee (or other applicable person). The requestor should also indicate whether he or she has effected any non-exempt opposite-way transactions within the past six months. 
 
 If permission to engage in the transaction is granted, then the transaction must be initiated within five business days of receipt of pre-clearance, unless an exception is granted or the person becomes aware of material nonpublic information before the trade is executed, in which case the preclearance is void and the trade must not be completed. If transactions are not effected within the time limit, pre-clearance must be requested and approved again. 
 
 What reporting requirements apply to Section 16 Insiders 
 
 In addition to seeking pre-approval for all transactions involving Company Securities, Section 16 Insiders are also required to report (or cause to be reported) to the General Counsel or his her designee any transaction in Company Securities by themselves or any 
 15 

Immediate Family Member on the day which the transaction occurs. Each report should include the date of the transaction, quantity of securities, price and broker-dealer through which the transaction was effected. Each Section 16 Insider is also responsible for assuring that, if required, a Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with any transaction involving a sale of Company Securities. 
 
 The pre-approval process is designed to help monitor compliance with Company policies relating to insider trading, including this Section 16 Insiders Policy Supplement, and to enable the Company to assist Section 16 Insiders with their reporting obligations under the Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, each Section 16 Insider, and not the Company, is personally responsible for confirming that his her transactions are timely reported and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not give rise to short swing liability under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
 Do the trading restrictions set forth in this Supplement continue after I cease to be a Section 16 Insider 
 
 This Section 16 Insiders Policy Supplement will continue to apply to transactions in Company Securities even after a Section 16 Insider has resigned, ceased to be named a Section 16 Insider by the ABM Board of Directors, has been terminated or has otherwise ended his her relationship with the Company. If a Section 16 Insider is in possession of material nonpublic information when his or her service terminates, that Section 16 Insider may not engage in transactions in Company Securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. The pre-approval procedures specified above, however, will cease to apply to transactions in Company Securities upon the expiration of any blackout period or other Company-imposed trading restrictions applicable at the time of the termination of service. 
 
 What if I have additional questions 
 
 If you have any questions about these trading restrictions, please contact David Goldman, Vice President and Corporate Secretary at david.goldman abm.com. Mr. Goldman has been designated ABM s Compliance Officer for this policy supplement.
