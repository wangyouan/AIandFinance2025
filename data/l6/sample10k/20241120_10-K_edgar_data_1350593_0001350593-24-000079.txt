completed our large valve manufacturing expansion in Chattanooga, Tennessee and a new facility in Kimball, Tennessee, which included consolidating multiple facilities. Additionally, our new brass foundry in Decatur, Illinois is operational, and in the first half of our fiscal 2025, we expect to close our old brass foundry which was built in the early 1900s. We expect these investments to support our domestic manufacturing capabilities for specialty and large valves and to capitalize on the growing need for highly engineered valves required for water infrastructure projects. Additionally, we expect these investments to drive operational efficiencies, expand capabilities for American-made products, advance our sustainability environmental initiatives, and help accelerate product development. 
 Accelerate sales growth through enhanced customer experience and innovation. 
 We plan to continue to invest in process improvements to support our objective of being the preferred partner for our customers. We are making disciplined investments in our commercial teams to enhance our customer experience to further differentiate us in the market and support our opportunities for net sales growth. Expanding our systems and employee capabilities will allow us to improve our customer experience. We continue to invest time and resources to deepen our channel partnerships end-customer relationships to increase our presence in the fastest-growing markets. Additionally, we seek to attract and retain customers through product training and engineering resources to ascertain, educate and understand project requirements. We plan to continue to invest in our product development capabilities, including our research and development processes, to develop and market new products and services. We expect to add new products to our portfolio and offer new products in different end markets. 
 Foster culture through purpose, collaboration, inclusion and effectiveness. 
 We believe our employees are our greatest asset, and we strive to provide a safe, inclusive, high-performance culture where our people can thrive. We endeavor to recruit, develop, engage, train and protect our workforce. Our core values of respect, integrity, trust, safety and inclusion shape our culture and define who we are. We are making investments to enhance collaboration and teamwork throughout the organization to create a culture of talent development, enabling us to execute on our strategic opportunities and make Mueller a preferred place to work. We prioritize employee engagement and transparency by implementing programs and processes to provide our employees with opportunities to ask questions, voice concerns and share feedback. This communication is accomplished in part by conducting employee satisfaction surveys, global town halls and facility employee meetings. 
 Continue to seek, acquire, and invest in businesses and technologies that expand our existing portfolio or allow us to enter new markets. 
 We will continue to evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses, technologies and product lines that have the potential to strengthen our competitive position, enhance or expand our existing product and service offerings, expand our technological capabilities, leverage our manufacturing capabilities, provide synergistic opportunities, enhance our customer relationships or allow us to enter new markets. As part of this strategy, we have pursued, and may continue to pursue, international opportunities, including acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships.

 , leak detection and pressure control products 
 Water Flow Solutions 
 Water Flow Solutions product portfolio includes iron gate valves, specialty valves and service brass products. We recognized 755.5 million, 634.4 million and 714.1 million of net sales in our 2024, 2023 and 2022 fiscal years, respectively, for Water Flow Solutions products and solutions.

Water Valves and Related Products. Water Flow Solutions manufactures valves for water systems, including iron gate, butterfly, tapping, check, knife, plug, and ball valves, and sells these products under a variety of brand names, including Mueller , Pratt , and U.S. Pipe Valve and Hydrant. These valve products are used to control distribution and transmission of potable water and non-potable water. Water valve products typically range in size from inch to 36 inches in diameter. Water Flow Solutions also manufactures significantly larger valves as custom orders through some of its product lines. Most of these valves are used in water transmission or distribution, water treatment facilities or industrial applications. 
 Water Management Solutions 
 Water Management Solutions portfolio includes fire hydrants, repair and installation, natural gas, metering, leak detection and pressure management and control products and solutions. We recognized 559.2 million, 641.3 million and 533.3 million of net sales in our 2024, 2023, and 2022 fiscal years respectively, for Water Management Solutions products and solutions. 
 
 Fire Hydrants. Water Management Solutions manufactures dry-barrel and wet-barrel fire hydrants. Water Management Solutions sells fire hydrants for new water infrastructure development, fire protection systems and water infrastructure repair and replacement projects. 
 Our fire hydrants consist of an upper barrel and nozzle section and a lower barrel and valve section that connect to a water main. In dry-barrel fire hydrants, the valve connecting the barrel of the hydrant to the water main is located below ground at or below the frost line, which keeps the upper barrel dry. Water Management Solutions sells dry-barrel fire hydrants under the Mueller and U.S. Pipe Valve and Hydrant brand names in the United States and Mueller and the Canada Valve brand names in Canada. Water Management Solutions also makes wet-barrel fire hydrants, where the valves are located in the hydrant nozzles and the barrel contains water at all times. Wet-barrel fire hydrants are made for warm weather climates, such as in California and Hawaii, and are sold under the Jones brand name. 
 Most municipalities have approved a limited number of fire hydrant brands for installation as a result of their desire to use the same tools and operating instructions across their systems and to minimize spare part inventories. We believe the large installed base of Mueller fire hydrants throughout the United States and Canada, reputation for superior quality and performance as well as specified position have contributed to the leading market position of our fire hydrants. This large installed base also leads to recurring sales of replacement fire hydrants and hydrant parts. 
 Repair Products and Services. Water Management Solutions also sells pipe repair products, such as couplings, grips and clamps used to repair leaks, under the HYMAX , Mueller and Krausz brand names. 
 Natural Gas Distribution Products . Water Management Solutions produces machines and tools for tapping, drilling, extracting, installing and stopping-off, which are designed to work with its water and gas fittings and valves as an integrated system. We also provide gas valve products primarily for use in gas distribution systems. 
 Water Leak Detection and Pipe Condition Assessment Products and Services . Water Management Solutions develops technologies and offers products and services under the Echologics brand name that can non-invasively (i.e., without disrupting service or introducing a foreign object into the water system) detect underground leaks and assess the condition of water mains comprised of a variety of materials. We leverage our proprietary acoustic technology to offer leak detection and condition assessment surveys. We also offer fixed leak detection systems that allow customers to continuously monitor and detect leaks on water distribution and transmission mains. We believe Water Management Solutions ability to offer non-invasive leak detection and pipe condition assessment services is a key competitive advantage. With our Singer Valve and i2O products, we provide a range of intelligent water solutions including pressure control valves, advanced pressure management, network analytics, event management and data logging. 
 Water Metering Products and Systems . Water Management Solutions manufactures and sources a variety of water technology products under the Mueller brand name that are designed to help water providers accurately measure and control water usage. Water Management Solutions offers residential, fire protection and commercial metering solutions. Residential and commercial water meters are generally classified as either manually read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology. A manually read meter consists of a water meter and a register that gives a visual meter reading display. Meters equipped with radio transmitters (endpoints) use encoder registers to convert the measurement data from the meter (mechanical or static) into an encrypted digital format which is then transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility billing systems. These remotely or electronically read systems are either automatic meter reading AMR systems or fixed network advanced metering infrastructure AMI systems. With an AMR system, utility personnel with mobile equipment, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collect the data from utilities meters. With an AMI system, a network of permanent data collectors or gateway receivers that are always active or listening 
 3

 Index to Financial Statements 

for the radio transmission from the utilities meters gathers the data. Water Management Solutions sells both AMR and AMI systems and related products. Our remote disconnect water meter enables the water flow to be stopped and started remotely via a handheld device or from a central operating facility. 

Manufacturing 
 See Item 2. PROPERTIES for a description of our principal manufacturing facilities. 
 We will continue to expand the use of Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma business process improvement methodologies where appropriate to safely capture higher levels of quality, service and operational efficiency in our manufacturing facilities in both segments. 
 Mueller Water Products operates ten manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Israel and China. These manufacturing operations include foundry, machining, fabrication, assembly, testing and painting operations. Not all facilities perform each of these operations. Our existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient for anticipated near-term requirements. To meet longer-term capacity requirements and modernize some production facilities, we have expanded the large valve casting capabilities at the facility located in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and added a new facility nearby in Kimball, Tennessee to expa nd domestic manufacturing capabilities for specialty large valves. Additionally, our new brass foundry in Decatur, Illinois, is operational and in the first half of our fiscal 2025, we expect to close our old brass foundry that was built in the 1900s. Our foundries use both lost foam and green sand-casting techniques. We use the lost foam technique for fire hydrant production in our Albertville, Alabama facility and for iron gate valve production in our Chattanooga, Tennessee facility. The lost foam technique has several advantages over the green sand technique, especially for high-volume products, including a reduction in the number of manual finishing operations, lower scrap rates and the ability to reuse some of the materials. 
 
 Additionally, we design, manufacture, and assemble water metering products in Cleveland, North Carolina. In Atlanta, Georgia, we design and support AMR and AMI systems in our research and development center of excellence for software and electronics. Our research and development center in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, designs and supports leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and solutions. Product design and support for our intelligent water solutions products and services for pressure management are in Southampton, United Kingdom. 

Purchased Components and Raw Materials 
 Our products are made using various purchased components and seve ral basic raw materials that include brass ingot, scrap steel, sand and resin. Purchased parts and raw materials represented approxi mately 35 and 9 , respectively, of Cost of sales in 2024. 

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks 
 We have active patents relating to the design of our products and trademarks for our brands and products. We have filed, and continue to file when appropriate, patent applications used in connection with our business and products. Many of the patents for technology underlying the majority of our products have been in the public domain for many years, and we do not believe third-party patents individually or in the aggregate are material to our business. However, we consider the pool of proprietary information consisting of expertise and trade secrets relating to the design, manufacture and operation of our products to be particularly important and valuable. We generally own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell, and we are not dependent in any material way upon any third-party license or franchise to operate. See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Any inability to protect our intellectual property or our failure to effectively defend against intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our competitive position.

Seasonality 
 Parts of our business depend upon construction activity, which is seasonal in many areas as a result of the impact of cold weather conditions on construction. Net sales and operating income have historically been lowest in the quarters ending December 31 and March 31 when the northern United States and most of Canada generally face weather conditions that restrict significant construction and other field crew activity. See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Seasonal demand for certain of our products and services may adversely affect our financial results. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 We primarily sell to national and regional waterworks distributors in the United States and Canada. Our distributor relationships are generally non-exclusive, but we attempt to align ourselves with key distributors in the principal markets we serve. We believe Mueller is the most recognized brand in the United States water infrastructure industry. Our extensive installed base, broad product range and well-known brands have led to many long-standing relationships with the key distributors in the principal markets we serve. Our distribution network covers all of the major locations for our principal products in the United States and Canada. Although we have long-standing relationships with most of our key distributors, we typically do not have long-term contracts with them, including our two largest distributors, which together accounted for approxim ately 38 , 35 and 40 of our gross sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022 fiscal years, respectively . See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales. 
 Water Flow Solutions 
 Water Flow Solutions sells its products primarily through waterworks distributors to a wide variety of end user customers, including water and wastewater utilities, and fire protection and constructi on contractors. Sales of the products are heavily influenced by the specifications for the underlying projects. Approximately 6 of Water Flow Solutions net sales were to Canadian customers in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, and 8 in fiscal year 2022. 
 Water Management Solutions 
 Water Management Solutions sells its products primarily through waterworks distributors to a wide variety of end user customers, including water and wastewater utilities, gas utilities, integrated suppliers, as well as fire protection and construction contractors. Sales of our products are heavily influenced by the specifications for the underlying projects. Water Management Solutions also sells its water metering, leak detection, including pipe condition assessment, and pressure management and control products and solutions directly to municipalities and to waterworks distributors. Approximate ly 6 of Water Management Solutions net sales were to Canadian customers in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, and 7 in fiscal year 2022. 

Backlog 
 We consider backlog to represent orders placed by customers for which goods or services have yet to be shipped. Backlog is a meaningful indicator for many of our product lines. The delivery lead time for certain product lines such as specialty valves

can be longer than one year, and we expect approximately 17 of Water Flow Solutions backlog at the end of 2024 will not be shipped until beyond 2025. Water Management Solutions manufactures or sources water meter systems that are sometimes ordered in large quantities with delivery dates over several years. We expect approximately 6 of Water Management Solutions backlog at the end of 2024 will not be shipped until beyond 2025. With improvement in our manufacturing lead times, particularly for service brass products, we experienced a decrease in our overall backlog compared to the prior year. Backlog for Water Management Solutions and Water Flow Solutions are as follows: 
 
 September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Water Flow Solutions 199.0 232.0 Water Management Solutions 103.5 93.5 Total backlog 302.5 325.5 
 
 Sales cycles for metering systems can span several years, and it is common for customers to place orders throughout the contract period. Although we believe we have a common understanding with our customer as to the total value of a contract when it is awarded, we do not include customer orders in our backlog until the customer order is received. 

Competition 
 The United States and Canadian markets for water infrastructure and flow control products are very competitive. See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. There are only a few competitors for most of our product and service offerings. Many of our competitors are well-established companies with products that have strong brand recognition. We consider our installed base, product quality, customer service level, brand recognition, innovation, distribution and technical support to be competitive strengths. 
 The competitive environment for most of Water Flow Solutions valve products is mature and many end users are slow to transition to brands other than their historically preferred brands making it difficult to increase market share. We believe our valves enjoy strong competitive positions based primarily on the extent of their installed base, product quality, specified position and brand recognition. Our principal competitors for iron gate valves are McWane, Inc. and American Cast Iron Pipe Company. The primary competitors for our service brass products are The Ford Meter Box Company, Inc. and A.Y. McDonald Mfg. Co. Many service brass valves are interchangeable among different manufacturers. For our specialty valve products such as butterfly, plug, and check valves, our principal competitors are DeZURIK, Val-Matic and McWane, Inc. 
 The markets for products and services sold by Water Management Solutions are very competitive, with some mature products, and many end users are slow to transition to brands other than their historically preferred brands. We believe that our fire hydrants enjoy a strong competitive position primarily based on the extent of their installed base, product quality, specified position and brand recognition. Our principal competitors for fire hydrants are McWane, Inc. and American Cast Iron Pipe Company. We believe the markets for many of our repair products are open to product innovation. For our pipe repair products, we believe our brand names, including Krausz and HYMAX , are generally associated with premium products as a result of our patented technology and superior features. Our current marketing strategy is primarily focused on repair, joining and restraining of water infrastructure piping systems, which consists of cast iron, ductile iron and plastic pipe. Our repair solutions work well with each of these piping systems. Our primary competitors in the repair market are Romac Industries, Smith Blair, Viking Johnson, AVK Group, JCM Industries, and Georg Fisher Ltd.

The gas repair products we sell are primarily used on distribution lines. Our primary competitors for these products are Smith Blair, T.D. Williamson, and A.Y. McDonald. Water Management Solutions also sells water metering products and systems, primarily in the United States. We believe a substantial portion of this market is in the process of transitioning from manually read meters to electronically read meters; however, we expect this transition to be relatively slow and that many end users will be reluctant to adopt brands other than their historically preferred brand. Our principal competitors are Sensus, Neptune Technology Group Inc., Badger Meter, Inc., Itron, Inc., and Master Meter, Inc. We also sell pressure control valves and pressure loggers through our Singer Valve and i2O products. The primary competitors for these products are Cla-Val, Watts, OCV, Ross Valve, Bermad and Halma. Additionally, Water Management Solutions sells water leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services in North America, the United Kingdom and select countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, with our primary markets being the United States and Canada. The worldwide market for leak detection and pipe condition assessment is highly fragmented with numerous competitors. Our more significant competitors are Pure Technologies Ltd., Gutermann AG and Syrinix Ltd. 

Research and Development 
 Our primary research and development R D facilities are located in Chattanooga, Tennessee; Rosh Haayin, Israel; Atlanta, Georgia; Toronto, Ontario; and Southampton, United Kingdom. The primary focus of these operations is to develop new products, improve and refine existing products and obtain and assure compliance with industry approval certifications or standards, such as AWWA, UL, FM, NSF and The Public Health and Safety Company. R D expenses were 20.5 million, 25.9 million and 24.5 million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Regulatory and Environmental Matters 
 Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in areas such as: competition, government contracts, international trade, labor and employment, tax, licensing, consumer protection, environmental protection, workplace health and safety, and others. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA and similar state laws affect our operations by, among other things, imposing investigation and cleanup requirements for threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, joint and several liability may be imposed on operators, generators, site owners, lessees and others regardless of fault or the legality of the original activity that caused or resulted in the release of the hazardous substances. Thus, we may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws for properties that: (1) we currently own, lease or operate; (2) we, our predecessors, or former subsidiaries previously owned, leased or operated; (3) sites to which we, our predecessors or former subsidiaries sent waste materials; and (4) sites at which hazardous substances from our facilities operations have otherwise come to be located. The purchaser of U.S. Pipe has been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP under CERCLA in connection with a former manufacturing facility operated by U.S. Pipe that was in the vicinity of a Superfund site located in North Birmingham, Alabama. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to our sale of U.S. Pipe, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain environmental liabilities, including those arising out of the former manufacturing site in North Birmingham. Accordingly, the purchaser tendered the matter to us for indemnification, which we accepted. Ultimate liability for the site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined, including the determination of the Environmental Protection Agency s EPA remediation costs, the number and financial viability of the other PRPs (there are three other PRPs currently) and the determination of the final allocation of the costs among the PRPs. For more information regarding this matter as well as others that may affect our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, see Item 1A. RISK FACTORS, Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies and Note 15. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. We believe our operations are in compliance with, or we are taking actions designed to reinforce compliance with, these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or standards, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with those claims. Except for certain orders issued by environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies, with which we believe we are in compliance and which we believe are immaterial to our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, we are not currently named as a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to environmental, health and safety matters.

Greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions have increasingly become the subject of political and regulatory focus. Concern over potential climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting GHG emissions. In addition to certain federal proposals in the United States to regulate GHG emissions, many states and countries have enacted, are enacting or are considering enacting GHG legislation, regulations or international accords, either individually and/or as part of regional initiatives. It is likely that additional climate change related mandates will be forthcoming, and it is expected that they may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices, requiring operational or equipment modifications to reduce emissions and creating costs to comply with regulations or to mitigate the financial consequences of such compliance. 
 
 Our environmental strategy focuses on responsible sourcing and manufacturing sustainable products that address numerous water infrastructure challenges. We have established reduction targets for key environmental performance indicators such as GHG emissions, internal water withdrawal intensity and waste to landfill, as well as targets for increased use of recycled materials in our products. In connection with these efforts, we work to minimize the amount of water we use at our manufacturing facilities and maintain stringent water quality standards. Our processes are designed to return the water used in manufacturing to a quality level that does not negatively impact the receiving environment. 
 
 Future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, new legislation to limit GHG emissions or contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us, including currently unknown contamination and contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators, may give rise to additional costs which could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 Our anticipated capital expenditures for environmental projects are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

Human Capital 
 We believe our employees are our greatest asset, and we endeavor to provide a safe, inclusive, high-performance culture where our people can thrive. We strive to recruit, develop, engage, train and protect our workforce. The following are key human capital measures and objectives on which the Company currently focuses. 
 Core Values. Our core values of respect, integrity, trust, safety and inclusion shape our culture and define who we are. We are committed to upholding fundamental human rights and believe that all human beings should be treated with dignity, fairness, and respect.

 Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. We strive to promote inclusion in the workplace, to build on our understanding of potential human rights issues by engaging with appropriate communities, and to interact with our employees and all communities in a manner that respects human rights. We encourage our suppliers to follow these practices as well. As of September 30, 2024, women and minorities each represented 36 of our Board of Directors. 
 
 We condemn human rights abuses and do not condone the use of slave or forced labor, human trafficking, child labor, the degrading treatment of individuals, physical punishment, or unsafe working conditions. 
 
 All employees are required to understand and obey local laws, to report any suspected violations, and to act in accordance with our Core Values and Code of Conduct. 
 
 We are committed to providing fair and equitable pay. In 2021, we completed a pay equity analysis to ensure we met this commitment. Based on the results of this analysis, we introduced a comprehensive, pay structure and promotion program. In 2024, we invested in a leading software solution to conduct workforce pay equity audits that consider gender, race/ethnicity, age, and disabilities. We believe this program will provide us with the ability to conduct ad hoc and annual pay equity audits. 
 
 We have a series of Diversity and Inclusion D I councils including an executive council, a company-wide employee council, local employee councils at each manufacturing facility, a corporate council and a sales team council. 
 
 Talent Acquisition and Retention. We strive to attract, develop and retain high-performing talent, and we support and reward employee performance. Programs to strengthen our talent include an employee referral program, tuition reimbursement, continued training and development and succession planning. We also have partnerships with local and national educational institutions for our recruiting efforts. We prioritize employee engagement and transparency by implementing programs and processes to ensure our employees have opportunities to ask questions, voice concerns, and share feedback. This communication is accomplished in part by conducting an annual employee satisfaction survey, global quarterly town halls and periodic facility employee meetings. Our fiscal year 2024 United States employee turnover rate was approximately 22 . 
 
 Leadership and Culture Development. As new generations enter the workforce, their dedication to sustainability is pivotal for our long-term prosperity. We created the Mueller Development Program MDP to provide a pathway for upcoming talent. We offer a Frontline Leader training program, which includes resources in time management, communication, team building, as well as personal coaching.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Risks related to our industries 
 A significant portion of our business depends on spending for water and wastewater infrastructure construction activity. 
 Our primary end markets are repair and replacement of water infrastructure, driven by municipal spending and new water infrastructure installation driven by new residential construction. As a result, a significant portion of our business depends on local, state and federal spending on water and wastewater infrastructure upgrade, repair and replacement. Funds for water and wastewater infrastructure repair and replacement typically come from local taxes, water fees and water rates. State and local governments and private water entities that do not adequately budget for expenditures when setting tax rates, water rates and water fees, as applicable, could be unable to pay for water infrastructure repair and replacement if they do not have access to other funding sources. In addition, reductions or delays in federal spending related to water or wastewater infrastructure could adversely affect state or local projects and thus may adversely affect our financial results. 
 Governments and private water entities may have limited abilities to increase taxes, water fees or water rates, as applicable. It is not unusual for water and wastewater projects to be delayed and rescheduled for a number of reasons, including changes in project priorities, increasing interest rates, inflation and difficulties in complying with environmental and other governmental regulations. For example, changes in interest rates and credit markets, including municipal bonds, mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, have in the past, and may in the future, significantly increase the cost of the projects in which our products are utilized, such as in new residential construction and water and wastewater infrastructure upgrade, repair and replacement projects, and lead to such projects being reduced, delayed and/or rescheduled, which could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings and adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, higher interest rates are often accompanied by inflation. We have in the past, and may in the future, be unable to raise the prices of our products sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and cash flows. 
 Some state and local governments may place significant restrictions on the use of water by their constituents and/or increase their water conservation efforts. These types of water use restrictions and water conservation efforts may lead to reduced water revenues by private water entities, municipalities or other governmental agencies, which could similarly affect funding decisions for water-related projects. 
 Poor economic conditions may cause states, municipalities or private water entities to receive lower than anticipated revenues, which may lead to reduced or delayed funding for water infrastructure projects. Even if favorable economic conditions exist, water infrastructure owners may choose not to address deferred infrastructure needs as a result of a variety of political factors or competing spending priorities. 
 
 Low levels of spending for water and wastewater infrastructure construction activity could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows. 
 Residential construction activity is important to our business and adverse conditions or sustained uncertainty within this market could adversely affect our financial results. 
 New water and wastewater infrastructure spending is heavily dependent upon residential construction. As a result, our financial performance depends significantly on the stability and growth of the residential construction market. This market depends on a variety of factors beyond our control, including household formation, consumer confidence, interest rates, inflation and the availability of mortgage financing, as well as the mix between single and multifamily construction, availability of construction labor and ultimately the extent to which new construction leads to the development of raw land. Adverse conditions or sustained uncertainty regarding the residential construction market have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our sales, profitability and cash flows, including the risk that one or more of our distributors and/or end use customers decide to delay purchasing, or determine not to purchase, our products or services. 
 Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales. 
 A majority of our products are sold primarily to distributors and our success depends on these third parties operating their businesses profitably and effectively. These distributors profitability and effectiveness can vary significantly from company to company and from region to region within the same company. Further, our largest distributors generally also carry competing products. We may fail to align our operations with successful distributors in any given market. 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

Distributors in our industry have experienced consolidation. If such consolidation continues, our distributors could be acquired by other distributors who have better relationships with our competitors, and consequently, pricing and profit margin pressure may intensify. Pricing and profit margin pressure or the loss of any one of our key distributors in any market could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Certain products and solutions, primarily technology-enabled products and solutions, as well as gas repair products are sold directly to end users. Some of these customers represent a relatively high concentration of these sales. Over time, growth in sales is expected to lessen the significance of individual customers. In the short term, net sales could decline if existing significant customers do not continue to purchase our products or services and new customers are not obtained to replace them. 
 Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 The United States and Canadian markets for water infrastructure and flow control products are very competitive. While there are only a few competitors for most of our product and service offerings, many of our competitors are well-established companies with strong brand recognition. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including the quality, price and innovation of our products, services and service levels, and product specifications and availability. Our ability to retain customers in the face of competition depends on our ability to market our products and services to our customers and end users effectively. 
 The United States markets for water metering products and systems are highly competitive. Our primary competitors benefit from strong market positions and many end users are slow to transition to new products or new brands. Our ability to attract new customers depends on our technological advancements and ability to market our products and services to our customers and end users effectively. 
 In addition to competition from North American companies, we face the threat of competition from outside of North America. The intensity of competition from these companies is affected by fluctuations in the value of the United States dollar against foreign local currencies, the cost to ship competitive products into North America and the availability of trade remedies, if any. Competition may also increase as a result of competitors located in the United States shifting their operations to lower-cost countries or otherwise reducing their costs. 
 Our competitors may reduce the prices of their products or services, improve their quality, improve their functionality or enhance their marketing or sales activities. Any of these potential developments could adversely affect our prices and demand for our products and services. 
 The long-term success of our newer systems and solutions, including the related products, software and services, such as smart metering, leak detection, pressure monitoring and pipe condition assessment, depends on market acceptance. 
 Our technology-enabled smart metering, leak detection, pressure monitoring and pipe condition assessment products and services have much less market history than many of our traditional products. Our investments in smart metering have primarily focused on the market for AMI and have been based on our belief that water utilities will transition over time from traditional manually-read meters to automatically-read meters. The market for AMI continues to evolve, and the United States markets for water meter products and systems are highly competitive. Water utilities have traditionally been slow adopters of new technology and may not adopt AMI as quickly as we expect, partially as a result of the substantial investment related to installation of AMI systems. The strong market positions of our primary competitors may also slow the adoption of our products. Similarly, the adoption of our pressure monitoring, leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services depends on the willingness of our customers to invest in new product and service offering s, and the pace of adoption may be slower than we expe ct. The markets for our technology-enabled products and services have developed more slowly than we expected and may continue to do so. If these products and services fail to gain market acceptance, our opportunity to grow these businesses will be limited. 
 Risks related to our business strategy 
 We may not be able to adequately manage the risks associated with our products and systems, including increased warranty costs. 
 The success of our products and systems depends on our ability to manage the risks associated with their introduction and continued maintenance and management, including the risk that our products and systems may have quality or other defects or deficiencies that result in their failure to satisfy performance or reliability requirements. Our success depends in part on our ability to manage these risks, including costs associated with design, manufacturing, installation, maintenance and warranties. Managing these risks can be costly and technologically challenging, and we cannot determine the ultimate effect they may 
 12 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

have. Warranty liabilities and the related reserve estimation process is highly judgmental as a result of the complex nature of these exposures and the unique circumstances of each claim. Furthermore, once claims are asserted for an alleged product defect by customers, it can be difficult to determine the level of potential exposure or liability related to such allegation or the extent to which the assertion of these claims may expand geographically. Although we maintain insurance for certain product related claims, such policies may not be available to us or adequately cover the liability for damages, the cost of repairs and/or the expense of litigation. Current and future claims may arise out of events or circumstances not covered by insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our subcontractors. Failure to successfully manage these challenges could result in lost sales, significant expense and harm to our reputation. 
 Our products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the business and result in harm to our reputation. 
 We offer several technologically enhanced, complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Unanticipated defects can also exist in components and products we purchase from third parties. Component defects could make our products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. In addition, our offerings can have quality issues and from time-to-time experience outages, disruptions, slowdowns or errors. As a result, our products and services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services we offer. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting our offerings. In addition, we can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for our customers and result in harm to our reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, new product and service introduction delays and lost sales. 
 Inefficient or ineffective capital allocation, along with increased capital expenditures to modernize our aging facilities and expand our capabilities, could adversely affect, among other things, our operating results, cash availability, strategic opportunities and/or stockholder value. 
 Our goal is to invest capital to generate long-term value for our stockholders. This includes spending on capital projects; developing or acquiring strategic businesses; technologies and product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position; enhancing our existing set of product and service offerings or entering into new markets; as well as periodically returning value to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. To a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage key risks. The actions taken to address specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. If we do not allocate properly and manage our capital, we may fail to produce expected financial results, and we may experience a reduction in stockholder value, including increased volatility in our stock price. 
 Our business strategy includes developing, acquiring and investing in companies and technologies that broaden our product portfolio or complement our existing business, which could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources and adversely affect our operating results. 
 As part of our long-term business strategy, we continue to evaluate the development or acquisition of strategic businesses, technologies and product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position, enhance and expand our existing set of product and service offerings or enter new markets. We may be unable to identify or successfully complete suitable acquisitions in the future and completed acquisitions may not be successful. 
 Acquisitions and technology investments may involve significant cash expenditures, the incurrence of debt, operating losses and expenses that could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These types of transactions involve numerous other risks, including but not limited to: 
 Diversion of management time and attention from existing operations, 
 Difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business or into our compliance and control programs, particularly those that include international operations, 
 Working with partners or other ownership structures with shared decision-making authority (our interests and other ownership interests may be inconsistent), 
 Difficulties in obtaining and verifying relevant information regarding a business or technology prior to the consummation of a transaction, including the identification and assessment of liabilities, claims or other circumstances, including those relating to intellectual property claims, which could result in litigation or regulatory exposure, 
 13 

Table of Contents

Assumption of liabilities that exceed our estimated amounts, 
 Verification of financial statements and other business information of an acquired business, 
 Inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms, 
 Potential loss of key employees, contractual relationships or customers of the acquired business, 
 Increased operating expenses related to the acquired businesses or technologies, 
 The failure of new technologies, products or services to gain market acceptance with acceptable profit margins, 
 Entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or in which competitors may have stronger market positions, 
 Dilution of stockholder value through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities, and 
 Inability to achieve expected synergies or the achievement of such synergies taking longer than expected to realize, including increases in sales, enhanced efficiencies or increased market share, or the benefits ultimately may be smaller than we expected. 
 Any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition, as they may not be successful and may ultimately have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and/or result in impairment charges. 
 Potential international business opportunities may expose us to additional risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 Part of our growth strategy depends on expanding internationally. Although sales outside of the United States account for a relatively small percentage of our total net sales, we have business activity in Canada, Israel and the United Kingdom. Some countries that present potential business opportunities also face political and economic instability and vulnerability to infrastructure and other disruptions. Seeking to expand our business internationally exposes us to additional risks, which include foreign exchange risks and currency fluctuations, as discussed more fully below, political and economic uncertainties, changes in local business conditions and national and international conflicts. A primary risk we face in connection with our export shipments relates to our ability to collect amounts due from customers. We also face the potential risks arising from staffing, monitoring and managing international operations, including the risk that such activities may divert our resources and management time. 
 In addition, compliance with the laws, regulations and taxes of multiple international jurisdictions increases our cost of doing business. International operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and anti-competition regulations, among others. For example, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws outside of the United States generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials and certain others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal and civil sanctions, disrupt our business and adversely affect our brands, international expansion efforts, business and operating results. 
 We make sales, incur expenses and invest cash in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of United States dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the United States dollars we receive from sales denominated in a foreign currency. Changes between a foreign exchange rate and the United States dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative effect on our financial results. We expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative distribution of our operations outside the United States increases through both organic and inorganic growth. 
 
 Risks related to our operations 
 Our reliance on vendors for certain products, some of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, could harm our business by adversely affecting product availability, reliability or cost. 
 We maintain several single-source or limited-source supplier relationships with manufacturers, including some outside of the United States. If the supply of a critical single- or limited-source product is delayed or curtailed, we may not be able to ship the related products in desired quantities or in a timely manner. Even where multiple sources of supply are available, the qualification of alternative suppliers and the establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of profits, which could harm our operating results. 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

These relationships reduce our direct control over production. Our reliance on these vendors subjects us to a greater risk of shortages, and reduced control over delivery schedules of products, as well as a greater risk of increased product costs. In instances where we stock lower levels of product inventories, a disruption in product availability could harm our financial performance and our ability to satisfy customer needs. In addition, defective products from these manufacturers could reduce product reliability and harm our reputation. 
 A disruption in our supply chain or other factors impacting the distribution of our products could adversely affect our business. 
 A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network at any of the freight companies that deliver components for our manufacturing operations in the United States or ship our fully assembled products to our customers could adversely affect our business and result in lost sales and increased expenses or harm to our reputation. Our supply chain is dependent on third-party ocean-going container ships, rail, barge, air and trucking systems and, therefore, disruption in these logistics services because of weather-related problems, such as hurricanes, strikes, bankruptcies, inflation, public health crises, such as pandemics, or other events could adversely affect our financial performance and financial condition, negatively impacting sales, profitability and cash flows. 
 The Israel-Hamas war caused a temporary shutdown in our facility in Ariel, Israel in October 2023. While we continue to operate the facility, continued disruptions and escalations of conflicts in the area increase the likelihood of supply interruptions and may continue to hinder our ability to acquire the necessary materials we need to make our products. Supply disruptions from lack of access to materials has impacted, and continues to impact, our ability to produce and deliver our products on time and at favorable pricing. 
 Seasonal demand for certain of our products and services may adversely affect our financial results. 
 Sales of some of our products, including iron gate valves and fire hydrants, are seasonal, with lower sales in our first and second fiscal quarters when the northern United States and most of Canada generally face weather conditions that restrict significant construction activity. This seasonality in demand makes it challenging to predict sales and has resulted in fluctuations in our sales and operating results. To satisfy demand during expected peak periods, we may incur costs associated with building inventory in off-peak periods, and our projections as to future needs may not be accurate. Because many of our expenses are fixed, seasonal trends can cause reductions in our profitability and profit margins and deterioration of our financial condition during periods affected by lower production or sales activity. 
 
 Transportation costs are relatively high for most of our products. 
 Transportation costs can be an important factor in a customer s purchasing decision. Many of our products are big, bulky and heavy, which tends to increase transportation costs. We also have relatively few manufacturing sites, which tends to increase transportation distances to our customers and consequently increases our transportation costs. Additionally, energy and fuel costs can fluctuate markedly, which may result in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline. High transportation costs could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors. 
 Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation. 
 
 Inflation has recently affected and has the potential to continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, including purchased parts, commodity and raw material costs and labor. In an inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and cash flows. Other inflationary pressures could affect wages, the cost and availability of components and raw materials and other inputs and our ability to meet customer demand. Inflation may further exacerbate other risk factors, including supply chain disruptions, risks related to international operations and the recruitment and retention of qualified employees . 
 
 Our high fixed costs may make it more difficult for us to respond to economic cycles. 
 A significant portion of our cost structure is fixed, including manufacturing overhead, capital equipment and research and development costs. In a prolonged economic downturn, these fixed costs may cause our gross margins to erode and our earnings to decline.

We may experience difficulties implementing upgrades to our software systems. 
 We engage in implementations and upgrades to our software systems, including to our Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system. The ERP is designed to accurately maintain the Company s books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to the Company s management team. Any software implementation or upgrade requires significant investment of human and financial resources, and we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of our software systems, including our ERP, could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. While we invest significant resources in planning and project management, significant issues may arise. 
 
 Normal operations at our key manufacturing facilities may be interrupted. 
 Some of our key products, including fire hydrants, iron gate valves, service brass products, specialty valves and repair products are manufactured at a single facility or a few facilities, which depend on critical pieces of heavy equipment that cannot be moved economically to other locations or sourced quickly. We are therefore limited in our ability to shift production among locations. The operations at our manufacturing facilities may be interrupted or impaired by various operating risks, including, but not limited to: 
 Catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, explosions, natural disasters, new and ongoing public health crises, severe weather or other similar occurrences, 
 Terrorist attacks, governmental instability, national emergencies, wars, mass shootings or other acts of violence, 
 Interruptions in the delivery of raw materials or purchased parts, shortages of equipment or spare parts or other manufacturing inputs, 
 Adverse government regulations, including trade protection measures and import or export duties or licensing requirements, 
 Equipment or information systems breakdowns or failures, 
 Maintenance outages to conduct maintenance activities that cannot be performed safely during operations, 
 Prolonged power failures or reductions, 
 Violations of our permit requirements or revocation of permits, 
 Release of pollutants and hazardous substances to air, soil, surface water or ground water, 
 Labor disputes, and 
 Cyberattacks and events. 
 The occurrence of any of these events may impair our production capabilities and adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows. 
 Any inability to protect our intellectual property or our failure to effectively defend against intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our competitive position. 
 Our business depends on our technology and expertise, which were largely developed internally and are not subject to statutory protection. We rely on a combination of patent protection, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets protection, employee and third-party confidentiality agreements as well as technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. The methods we employ to protect our intellectual property rights may not adequately deter infringement, misappropriation or independent development of our technology, and they may not prevent an unauthorized party from obtaining or using information or intellectual property that we regard as proprietary or keep others from using brand names similar to our own. The disclosure, misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position. In addition, our actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and other resources. We may also be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from time to time, which may result in additional expense and the diversion of resources to respond to these claims. Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired the product is further subjected to competition. Products under patent protection potentially generate significantly higher sales and earnings than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents, our competitive position could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

If we do not successfully maintain our information and technology networks, including the security of those networks, our operations could be disrupted and unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in sales could result. 
 We rely on various information technology systems, some of which are controlled by outside service providers, to manage key aspects of our operations. The proper functioning of our information technology systems is important to the successful operation of our business. If critical information technology systems fail, or are otherwise unavailable, our ability to manufacture products, process orders, track credit risk, identify business opportunities, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses and otherwise manage our business would be adversely affected. 
 We depend on the Internet and our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and among our personnel, suppliers and customers. Cyber and other data security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Likewise, if we or our service providers are unable to prevent future cybersecurity incidents, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial, reputational or other harm. We continue to incur costs in connection with efforts to investigate potential threats, assess relevant impacts, enhance our data security and protect against unauthorized access to, or manipulation of, our systems and data. Despite incurring these costs, we may not be able to prevent future cyber incidents. Further, customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, confidentiality and intellectual property, which may also increase our overall compliance burden and related costs. 
 We may fail to effectively manage confidential data, which could harm our reputation, result in substantial additional costs and subject us to litigation. 
 As we grow our technology-enabled products, services and solutions, we continue to accumulate increasing volumes of customer data. In addition, we store personal information in connection with our human resources operations. Our efforts to protect this information may be unsuccessful as a result of employee errors or malfeasance, technical malfunctions, the actions of third parties such as a cyberattack or other factors. As previously reported, we have in the past experienced cybersecurity incidents. If our cyber defenses and other countermeasures are unable to protect personal data, it could be accessed or disclosed improperly, which could expose us to liability, harm our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services. The regulatory environment related to cyber and information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous and evolving, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. 
 Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced sales, increased costs, liability claims, unauthorized access to customer data or harm to our reputation. 
 Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving and can take a variety of forms, increasing the difficulty of preventing, detecting and successfully defending against them. Individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our information technology systems. These actors use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, radio communication protocols or other infrastructure to attack our products and services. Additionally, these actors may reverse-engineer trade secrets or other confidential intellectual property, or gain access to our networks and data centers, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or to take other actions to gain access to our data or our users or customers data, or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks, or deny or postpone access to critical water infrastructure telemetry through vulnerabilities in our cloud services and infrastructure, or logging, sensing and telemetry products. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. 
 Despite the implementation of a variety of security controls and measures, as well as those of our third-party administrators and vendors, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent or detect another cybersecurity incident or other vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cybersecurity events have had, and in the future may have, cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems. Such threats may also impact the networks and systems of our business associates and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network or data security have in the past and may in the future disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies. Such breaches may also impair our ability to protect the privacy of customer data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, or otherwise adversely affect our business.

Misuse of our technology-enabled products, services and solutions could lead to reduced sales, increased costs, liability claims or harm to our reputation. 
 
 As we continue to design and develop products, services and solutions that leverage our hosted or cloud-based resources, the internet-of-things and other wireless/remote technologies, and include networks of distributed and interconnected devices that contain sensors, data transfers and other computing capabilities, our customers data and systems may be subjected to harmful or illegal content or attacks, including potential cybersecurity threats. Additionally, we may not have adequately anticipated or precluded such cybersecurity threats through our product design or development. These products, services and solutions inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects which may not have been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We may also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix, and the timing of these fixes, which could result in compromised security. These vulnerabilities and security defects could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of information/data; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data protection, data security, network security and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our products, services and solutions; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. 
 
 We are subject to a variety of claims, investigations and litigation that could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our reputation. 
 In the normal course of business, we are subject to claims and lawsuits, including from time to time, claims for damages related to product liability and warranties, investigations by governmental agencies, litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights and litigation related to employee matters and commercial disputes. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to investigations, claims, litigation and other proceedings outside the ordinary course of business. Defending these lawsuits and becoming involved in these investigations may divert management s attention, and may cause us to incur significant expenses, even if there is no evidence that our systems or practices were the cause of the claim. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards, penalties or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. See Item 1. BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters, Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies and Note 15. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We are subject to stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may adversely affect us. 
 We are subject to stringent laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety and incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with any environmental, health or safety requirement could result in the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production, changes to equipment or processes or a cessation of operations at our facilities, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Because these laws are complex, subject to change and may be applied retroactively, we cannot predict with certainty the extent of our future liabilities with respect to environmental, health and safety matters and whether they will be material. 
 In addition, certain statutes, such as CERCLA, may impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on entities that generated waste, arranged for disposal of waste, transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites. All such potentially responsible parties PRP ), or any one of them, including us, may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault, the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site. As a result, we may be required to conduct investigations and perform remedial activities at current and former operating and manufacturing sites where we have been deemed, or in the future could be named, a PRP with respect to such environmental liabilities, any of which could require us to incur material costs. The final remediation costs of these environmental sites may exceed estimated costs, and additional sites in the future may require material remediation expenses. If actual expenditures exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1. BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters, - Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies and Note 15. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Climate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 The impacts of climate change are highly unpredictable, and there is growing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures as a result of increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. These impacts present potential challenges to water related products, such as degradation of water quality and changes in water conservation or efficiency requirements. Certain events may disrupt the operations of our customers, creating customer shutdowns that prevent or defer sales of our products or services, while other events may drive increased demand for our products or services, which may create volatility in our business and results of operations. 
 
 Growing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. Many of our manufacturing plants use significant amounts of electricity generated by burning fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses as a result of increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The impacts of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Climate change and efforts to limit climate change may impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint or in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives, the results could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 We rely on successors to Tyco to indemnify us for certain liabilities and they may become financially unable or fail to comply with the terms of the indemnity. 
 Under the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to the August 1999 sale by Tyco of businesses which make up certain of the companies within Mueller Water Products, Inc., we are indemnified by certain Tyco entities Tyco Indemnitors for all liabilities arising in connection with the operation of these businesses prior to their sale by Tyco, including with respect to products manufactured or sold prior to the closing of that transaction, as well as certain environmental liabilities. These indemnities survive indefinitely and are not subject to any dollar limits. In the past, Tyco Indemnitors have made substantial payments and assumed defense of claims in connection with these indemnification obligations. Tyco s indemnity does not cover liabilities to the extent caused by us or the operation of our businesses after August 1999, nor does it cover liabilities arising with respect to businesses or sites acquired after August 1999. Since 2007, Tyco has engaged in multiple corporate restructurings, split-offs and divestitures. The result of these transactions is that the assets of, and control over, Tyco Indemnitors has changed. Should any Tyco Indemnitor become financially unable or fail to comply with the terms of the indemnity, we may be responsible for such obligations or liabilities. 
 Risks related to our human capital 
 We depend on qualified personnel and if we are unable to retain or hire executive officers, key employees and skilled personnel, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business may be adversely affected. 
 From time to time, there are changes to our executive leadership team, including as a result of the hiring, departure or realignment of key personnel. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk, and any failure to find a necessary, suitable replacement on a timely basis to ensure a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. Our ability to expand or maintain our business depends on our ability to hire, train and retain employees, including executive officers, with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers. The increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets, as well as employees with specialized technical and trade experience. Changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. If we fail to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience excessive turnover, we may experience declining sales, manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies, increased recruiting, training and relocation costs and other difficulties, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel, which could negatively impact our business.

If we are unable to negotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we experience strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or higher than normal absenteeism, our business could suffer. 
 Many of our employees at our manufacturing locations are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on generally satisfactory terms, negotiations may be challenging as we must have a competitive cost structure in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could impact our financial position and results of operations. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our plants could impair our ability to supply products to our distributors and customers, which could reduce our sales, increase our expenses and expose us to customer claims. 
 
 Furthermore, our ability to meet product delivery commitments and labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including, but not limited to: 
 
 Market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, 
 Unemployment levels, 
 Health and other insurance costs, 
 The impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits, 
 Changing demographics, 
 Availability of skilled labor, and 
 Our reputation within the labor market. 
 
 We also compete with many other industries and businesses for most of our hourly production employees. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees. Further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs. 
 
 Our expenditures for pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted. 
 We provide pension benefits to certain current and former employees. To determine our future payment obligations under the plan, certain rates of return on the plan s assets, growth rates of certain costs and participant longevity have been estimated. The proportion of fixed income and equity securities held by the plan is heavily weighted to fixed income and varies based on funding status in accordance with the plan s governing investment policy. Assumed discount rates, expected return on plan assets and participant longevity have significant effects on the amounts reported for our pension obligations and pension expenses. 
 The funded status of our pension plans may also be influenced by regulatory requirements, which can change unexpectedly and impose higher costs if funding levels are below certain thresholds. We may increase contributions to our pension plans to avoid or reduce these higher costs. 
 Significant adverse changes in credit and capital markets or changes in investments could result in discount rates or actual rates of return on plan assets being materially lower than projected and require us to increase pension contributions in future years to meet funding level requirements. Increasing life spans for plan participants may increase the estimated benefit payments and increase the amounts reported for pension obligations, pension contributions and pension expenses. If increased funding requirements are particularly significant and sustained, our overall liquidity could be materially reduced, which could cause us to reduce investments and capital expenditures, or restructure or refinance our debt, among other things.

The Israel-Hamas war may continue to adversely affect our ability to staff and operate our Ariel, Israel facility. 
 We employed Palestinians in our Ariel, Israel facility prior to August 2023. As a result of the Israel-Hamas war, upon reopening the facility after a temporary shutdown, Palestinian employees have not rejoined our workforce due to, among other things, travel and movement restrictions imposed on Palestinian workers in connection with the war. Furthermore, this facility has been adversely impacted by limited labor availability in the region, which has resulted in delays in our ability to produce and deliver products and meet customer delivery times. If we are unable to recruit and train new staff resources with sufficient technical skills in a manner that allows us to increase production levels and meet customer delivery times, we may continue to experience delays in our ability to produce and deliver certain of our products to customers, and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. 
 
 Risks related to our international operations 
 Any failure to satisfy international trade laws and regulations or to otherwise comply with changes or other trade developments may adversely affect us. 
 Our operations require importing and exporting goods and technology among countries on a regular basis. Thus, the sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Trade laws and regulations are complex, differ by country and are enforced by a variety of government agencies. Because we are subject to extensive trade laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a manner that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities, and our policies and procedures may not always protect us from actions that would violate international trade laws and regulations. For example, certain federal legislation requires the use of American iron and steel products in certain water projects receiving certain federal appropriations. In addition, we have incurred costs to comply with these requirements, including those associated with enhancing our assembly operations and sourcing practices. As a result of the varying legal and regulatory requirements to which our cross-border activities are subject, we have not always been, and may not always be, in compliance with the trade laws and regulations in all respects. Improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions, including denial of import or export privileges, and could harm our reputation and our business prospects. See Note 15. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 If significant tariffs or other restrictions continue to be placed on foreign imports by the United States and related countermeasures are taken by impacted foreign countries, our sales and results of operations may be harmed. 
 If significant tariffs or other restrictions continue to be placed on foreign imports by the United States and related countermeasures are taken by impacted foreign countries, our sales and results of operations may be harmed. For example, ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories over recent years. Further, President-elect Trump has proposed significantly increased tariffs on foreign imports into the United States, particularly from China. The materials subject to these tariffs can be expected to impact our raw material costs as well. If further tariffs are imposed on a broader range of imports, or if further retaliatory trade measures are taken by China or other countries in response to additional tariffs, we may be required to raise our prices or incur additional expenses, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance, sales and earnings. 
 The prices of our purchased components and raw materials can be volatile. 
 Our operations require substantial amounts of purchased components and raw materials, such as scrap steel, sand, resin, brass ingot and steel pipe. The cost and availability of these materials are subject to economic forces largely beyond our control, including North American and international demand, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, freight costs, tariffs, commodity speculation and other external factors, including public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other supply chain challenges. Inflation in material costs has occurred in 2023 and 2024 and we expect it to continue into fiscal 2025. 
 
 We may not be able to pass on all, or any, of increased costs for purchased components and raw materials to our customers or offset fully the effects of these higher costs through productivity improvements. In particular, when purchased component or raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than normal levels, we may not be able to pass cost increases through to our customers on a timely basis, if at all, which would reduce our profitability and cash flows. In addition, if purchased components or raw materials are not available or not available on commercially reasonable terms, our sales, profitability and cash flows would be reduced. Our competitors may secure more reliable sources of purchased components and raw materials or they may obtain these supplies on more favorable terms than we do, which could give them a cost advantage.

Our business, operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted by geopolitical events, including wars, terrorism, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. 
 
 Geopolitical events, international disputes, wars, terrorism, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce as well as the global economy and could have a materially adverse effect on us and our customers, suppliers, logistics providers, distributors and other channel partners. The threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto, or any other current or future acts of terrorism, wars, including the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars, and other events, including economic sanctions and trade restrictions, have disrupted the world s economies and may cause further disruptions that could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Our Krausz business includes a manufacturing facility in Ariel, Israel. Supply chain disruptions, facility access and our inability to appropriately staff the Ariel facility has limited, and will likely continue to limit, our ability to produce Krausz products. These impacts are requiring us to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, outsourcing portions of the manufacturing process and modifying the manner in which we staff our facilities. Changing our operations in response to wartime impacts can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. If the Israel-Hamas war continues, additional restrictions and other governmental actions could increase the severity of the impact on our operations in Israel and could materially adversely affect our business. A severe disruption to our business may result in significant lost sales and may require substantial recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. 
 
 Additionally, to the extent the Israel-Hamas war causes loss of infrastructure and utilities services, such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications, plant closures and employee concerns in our Krausz business, we could experience increased costs and other negative financial impacts. If such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 Other risks related to our business 
 Our business, operations and markets, and those of our suppliers, business partners and customers, may be adversely affected by current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases or other health crises. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on global economies created a number of macroeconomic challenges that impacted our business, including volatility and uncertainty in business planning, disruptions in global supply chains, material, freight and labor inflation, shortages of and delays in obtaining certain materials and component parts and labor shortages. 
 Future outbreaks of infectious diseases, including further developments in the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in widespread or localized health crises that adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and markets of the countries and localities in which we operate, sell and purchase goods and services. Any outbreak of infectious disease poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, transportation providers and other business partners may be prevented or impaired from conducting ordinary business activities for an indefinite period of time, including self-imposed facility shutdowns to protect the health and well-being of our employees or government-mandated shutdowns. In addition, our suppliers, business partners and customers may also experience similar negative impacts. Global supply chains may be disrupted, causing shortages, which could impact our ability to manufacture or supply our products. This disruption of our employees, distributors, suppliers and customers may impact our sales and future operating results. 

Item 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 
 Our Board of Directors maintains oversight responsibility for how we manage risk, and it charges management with assessing and mitigating that risk through the development, implementation and maintenance of our risk management processes including our cybersecurity program. Our internal audit department, which reports to the Audit Committee, administers our enterprise risk assessment and, in coordination with our legal and compliance functions, is responsible for ongoing enterprise risk management assessments. Our internal audit department also regularly reports to the Board of Directors and its committees on risk-related issues. 
 
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our cybersecurity and data privacy programs and practices and consults with management regarding cybersecurity initiatives. This committee is also responsible for reviewing cyber and data security matters, including cybersecurity threats to us and our risk mitigation initiatives. At least twice a year, the Audit Committee receives updates on our cybersecurity and data privacy programs and practices from our Senior Vice President of

Information Technology and our Senior Director of Information Security. The topics reported by the Senior Vice President of Information Technology and our Senior Director of Information Security include updates on cybersecurity threats to us, the status of projects to strengthen our information security systems, assessments of the cybersecurity program, and the emerging threat landscape, as well as the results of any third-party assessments conducted. Our Senior Vice President of Information Technology holds an undergraduate degree in Technology Management (Manufacturing Systems), and has served in various roles in information technology, information security and engineering for over 14 years and within Mueller for four years. Our Senior Director of Information Security holds an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering and has served in various roles in information technology and information security within Mueller for over 20 years. 
 
 We have two cybersecurity teams, each dedicated to a specific area. Our Information Technology Cybersecurity team focuses on corporate programs, and our Products Cybersecurity team focuses on customer-facing programs. These teams work collaboratively to implement programs designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats and to promptly respond to any cybersecurity incidents in accordance with our incident response and recovery plans. To facilitate the success of our cybersecurity risk management program, these teams are charged with addressing cybersecurity threats and responding to cybersecurity incidents. Through ongoing communications with these teams, the Senior Vice President of Information Technology, the Senior Director of Information Security and the General Counsel monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents in real time and report such threats and incidents to the Audit Committee when appropriate. Similarly, the Audit Committee reports cybersecurity threats and incidents to the full Board of Directors as appropriate. 
 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 
 Risk Assessment 
 
 Our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices are integrated into our enterprise risk management processes and are based on a recognized framework established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST ). In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a comprehensive, cross-functional approach that is focused on preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information that we collect and store by identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur. We have established and maintain comprehensive incident response and recovery plans that detail our planned responses to cybersecurity incidents. These plans are tested and evaluated on a regular basis. We periodically assess and test the policies, standards, processes and practices that are designed to address cybersecurity threats and incidents. These efforts include a wide range of activities, including audits, assessments, tabletop exercises, threat modeling vulnerability testing and other exercises focused on evaluating the effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures and planning. 
 
 Independent Assessments 
 
 We regularly engage third parties to perform assessments of our cybersecurity programs, including information security maturity assessments, audits and independent reviews of our information security control environment and operating effectiveness. The results of such assessments, audits and reviews are reported to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, and we adjust our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices as necessary based on the information provided by these assessments, audits and reviews. 
 
 Technical Safeguards 
 
 We deploy technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, including 24/7 detect and response services, network activity monitoring, phishing prevention, penetration testing and periodic IT security maturity assessments. As part of these efforts, we have engaged third-party cybersecurity providers to help deploy and monitor these safeguards and to assist in the event of a security incident or similar issue by conducting forensics reviews and assisting more broadly with the mitigation and remediation of any such event. 
 
 Third-Party Risks 
 
 We maintain a comprehensive, risk-based approach to identifying and overseeing cybersecurity risks presented by third parties, including vendors, service providers and other external users of our systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting those third-party systems.

Education and Awareness 
 
 All employees are required to complete information security awareness training upon joining the Company. Based on individual phishing test performance and job requirements, additional training may be offered or required on an as-needed basis. 
 
 Effects and Impacts of Cybersecurity Risks 
 
 As announced on October 28, 2023, we identified a cybersecurity incident impacting certain internal operations and information technology systems which adversely affected our ability to ship orders in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. All of our facilities were operational by mid-December 2023 and were returned to normalized operations. We incurred 1.5 million of expenses related to the cybersecurity incident in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2024.

Overview 
 Business 
 We operate our business through two segments, Water Flow Solutions and Water Management Solutions. The Water Flow Solutions product portfolio includes iron gate valves, specialty valves and service brass products. The Water Management Solutions product and service portfolio includes fire hydrants, repair and installation, natural gas, metering, leak detection, as well as pressure management and control products and solutions. 
 In August 2023, Marietta Edmunds Zakas was appointed to Chief Executive Officer and to the Board of Directors. Ms. Zakas formerly served as our Chief Financial Officer. In May 2024, Paul McAndrew, Chief Operating Officer, was promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer. In September 2024, we announced that Steven S. Heinrichs, the Company s Chief Financial Officer CFO and Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, will be transitioning from his position effective on or about December 31, 2024. Mr. Heinrichs will continue to serve as CFO and Chief Legal and Compliance Officer until a new CFO has been named. 
 We estimate approximately 60 to 65 of the Company s 2024 net sales were associated with the repair and replacement of municipal water infrastructure, approximately 25 to 30 were related to residential construction activity and approximately 10 were related to natural gas utilities and industrial applications. 
 After experiencing challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply disruptions in years 2020 through 2023, the seasonality of our business returned to more normalized levels in 2024, supported by municipal spending on repair and replacement projects and new residential construction activity. According to the United States Department of Labor, the trailing twelve-month average consumer price index for water and sewerage rates at September 30, 2024 increased 5.2 . Total housing starts in fiscal 2024 decreased 1.6 as compared with fiscal 2023, according to the United States Census Bureau, despite a 13 increase in single family housing starts as compared with fiscal 2023. 
 Recent Developments 
 In October 2023, the Israel-Hamas war caused a temporary shutdown in our facility in Ariel, Israel. While we reopened the facility in November 2023, the war has caused supply chain challenges that continue to hinder our ability to most efficiently manufacture our products produced in Israel. These supply chain disruptions have adversely impacted, and continue to adversely impact, our ability to optimally produce and deliver our products from our facility in Ariel, Israel. Additionally, production at this facility has been adversely impacted by limited labor availability in the region. We have made investments in recruiting and training new team members, expanding our suppliers and expediting product shipments to increase production levels and to meet customer delivery times. 
 The cybersecurity incident in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 consisted of unauthorized access and deployment of ransomware by a third party to a portion of our internal information system infrastructure. The incident caused temporary disruptions and limitations of access to portions of our business applications supporting certain aspects of our operations including shipping, receiving and payment functions. Operational delays as well as investigation and remediation costs in connection with the incident adversely impacted our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024; however, there was no material impact to our consolidated net sales for the full fiscal 2024. We have restored the impacted applications and systems. As reported on November 29, 2023, we identified a separate cybersecurity incident, which primarily related to a system that was at the end of its useful life and was already in the process of being replaced in the ordinary course of business. We completed the replacement of this system during the second quarter of fiscal 2024.

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

In fiscal 2024, we incurred approximately 1.5 million of expenses related to the cybersecurity incidents. We continue to address the impacts of the cybersecurity incidents, including making enhancements to our cybersecurity processes and analyzing the data accessed, exfiltrated or otherwise impacted in connection with the cybersecurity incidents. 
 Outlook 
 For fiscal year 2025, we anticipate that consolidated net sales will increase between 1.9 and 3.4 as compared with fiscal 2024. The external operating environment remains dynamic as we face uncertainties and challenges emanating from the interest rate environment, the Israel-Hamas war and unrest in the Middle East, as well as labor inflation and availability. We expect these challenges to continue during fiscal 2025. After our short-cycle channel and customer inventory levels largely normalized during the first quarter of 2024, our orders and shipments reflected a more typical operating environment compared with the high backlog environment we experienced during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. For fiscal 2025, we assume that we will continue to experience a more normalized operating environment leading to normalized seasonality for consolidated net sales. Therefore, we anticipate quarterly consolidated net sales as a percentage of fiscal year 2025 consolidated net sales to be the highest in the third quarter and lowest in the first quarter, with a sequential increase in consolidated net sales in the second quarter as the construction season ramps up for the Spring. We anticipate resilient demand in the municipal repair and replacement end market driven by the aging water infrastructure albeit moderated by budgetary and operational pressures on municipalities. Additionally, we anticipate that new residential construction activity and new lot and land development will be relatively constrained by the interest rate environment, depending on the geography. For fiscal 2025, we anticipate that inflation will continue to modestly impact manufacturing costs, primarily due to wage inflation, as well as raw materials and purchased parts. We will continue to monitor the market and economic conditions impacting our business and take appropriate actions to address inflationary and other cost pressures by implementing price increases, cost containment measures and supplier management measures, among other actions.

Gross profit for 2024 was 459.0 million as compared with 379.5 million in the prior year, an increase of 79.5 million or 20.9 , primarily a result of favorable manufacturing performance related to labor, overhead and logistics efficiencies and favorable price/cost. This increase was partially offset by negative impacts from the Israel-Hamas war of approximately 4 . Gross margin increased to 34.9 in 2024 as compared with 29.7 in the prior year. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A for 2024 were 245.2 million as compared with 241.9 million in the prior year, an increase of 3.3 million or 1.4 , primarily due to higher employee incentives, higher costs associated with approximately 3 inflation and the impact of foreign currency fluctuation, partially offset by a decrease in salary and benefit expense associated with our restructuring activities, third-party fees and engineering materials expense. As a percentage of net sales, SG A decreased 30 basis points to 18.7 of net sales from 19.0 in the prior year. 
 Strategic reorganization and other charges for 2024 of 15.8 million primarily consisted of expenses associated with the leadership transition, certain transaction-related expenses, 1.8 million related to non-cash asset impairment, expenses associated with the cybersecurity incidents and severance. Strategic reorganization and other charges for 2023 of 10.2 million primarily consisted of expenses associated with the leadership transition, severance and certain transaction-related expenses.

 Income tax expense of 47.5 million in 2024 resulted in an effective income tax rate of 29.1 , which was higher than the 21.6 rate in the prior year primarily as a result of certain non-deductible items, including non-cash goodwill impairment, an increase in the state income tax rate and lesser foreign tax rate benefits. 
 Segment Analysis 
 Water Flow Solutions 
 Net sales for 2024 were 755.5 million as compared with 634.4 million in the prior year, an increase of 121.1 million or 19.1 , primarily as a result of higher volumes in iron gate valves and service brass products as well as higher pricing across most of Water Flow Solutions product lines. 
 Gross profit for 2024 was 271.9 million as compared with 164.9 million in the prior year, an increase of 107.0 million or 64.9 , primarily as a result of favorable manufacturing performance driven by labor, overhead and logistic efficiencies, higher volumes and favorable price/cost, partially offset by higher custom duties expense.

 Index to Financial Statements 

Water Management Solutions 
 Net sales for 2024 were 559.2 million as compared with 641.3 million in the prior year, a decrease of 82.1 million or 12.8 , primarily as a result of lower volumes across most product lines, including the impact of the Israel-Hamas war, partially offset by higher pricing across most of Water Management Solutions product lines. 
 Gross profit for 2024 was 187.1 million as compared with 214.6 million in the prior year, a decrease of 27.5 million or 12.8 , primarily as a result of lower volumes including the impact of the Israel-Hamas war, partially offset by favorable price/cost and favorable manufacturing performance. Gross margin was 33.5 in both 2024 and 2023. 
 SG A for 2024 was 95.0 million as compared with 106.9 million in the prior year, a decrease of 11.9 million or 11.1 primarily due to lower salary and benefit expense associated with our restructuring activities and lower third-party fees, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuation, higher employee incentives and approximately 3 inflation. SG A as a percentage of net sales was 17.0 for 2024 and 16.7 in the prior year. 
 During the year ended September 30, 2024, Water Management Solution incurred a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 16.3 million. No goodwill impairment charge was recorded in 2023. 
 Corporate 
 SG A for 2024 was 57.7 million as compared with 49.7 million in the prior year, an increase of 8.0 million or 16.1 primarily as a result of higher employee incentives, higher third-party fees, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuation and approximately 3 inflation, partially offset by lower salary and benefit expense associated with our restructuring activities. 

Financial Condition 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 309.9 million at September 30, 2024 and 160.3 million at September 30, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents increased during 2024 primarily as a result of 238.8 million in cash provided by operating activities, 4.0 million in effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash, partially offset by capital expenditures of 47.4 million, dividend payments of 39.9 million, and 10.0 million in common stock repurchases. 
 Receivables, net were 208.9 million at September 30, 2024 and 217.1 million at September 30, 2023. This decrease was a result of lower days sales outstanding. 
 Inventories, net were 301.7 million at September 30, 2024 and 297.9 million at September 30, 2023. Inventories increased during 2024 as a result of higher finished goods and approximately 1 inflation, partially offset by lower raw materials. 
 Property, plant and equipment, net was 318.8 million at September 30, 2024 and 311.7 million at September 30, 2023. Property, plant and equipment increased as a result of 47.4 million in capital expenditures primarily associated with our new brass foundry in Decatur, Illinois, partially offset by depreciation expense of 39.1 million. Depreciation expense increased from 34.4 million in 2023 as a result of accelerated depreciation of certain assets. 
 Intangible assets were 309.7 million at September 30, 2024 and 334.0 million at September 30, 2023. Finite-lived intangible assets, net totaling 37.2 million at September 30, 2024, are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense was 27.1 million in 2024 and 28.1 million in 2023. We expect amortization expense for these assets to be approximately 7 million for 2025, approximately 6 million in fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, approximately 5 million in fiscal 2028, and approximately 4 million in fiscal 2029. The reduction in amortization expense is a result of certain customer relationship intangibles becoming fully amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, 272.5 million at September 30, 2024, are not amortized but are tested for potential impairment at least annually. 
 Accounts payable and other current liabilities were 257.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 218.1 million at September 30, 2023. Accounts payable increased during 2024 primarily as a result of timing and inflation. Other current liabilities increased during 2024 primarily as a result of higher personnel-related accruals, customer rebates, and product liabilities, partially offset by lower income taxes payable and accrued restructuring costs. 
 Total outstanding debt was 449.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and 447.4 million as of September 30, 2023. Total debt increased due to the addition of new financing leases and the amortization of deferred financing costs.

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

Deferred income taxes were net liabilities of 55.4 million at September 30, 2024 and 73.8 million at September 30, 2023, primarily related to intangible assets. The 18.4 million decrease in the net liability was primarily a result of an increase in deferred tax assets related to Internal Revenue Code Section 174 pertaining to the amortization of research and development expenditures and an increase in other accrued expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 309.9 million at September 30, 2024 and approximately 162.6 million of additional borrowing capacity under our asset-based lending arrangement (the ABL based on September 30, 2024 data. Undistributed earnings from our subsidiaries in Israel, Canada and China are considered to be permanently invested outside of the United States. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents included 80.7 million, 10.3 million, and 10.0 million in Israel, Canada, and China, respectively. 
 We declared a quarterly dividend of 0.067 per common share on October 22, 2024, payable on or about November 20, 2024 to holders of record as of November 8, 2024, which we expect to result in an estimated 10.5 million cash outlay. 
 We repurchased 10.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 and had 80.0 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2024. 
 The ABL and 4.0 Senior Notes contain customary representations and warranties, covenants and provisions governing an event of default. The covenants restrict our ability to engage in certain activities including, but not limited to, the payment of dividends and the redemption of our common stock. 
 Collections from customers were higher during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the prior year period primarily as a result of higher sales during the comparative periods. Inventories increased during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of inflation and timing of shipments. Other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities increased as a result of higher employee-related accruals, product liabilities, and customer rebates, partially offset by lower income taxes payable and accrued restructuring costs. 
 
 Capital expenditures remained fairly constant at 47.4 million for 2024 compared with 47.6 million for 2023. We estimate 2025 capital expenditures will be between 45.0 million and 50.0 million. 
 
 Income tax payments were higher during 2024 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of higher income before income taxes as well as the timing of certain federal and state extension payments. We expect the effective tax rate in 2025 to be between 25 and 27 . 
 Our stock repurchase program allows us to repurchase up to 250.0 million of our common stock, of which we had remaining authorization of 80.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The program does not commit us to any particular timing or quantity of purchases, and we may suspend or discontinue the program at any time. We repurchased 636,789 and 714,830 shares of our common stock in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We use letters of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to ensure the performance of contractual obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had 12.2 million of letters of credit and 13.8 million of surety bonds outstanding. 
 We anticipate our existing cash, cash equivalents and borrowing capacity combined with our expected operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs, income tax payments, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due through the twelve months from the date of this filing. However, our ability to make these payments will depend largely on our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. 
 ABL Agreement 
 Our ABL is provided by a syndicate of banking institutions and consists of a revolving credit facility of 175.0 million in borrowing capacity that matures the earlier of (a) March 16, 2029, which is ninety-one days prior to the stated maturity date of our 4.0 Senior Notes if the Notes are still outstanding on that date or (b) March 28, 2029. The ABL includes the ability to borrow up to 25.0 million of swing line loans and up to 60.0 million of letters of credit. The ABL permits us to increase the size of the credit facility by an additional 150.0 million in certain circumstances subject to adequate borrowing base availability.

In December 2023, we obtained a waiver under our ABL ABL Waiver to provide for additional time associated with certain reporting requirements that were delayed as a result of the cybersecurity incident announced on October 28, 2023. Under the ABL Waiver, the maximum aggregate amount of borrowings and other credit extensions under the ABL was temporarily limited to 50.0 million until all of the required reports were delivered. During our first fiscal quarter of 2024, we delivered the required reports, and on February 6, 2024, the ABL Waiver was terminated. Accordingly, we are no longer subject to the 50.0 million temporary limit on credit extensions. 
 On March 28, 2024, we amended our ABL to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date from July 29, 2025 to the earlier of (a) March 28, 2029 and (b) 91 days prior to the stated maturity date of the Company s 4.0 Senior Notes due June 15, 2029 (as may be extended from time to time in accordance with the Indenture governing the notes) if the 4.0 Senior Notes are then outstanding, (ii) decrease the grid-based interest rate margins by approximately 50 basis points to 150 basis points for Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR loans and 50 basis points for base rate loans when average availability is greater than 50 of the aggregate revolving commitments, and to 175 basis points for SOFR loans and 75 basis points for base rate loans, when average availability is less than or equal to 50 of the aggregate revolving credit commitments and (iii) replace the previously fixed 37.5 basis point unused commitment fee with a grid-based, quarterly unused commitment fee equal to (a) 37.5 basis points if average daily outstanding credit extensions for such quarter under the ABL Total Outstandings are less than or equal to 50 of the aggregate revolving credit commitments or (b) 25.0 basis points if Total Outstandings for such quarter are greater than or equal to 50 of the aggregate revolving credit commitments. We incurred approximately 0.9 million in debt issuance costs in connection with the ABL amendment which were capitalized and are amortized over the term of the ABL. 
 Borrowings under the ABL bear interest at a floating rate equal to SOFR plus an adjustment of 10 basis points and an applicable margin range of 150 to 175 basis points, or a base rate, as defined in the ABL, plus an applicable margin of 50 to 75 basis points. At September 30, 2024, the applicable margin was 150 basis points for SOFR-based loans and 50 basis points for base rate loans. 
 The ABL is subject to mandatory prepayments if total outstanding borrowings under the ABL are greater than the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility or if we dispose of overdue accounts receivable in certain circumstances. The borrowing base under the ABL is equal to the sum of (a) 85 of the value of eligible accounts receivable and (b) the lesser of (i) 70 of the value of eligible inventory or (ii) 85 of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, less certain reserves. Prepayments can be made at any time without penalty. The ABL allows for certain restricted payments such as cash dividends on our common stock up to certain thresholds. 
 Substantially all of our United States subsidiaries are borrowers under the ABL and are jointly and severally liable for any outstanding borrowings. Our obligations under the ABL are secured by a first-priority perfected lien on all of our United States inventory, accounts receivable, certain cash balances and other supporting assets. 
 The ABL includes a commitment fee for any unused borrowing capacity of 37.5 basis points per annum when the unused capacity is above 50 of the credit commitments, with a step down to 25.0 basis points per annum when unused capacity is less than or equal to 50 of the credit commitments. At September 30, 2024, the commitment fee was 37.5 basis points. 
 Borrowings are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants unless excess availability is less than the greater of 17.5 million and 10 of the Loan Cap as defined in the ABL. Excess availability based on September 30, 2024 data was 162.6 million, as reduced by 12.2 million of outstanding letters of credit and 0.2 million of accrued fees and expenses. 
 4.0 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 On May 28, 2021, we privately issued 450.0 million of 4.0 Senior Unsecured Notes 4.0 Senior Notes ), which mature on June 15, 2029 and bear interest at 4.0 , paid semi-annually in June and December. We capitalized 5.5 million of financing costs, which are being amortized over the term of the 4.0 Senior Notes using the effective interest method. Proceeds from the 4.0 Senior Notes, along with cash on hand were used to redeem previously existing notes. Substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the 4.0 Senior Notes, which are subordinate to borrowings under our ABL. Based on quoted market prices the outstanding 4.0 Senior Notes had a fair value of 430.2 million at September 30, 2024. 
 An indenture governing the 4.0 Senior Notes Indenture contains customary covenants and events of default, including covenants that limit our ability to incur certain debt and liens. There are no financial maintenance covenants associated with the Indenture. We believe we were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 We may redeem some or all of the 4.0 Senior Notes at any time after June 15, 2024, at specified redemption prices. Upon a Change of Control, as defined in the Indenture, we would be required to offer to purchase the 4.0 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101 of the outstanding principal amount if there is a Ratings Decline (as defined in the Indenture).

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 We enter into a variety of contractual obligations as part of our normal operations in addition to capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2024, we have (i) debt obligations related to our 450.0 million 4.0 Senior Notes which mature in 2029 and include cash interest payments of 18.0 million in 2025 annually through 2029; (ii) cumulative cash obligations of 32.9 million for operating leases through 2034 and 3.1 million for finance leases through 2029; and (iii) purchase obligations for raw materials and other purchased parts of approximately 104.8 million and 1.1 million which we expect to incur during 2025 and 2026, respectively. Additionally, we expect to invest to strengthen our systems, cybersecurity training, policies, programs, response plans and other similar measures. We expect to fund these cash requirements from cash on hand and cash generated from operations. 

Effect of Inflation 
 We experience changing price levels primarily related to purchased components and raw materials. During our fiscal year 2024, we experienced approximately 1 inflation as compared with our fiscal year 2023 for these inventory items. We anticipate inflation in raw and other material costs in 2025, including on purchased components, which is likely to have an adverse effect on our margins to the extent we are unable to pass on such higher costs to our customers. 
 During fiscal year 2024, we experienced approximately 3 labor inflation, which is slightly lower than the 3.8 released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

Seasonality 
 Our business is seasonal as a result of the impact of cold weather conditions. Net sales and operating income historically have been lowest in the three month periods ending December 31 and March 31 when the northern United States and most of Canada generally face weather conditions that restrict significant construction activity. See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Seasonal demand for certain of our products and services may adversely affect our financial results. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based upon experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur over time or the use of reasonably different estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates include the below items. 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Financial Statements 

Inventories, net 
 We record inventories at standard cost or estimated net realizable value. Standard cost reasonably approximates cost determined on the first-in, first-out basis. Inventory cost includes an overhead component that can be affected by levels of production and actual costs incurred. We evaluate the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. This evaluation includes such factors as anticipated usage, inventory levels and ultimate product sales value. If in our judgment persuasive evidence exists that the net realizable value of inventory is lower than its cost, the inventory value is written down to its estimated net realizable value. Significant judgments regarding future events and market conditions are made when estimating net realizable value. 
 Accounting for the Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
 We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. We perform this annual impairment testing on September 1, using standard valuation methodologies and rates that we consider to be reasonable and appropriate. 
 We evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative analysis. The carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, is compared with the estimated fair value of the reporting unit utilizing a combination of the income, market and cost approaches as applicable. The income approach, which is a level 3 fair value measurement, is based on projected debt-free cash flow which is discounted to the present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the cash flows. The market approach is based on the guideline public company method, which uses market multiples to value our reporting units. The cost approach is based on the net aggregate value of the reporting unit s underlying assets. 
 
 The income approach is dependent on management s best estimates of future operating results, including forecasted sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA margins and the selection of discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management's application of these assumptions. 
 
 We test our trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment using a royalty savings method, which is a variation of the discounted cash flow method. This method estimates a fair value by calculating an estimated discounted future cash flow stream from the hypothetical licensing of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If this estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. Conversely, if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, impairment is indicated. This analysis is dependent on management s best estimates of future operating results and the selection of reasonable discount rates and hypothetical royalty rates. 
 
 We performed our annual impairment testing at September 1, 2024. As a result of this quantitative testing, we recognized a 16.3 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge for a reporting unit within our Water Management Solutions segment as the carrying value exceeded its fair value. Our determination of the estimated fair value was based on our concluded value under the cost approach. Additionally, we performed our annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets at September 1, 2024 and recognized a 0.4 million non-cash impairment charge related to trade names within Water Management Solutions. Our testing indicated no other impairment. 
 
 Warranty Cost 
 We accrue for warranty expenses that may include customer costs of repair and/or replacement, including labor, materials, equipment, freight and reasonable overhead costs. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of sale if such costs are determined to be reasonably estimable at that time. Warranty cost estimates are revised throughout applicable warranty periods as better information regarding warranty costs becomes available. Critical factors in our analyses include warranty terms, specific claim situations, general incurred and projected failure rates, the nature of product failures, product and labor costs, and general business conditions. These estimates are inherently uncertain as they are based on historical data. If warranty claims are made in the current period for issues that have not historically been the subject of warranty claims and were not taken into consideration in establishing the accrual or if claims for issues already considered in establishing the accrual exceed expectations, warranty expense may exceed the accrual for that particular product. Additionally, a significant increase in costs to repair or replace could require additional warranty expense. We monitor and analyze our warranty experience and costs periodically and revise our warranty accrual as necessary. However, as we cannot predict actual future claims, the potential exists for the difference in any one reporting period to be material.

Contingencies 
 We are involved in litigation, investigations and claims arising in the normal course of business. We estimate and accrue liabilities resulting from such matters based on a variety of factors, including outstanding legal claims and proposed settlements; assessments by legal counsel of pending or threatened litigation; and assessments of potential environmental liabilities and remediation costs. We believe we have adequately accrued for these potential liabilities; however, facts and circumstances may change and could cause the actual liability to exceed estimates, or may require adjustments to the recorded liability balances in the future. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change as a result of such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For more information on these and other contingencies, see Note 15. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Item 1. BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters, Item 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Workers Compensation, Defined Benefit Pension Plans, Environmental and Other Long-term Liabilities 
 We are obligated for various liabilities that ultimately will be determined over what could be very long future time periods. We established the recorded liabilities for such items at September 30, 2024 using estimates for when such amounts will be paid and what the amounts of such payments will be. These estimates are subject to change based on numerous factors including, among others, claim development, regulatory changes, technology changes, the investment performance of related assets, longevity of participants, the discount rate used and changes to plan designs. 

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to various market risks, including potential losses arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, such as various commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. We manage our exposures to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures, and when appropriate, through the use of foreign exchange contracts. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Our primary financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents. This includes cash in banks and highly rated, liquid money market investments. We believe these instruments are not subject to material potential near-term losses in future earnings from reasonably possible near-term changes in market rates or prices. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Our products are made using various purchased components and several basic raw materials, including brass ingot, scrap steel, sand and resin. We expect prices for these items to fluctuate based on marketplace demand. Our product margins and level of profitability may fluctuate depending on our ability to sufficiently pass increases in purchased component and raw material costs on to our customers. To manage commodity price risks, we monitor commodity price fluctuations and may adjust our selling prices accordingly or implement certain supplier pricing agreements. In 2024, we experienced approximately 1 inflation compared to 2023. See Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-The prices of our purchased components and raw materials can be volatile. 
 Currency Risk 
 Our principal assets, liabilities and operations outside the United States are in Israel, Canada and China. Foreign reporting entities are remeasured into local currencies with the effect reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at currency exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, with the effect of such translation reflected in other comprehensive income (loss). Our stockholders equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the United States dollar against these non-United States currencies. Net sales and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into United States dollars at the average relevant foreign currency exchange rate during the period. We may, in future periods, use derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, those officers have concluded that, at September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework). After doing so, management concluded that, at September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at September 30, 2024 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in this Annual Report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Mueller Water Products, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mueller Water Products, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income , equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 20, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit s . We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Valuation of Goodwill Description of the Matter At September 30, 2024 , the Company s remaining goodwill balance was million and is within the Water Management Solutions segment. As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company performed its annual impairment test of the remaining goodwill and determined the reporting unit fair value using the discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach, and the guideline public company method, a form of the market approach. 
 
 Auditing management s estimate of the reporting unit fair value using the discounted cash flow method was complex due to the significant estimation involved in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value was sensitive to certain assumptions used by management to develop the projected financial information, including the forecasted earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins. This significant assumption is forward-looking and could be affected by future industry, market and economic conditions. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company s controls over review of the fair value of the reporting unit. This included testing controls over management s review of the significant assumption described above. 
 
 To test the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used to estimate fair value, testing the significant assumption used to develop the fair value estimate, and testing the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis for completeness and accuracy. For example, we evaluated management s forecasted EBITDA margins used in the fair value estimate by comparing the assumption to historical results and available market information. We also involved our valuation specialists to evaluate the valuation methodologies utilized. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the forecasted EBITDA margins to evaluate the potential change in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in this assumption.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2007.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Mueller Water Products, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited Mueller Water Products, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Mueller Water Products, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November 20, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 business segments: Water Flow Solutions and Water Management Solutions. Water Flow Solutions portfolio includes iron gate valves, specialty valves and service brass products. Water Management Solutions portfolio includes fire hydrants, repair and installation, natural gas, metering, leak detection, as well as pressure management and control products and solutions. The Company, we, us and our refer to Mueller Water Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries. With regard to the Company s segments, we, us and our may also refer to the segment being discussed. 
 We have approximately employees globally, of which approximately of our United States workers are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), which require us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, whenever we refer to a particular year, we mean our fiscal year ended or ending September 30 in that particular calendar year. 
 New Markets Tax Credit Program. On December 22, 2020, we entered into a financing transaction with Wells Fargo Community Investment Holdings, LLC Wells Fargo related to our brass foundry construction project in Decatur, Illinois under a qualified New Markets Tax Credit program NMTC ). The NMTC is a federal program intended to encourage capital investment in qualified lower income communities. Under the NMTC, investors claim federal income tax credits over a period of seven years in connection with qualified investments in the equity of community development entities CDE s), which are privately managed investment institutions that are certified to make qualified low-income community investments, such as in our foundry project. 
 Under the NMTC, Wells Fargo contributed capital of million to an investment fund and we loaned million to the fund. Wells Fargo is entitled to the associated tax credits, which are subject to 100 recapture if we do not comply with various regulations and contractual provisions surrounding the foundry project. We have indemnified Wells Fargo for any loss or recapture of tax credits related to the transaction until the seven-year period elapses. We do not anticipate any credit recaptures will be required in connection with this arrangement. 
 
 The investment fund contributed million cash for a 99.99 stake in a joint venture Sub-CDE with a CDE. The Sub-CDE then loaned million to us, with the use of the loan proceeds restricted to foundry project expenditures. This transaction also includes a put/call provision under which we may be obligated or entitled to repurchase Wells Fargo s interest in the investment fund. We believe that Wells Fargo will exercise its put option in December 2027 for nominal consideration, resulting in our becoming the sole owner of the investment fund, cancelling the related loans, and recognizing an estimated gain of million. 
 
 We determined that the investment fund and the Sub-CDE are variable interest entities VIEs and that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. The ongoing activities of the VIEs, namely collecting and remitting interest and fees and administering NMTC compliance, were contemplated in the initial design of the transaction and are not expected to significantly affect economic performance throughout the life of the VIEs. Additionally, we are obligated to deliver tax benefits and provide various other guarantees to Wells Fargo and to absorb the losses of the VIEs. Wells Fargo does not have a material interest in the underlying economics of the project. Consequently, we have included the financial statements of the VIEs in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Intercompany transactions between us and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation. Wells Fargo s contribution to the investment fund is consolidated in our financial statements within Other noncurrent liabilities as a result of its redemption features.

Leasehold improvements and capitalized leases are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term. Gains and losses upon disposition are reflected in operating results in the period of disposition. 
 Direct internal and external costs to implement computer systems and software for internal use are capitalized. Capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the system or software, generally , beginning when the system or software is ready for its intended use. 
 Liabilities are recognized at fair value for asset retirement obligations related to plant and landfill closures in the period in which they are reasonably estimable and the carrying amounts of the related long-lived assets are correspondingly adjusted. Over time, the liabilities are accreted to their estimated future values. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, asset retirement obligations were million.

Liabilities, including those related to claims incurred but not reported, are recorded principally using periodic valuations based on discounted future expected payments and using historical data combined with insurance industry data when historical data is limited. Our gross workers compensation liabilities were million as of September 30, 2024, and we expect to recover million in insurance and reimbursements which is included as a receivable in Other current assets and Other noncurrent assets.

We have elected to recognize the tax on GILTI in the period the tax is incurred.

Performance Obligations 
 A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Our performance obligations generally are satisfied at a point in time as related to sales of equipment and products and over time as related to our software hosting and leak detection monitoring services. Performance obligations are supported by customer contracts which provide frameworks for the nature of the distinct products or services. The transaction price is adjusted for our estimate of variable consideration which may include discounts and rebates. To estimate variable consideration, we apply the expected value or the most likely amount method, based on whichever method more appropriately predicts the amount of consideration we expect to receive. The method applied is typically based on historical experience and known trends. We constrain the amounts of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant

of our revenues in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022. The revenues recognized at a point in time related to the sale of our products and services are recognized when the obligations of the contract terms are satisfied, which is when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product or service, which generally occurs upon shipment when control of the product or service transfers to the customer. 
 Revenues from products and services transferred to customers over time represented of our revenues in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022. 
 We offer assurance warranties to our customers that the products provided will function as intended and comply with any agreed-upon specifications. These cannot be purchased separately. On limited products, we offer extended warranties which may be purchased separately. 
 Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract 
 Shipping and handling costs associated with freight activities after the customer has obtained control are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are expensed to Cost of sales within our consolidated statements of operations at the time revenue is recognized. 
 
 We incur certain incremental costs to obtain a contract, which primarily relate to incremental sales commissions. As the expected benefit associated with these incremental costs is generally one year or less based on the nature of the product sold and benefits received, we have applied the practical expedient to expense them as incurred and therefore do not capitalize the related costs. Our commissions are paid based on orders or shipments, and we reserve the right to claw back any commissions in the event of product returns or lost collections. 

Note 4. 
 . The terms and conditions of our leases may include options to extend or early terminate the lease. These factors are considered at lease inception or at the time of the amendment and included in the lease term when these options are reasonably certain of exercise. 
 We determine if a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception by evaluating whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset. For all classes of leased assets, we have elected the practical expedient to account for any non-lease components in the contract together with the related lease component in the same unit of account. 
 Right-of-Use ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Additionally, ROU assets include any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, as well as any initial direct costs incurred, and are reduced by any lease incentives received. As most of our operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, we apply our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of our remaining lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined based on information available at the lease commencement date. 
 For all classes of leased assets, we have applied an accounting policy election to exclude short-term leases from recognition in our consolidated balance sheets. A short-term lease has a term of 12 months or less at the commencement date and does not include a purchase or extension option that is reasonably certain of exercise. We recognize short-term lease cost in our consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 Our short-term lease cost for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 and short-term lease commitments at September 30, 2024, and 2023 are immaterial.

 Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis on September 1 of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. We test our trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment using a royalty savings method , which is an income approach using a variation of the discounted cash flow method. This method estimates a fair value by calculating an estimated discounted future cash flow stream from the hypothetical licensing of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, impairment is indicated. This analysis is dependent on management s best estimates of future revenue and the selection of reasonable discount rates and hypothetical royalty rates. 
 We performed our annual impairment testing at September 1, 2024 and recorded an impairment charge of million related to trade names within Water Management Solutions. The impairment was primarily as a result of lower forecasted cash flow streams from a lower hypothetical royalty rate and a change in the forecasted revenues from the product portfolio associated with certain trade names. 
 Intangible Assets 
 Direct internal and external costs to develop software used in the provision of services to customers by Water Management Solutions are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, beginning when the software is ready for its intended use. At September 30, 2024, the remaining weighted-average amortization period for this software was years. Amortization expense related to such software assets was million in 2024 and million in 2023 and 2022. Amortization expense for each of the next five years is expected to be million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027, million in 2028, and million in 2029. 
 At September 30, 2024, the remaining weighted-average amortization period for business combination-related finite-lived customer relationships and technology intangible assets were years and years, respectively. Amortization expense related to these assets was million, million and million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amortization expense for each of the next five years is scheduled to be million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027 and 2028 and million in 2029.

Other than for Krausz s investment in its United States subsidiary and other anticipated distributions which result cumulatively in immaterial income tax, we have not recorded income taxes for unrepatriated foreign earnings that may be subject to withholding tax or any outside cost basis differences inherent in our foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.

 We evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets each quarter considering results to date, projections of taxable income, tax planning strategies and reversing taxable temporary differences. 
 Our state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire between our fiscal years 2025 and 2027, remain available to offset future taxable earnings; however, we currently do not expect full utilization of certain state net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration. Consequently, we have recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset which is reflected in the table above.

million in borrowing capacity that matures the earlier of (a) March 16, 2029, which is ninety-one days prior to the stated maturity date of our Senior Notes if the Notes are still outstanding on that date or (b) March 28, 2029. The ABL includes the ability to borrow up to million of swing line loans and up to million of letters of credit. The ABL permits us to increase the size of the credit facility by an additional million in certain circumstances subject to adequate borrowing base availability. 
 In December 2023, we obtained a waiver under our ABL ABL Waiver to provide for additional time associated with certain reporting requirements that were delayed as a result of the cybersecurity incident announced on October 28, 2023. Under the ABL Waiver, the maximum aggregate amount of borrowings and other credit extensions under the ABL was limited to million at any time outstanding until all of the required reports were delivered. During our first fiscal quarter of 2024, we delivered the required reports, and on February 6, 2024, the ABL Waiver was terminated. Accordingly, we are no longer subject to any additional restrictions or borrowing limitations under the ABL, including the million temporary limit on credit extensions. 
 On March 28, 2024, we amended our ABL to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date from July 29, 2025 to the earlier of (a) March 28, 2029 and (b) 91 days prior to the stated maturity date of the Company s Senior Notes due June 15, 2029 (as may be extended from time to time in accordance with the Indenture governing the notes) if the Senior Notes are then outstanding, (ii) decrease the grid-based interest rate margins by approximately basis points to basis points for Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR loans and basis points for base rate loans when average availability is greater than of the aggregate revolving commitments, and to basis points for SOFR loans and basis points for base rate loans, when average availability is less than or equal to of the aggregate revolving credit commitments and (iii) replace the previously fixed basis point unused commitment fee with a grid-based, quarterly unused commitment fee equal to (a) basis points if average daily outstanding credit extensions for such quarter under the ABL Total Outstandings are less than or equal to of the aggregate revolving credit commitments or (b) basis points if Total Outstandings for such quarter are greater than or equal to of the aggregate revolving credit commitments. We incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs in connection with the ABL amendment which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the ABL. 
 Borrowings under the ABL bear interest at a floating rate equal to SOFR plus an adjustment of basis points and an applicable margin range of to basis points, or a base rate, as defined in the ABL, plus an applicable margin range of to basis points. At September 30, 2024, the applicable margin was basis points for SOFR-based loans, and basis points for base rate loans. 
 The ABL is subject to mandatory prepayments if total outstanding borrowings under the ABL are greater than the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility or if we dispose of overdue accounts receivable in certain circumstances. The borrowing base under the ABL is equal to the sum of (a) of the value of eligible accounts receivable and (b) the lesser of (i) of the value of eligible inventory or (ii) of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, less certain reserves. Prepayments can be made at any time without penalty. 
 Substantially all of our United States subsidiaries are borrowers under the ABL and are jointly and severally liable for outstanding borrowings. Our obligations under the ABL are secured by a first-priority perfected lien on all of our United States inventory, accounts receivable, certain cash balances and other supporting assets. 
 The ABL includes a commitment fee for any unused borrowing capacity of basis points per annum when the unused capacity is above 50 of the credit commitments, with a step down to basis points per annum when unused capacity is less than or equal to 50 of the credit commitments. At September 30, 2024, the commitment fee was basis points. 
 Borrowings are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants unless excess availability is less than the greater of million and of the Loan Cap as defined in the ABL. Excess availability based on September 30, 2024 data was million, as reduced by million of outstanding letters of credit and million of accrued fees and expenses. 
 
 Senior Unsecured Notes. On May 28, 2021, we privately issued million of Senior Notes, which mature on June 15, 2029 and bear interest at , paid semi-annually in June and December. We capitalized million of financing costs, which are being amortized over the term of the Senior Notes using the effective interest method. Proceeds from the Senior Notes, along with cash on hand were used to redeem our previously existing notes. Substantially all of our United States subsidiaries guarantee the Senior Notes, which are subordinate to borrowings under our ABL. Based on quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 measurement, the outstanding Senior Notes had a fair value of million as of September 30, 2024.

Senior Notes Indenture contains customary covenants and events of default, including covenants that limit our ability to incur certain debt and liens. There are no financial maintenance covenants associated with the Indenture. We believe we were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 
 We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time after June 15, 2024, at specified redemption prices. Upon a Change of Control as defined in the Indenture, we could be required to offer to purchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to of the outstanding principal amount if there is a Ratings Decline (as defined in the Indenture).

 Weighted average used to determine net periodic cost: 
 Discount rate 
 Expected return on plan assets 

The discount rate for determining the present value of pension obligations was selected using a bond settlement approach, which constructs a hypothetical bond portfolio that could be purchased such that the coupon payments and maturity values could be used to satisfy the projected benefit payments. The discount rate is the equivalent rate that results in the present value of the projected benefit payments equaling the market value of this bond portfolio. Only high quality (AA graded or higher), non-callable corporate bonds are included in this bond portfolio. We rely on the Pension Plan s actuaries to assist in the development of the discount rate model. 
 The expected return on plan assets is determined with the assistance of the Pension Plan s actuaries and investment consultants. Expected return on plan assets was developed using forward-looking returns over a time horizon of approximately years for major asset classes along with projected risk and historical correlations.

 Assets of the Pension Plan are allocated to various investments to attain diversification and reasonable risk-adjusted returns while also managing the exposure to asset and liability volatility. These ranges are targets and deviations may occur from time to time as a result of market fluctuations. Portfolio assets are typically rebalanced to the allocation targets at least annually. 
 The assets of the Pension Plan are primarily invested in mutual funds and investment trusts valued at net asset value, which in turn hold fixed income and equity investments. The valuation methodologies used to measure the assets of the Pension Plan at fair value are: 
 Mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market; 
 Fixed income fund investments held by the investment trusts are valued using the closing price reported in the active market in which the investment is traded. When market quotations are not readily available, these assets are valued by a method the trustees believe accurately reflects fair value.

 At September 30, 2024, there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock-based awards not yet vested. We expect to recognize this expense over a weighted average life of approximately years. 
 The Mueller Water Products, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan 2006 Plan authorizes an aggregate of shares of common stock that may be granted through the issuance of stock-based awards. Any awards canceled are available for reissuance. Generally, all of our employees and members of our Board of Directors are eligible to participate in the 2006 Plan. At September 30, 2024, shares of common stock were available for future grants of awards under the 2006 Plan. This total assumes that the maximum number of shares will be earned for awards for which the final number of shares to be earned has not yet been determined. 
 An award granted under the 2006 Plan vests at such times and in such installments as set by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors Compensation Committee ), but no award will be exercisable after the -year anniversary of the date on which it is granted. Management expects some instruments will be forfeited prior to vesting. Grants to members of our Board of Directors are expected to vest fully.

Compensation expense for restricted stock units is recognized between the grant date and the vesting date (or the date on which a participant becomes retirement-eligible, if sooner) on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award.

 Performance-Based Awards. Our performance-based awards consist of performance-based restricted stock units PRSUs ). PRSUs represent a target number of units that may be paid out at the end of a multi-year award cycle consisting of annual performance periods coinciding with our fiscal years. As determined at the date of award, PRSUs may settle in cash-value equivalent of, or directly in, shares of our common stock. Settlement will range from to times the number of PRSUs granted, depending on our financial performance against predetermined targets. The grant date for each year s performance period is set when the Compensation Committee establishes performance goals for the period, normally within 90 days of the beginning of each performance period. At the end of the performance period, the Compensation Committee confirms performance against the applicable performance targets. PRSUs do not convey voting rights or earn dividends. PRSUs vest on the last day of an award cycle, unless vested sooner as a result of a Change of Control of the Company, or the death, disability or retirement of a participant. 
 We recognize compensation expense for stock-settled PRSUs starting on the first day of the applicable performance period and ending on the respective vesting dates. We base the recognized compensation expense upon the number of units awarded for each performance period, the closing price of our common stock on the grant date and the estimated performance factor. In 2024, shares vested related to PRSUs. In 2023 and 2022, and shares, respectively, vested related to PRSUs.

 Market-Based Awards. Our market-based awards consist of market-based restricted stock units MRSUs ).

Settlements in our common shares will range from to times the number of MRSUs granted, depending on our TSR performance ranking within the peer group. The fair values of MRSUs are fixed at the date of grant and the related expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period, which is roughly three years from the date of grant.

 Cybersecurity Incident Putative Class Action. In connection with the cybersecurity incident initially reported on October 28, 2023, the Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit captioned David Kok v. Mueller Water Products, Inc., filed on August 30, 2024 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, Case No. 1:24-cv-03894-SCJ. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all Company current and former employees whose personally identifying information was allegedly compromised by the incident. The lawsuit asserts various common law tort, contract and state statutory claims, seeks monetary damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, costs and attorneys fees and other related relief. We believe the allegations are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the claims; however, the outcome of this legal proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty. 
 Indemnifications . We are a party to contracts in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract. In some cases, this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but usually excludes any liabilities caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct. We cannot estimate the potential amount of future payments under these indemnities until events arise that would trigger a liability under the indemnities. 
 Additionally, in connection with the sale of assets and the divestiture of businesses, such as the divestitures of U.S. Pipe and Anvil, we may agree to indemnify buyers and related parties for certain losses or liabilities incurred by these parties with respect to: (i) the representations and warranties made by us to these parties in connection with the sale and (ii) liabilities related to the pre-closing operations of the assets or business sold. Indemnities related to pre-closing operations generally include certain environmental and tax liabilities and other liabilities not assumed by these parties in the transaction. 
 
 Indemnities related to the pre-closing operations of sold assets or businesses normally do not represent additional liabilities to us, but simply serve to protect these parties from potential liability associated with our obligations existing at the time of the sale. As with any liability, we have accrued for those pre-closing obligations that are considered probable and reasonably estimable. Should circumstances change, increasing the likelihood of payments related to a specific indemnity, we will accrue a liability when future payment is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. 
 
 Other Matters. We monitor and analyze our warranty experience and costs periodically and may revise our accruals as necessary. Factors considered in our analyses include warranty terms, specific claim situations, general incurred and projected failure rates, the nature of product failures, product and labor costs, and general business conditions.

In the event of financial impropriety by the Participant that results in a restatement of the financial statements of the Company for any applicable period (the Applicable Period ), as determined by the Audit Committee or the Company s independent registered public accounting firm; then, if the award granted hereby is made during the Applicable Period or within 90 days after the end of such Applicable Period, the number of Market Units granted hereunder shall be reduced by a fraction: (i) The numerator of which is the amount of operating income decline for the Applicable Period caused by such restatement or breach, and (ii) The denominator of which is the amount of operating income previously determined for the Applicable Period, or if the breach does not result in a decrease in the amount of operating income, the fraction shall be 50 . If Market Units have already vested under this Agreement, then the reduction contemplated by this Section 21(b) shall be applied first to the remaining Market Units that have not vested, pro rata, and second to the vested shares and the Participant shall repay the Company by forfeiting to the Company a number of excess shares received that 

#17482 12 would have exceeded the amount granted hereby, to be taken from the most recent vesting of Market Units or, if such shares have been sold, the proceeds received from the sale of such shares that would otherwise have been forfeited. c. In addition to the foregoing, if the Participant has realized any profits from the sale of other Company s securities during the 12-month period prior to the discovery of breach or financial impropriety referred to above, the Participant shall reimburse the Company for those profits to the extent required by the Company s Clawback Policy. d.

It is expressly understood that the Committee is authorized to administer, construe and make all determinations necessary or appropriate to the administration of the Plan and this Agreement, all of which shall be binding upon the Participant. b. The Committee may terminate, amend or modify the Plan and this Agreement under the terms of and as set forth in the Plan. c. The Participant may elect, subject to any procedural rules adopted by the Committee, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold and sell shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined, equal to the amount required to be withheld, subject to the restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws and Company policies regarding trading in its shares. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold from the Participant s compensation, or require him or her to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant s FICA obligation), domestic or foreign, required by law to be withheld with respect to any payout to him or her under this Agreement. 

#17482 13 d. The Participant agrees to take all steps necessary to comply with all applicable provisions of federal and state securities laws in exercising his or her rights under this Agreement. e.

To the extent not preempted by the laws of the United States, the laws of the State of Delaware shall be the controlling law in all matters relating to this Agreement without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws. i. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Covenants and other provisions contained herein are reasonable and valid and do not impose limitations greater than those that are necessary to protect the business interests and Confidential Information of the Company. The Company and the Participant agree that the invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more of the Covenants, other provisions, or parts thereof of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof, all of which are inserted conditionally on their being valid in law, and in the event one or more Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof contained herein shall be invalid, this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof had not been inserted. The Participant and the Company agree that the Covenants and other provisions contained in this Agreement are severable and divisible, that none of such Covenants or provisions depend on any other Covenant or provision for their enforceability, that each such Covenant and provision constitutes an enforceable obligation between the Company and the Participant, that each such Covenant and provision shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other Covenant or provision of this Agreement, and that the existence of any claim or cause of action by one party to this Agreement against another party to this Agreement, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute 

#17482 14 a defense to the enforcement by any party to this Agreement of any such Covenant or provision. j. If any of the provisions contained in this Agreement relating to the Covenants or other provisions contained herein, or any part thereof, are determined to be unenforceable because of the length of any period of time, the size of any area, the scope of activities or similar term contained therein, then such period of time, area, scope of activities or similar term shall be considered to be adjusted to a period of time, area, scope of activities or similar term which would cure such invalidity, and such Covenant or provision in its reduced form shall then be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. k. This Agreement is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and shall be construed accordingly. To the extent that any amount or benefit that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and that is not exempt under Section 409A, is otherwise payable or distributable to him or her on account of separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) while he or she is a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), such amount or benefit shall be settled or distributed on the later of time for payment described in Section 4 of this Agreement and that date which is six (6) months after the date of such separation from service. l. The parties agree that the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement constitute good and valuable consideration. [Signature Page Follows] 

#17482 15 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed effective as of the Date of Grant. Mueller Water Products, Inc. By: J. Scott Hall President and Chief Executive Officer ATTEST: Participant 

#17482 16 EXHIBIT A Market Units and Performance Period The Participant has been awarded the number of performance restricted stock units Market Units identified in Table 1 below. Each Market Unit that vests will be settled in the Company s common shares based upon relative total shareholder return performance over the identified Performance Period. The performance period for the Market Units shall be the Award Cycle, i.e. the three fiscal years of the Award Cycle Performance Period ). Table 1 Market Unit Award Performance Period Number of Market Units Awarded Total Maximum Number of Shares Total Target Number of Shares Total Threshold Number of Shares Month Day, Year - Month Day, Year x 2x x .5x Performance Criteria The Market Units shall be Vested at the end of the Performance Period; provided that the Participant remains in Continuous Service to the Company. Vested Market Units will be settled in company shares according to a formula based on the Share Payout Ratio Percentages as set forth below. Table 2 Market Unit Performance Targets Performance rTSR Percentile Rank Goal rTSR Quartile Rank Goal Share Payout Ratio Percentage of Target Earned Number of Shares Earned Maximum 75th + 4th 200 Target 50th 3rd 100 Threshold 25th 2nd 50 Below Threshold 

#17482 17 establishing the plan payout and (ii) if a company is acquired at any time during the Performance Period, the company shall be removed when establishing the plan payout. The rTSR Percentile Rank is the percentage of total shareholder returns of the Peer Group calculated that are lower than the total shareholder return for the Performance Period (e.g., if the total shareholder return is greater than 75 of the total shareholder returns of the members of the Peer Group, the rTSR Percentile Ranking is the 75th percentile or 4th quartile). Total Shareholder Return TSR shall be calculated in the following manner: TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends Paid) / Beginning Stock Price 1. Beginning Stock Price shall mean the average of the closing prices for each of the twenty (20) trading days immediately prior to the first day of the Performance Period; 2. Ending Stock Price shall mean the average of closing prices for each of the last twenty (20) trading days of the Performance Period; 3. Change in Stock Price shall equal the Ending Stock Price minus the Beginning Stock Price; 4. Dividends Paid shall mean the total of all dividends paid on one (1) share of stock during the Performance Period, provided that dividends shall be treated as though they are reinvested; 5. In all events, TSR shall be adjusted to give effect to any stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, spin-offs and similar transactions. If the Company achieves an rTSR for the Performance Period at or above the Threshold Percentile Rank Goal specified in Table 2 herein, the Share Payout Ratio Percentage to be used to determine the number of shares earned shall be calculated as follows: (i) if the rTSR meets or exceeds the Threshold Percentile Rank Goal, but does not meet the Target Percentile Rank Goal specified in Table 2 herein, then the Share Payout Ratio Percentage for such Performance Period shall be interpolated on a straight-line basis between Threshold Share Payout Ratio specified in Table 2 herein and Target Share Payout Ratio specified in Table 2 herein and (ii) if the rTSR meets or exceeds the Target Percentile Rank Goal but does not meet the Maximum Percentile Rank Goal, then the Share Payout Ratio Percentage for such Performance Period shall be interpolated on a straight-line basis between the Target Share Payout Ratio and Maximum Share Payout Ratio specified in Table 2 herein. For the avoidance of doubt, 200 being the maximum Share Payout Ratio and if rTSR for the Performance Period is below Threshold Percentile Rank Goal, the Share Payout Ratio shall be zero (0) and no shares shall be issued for the Performance Period.

In the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Participant or a material breach of Company policy (including and subject to the Company s Clawback Policy as in effect from time to time) or laws or regulations that could result in a termination for cause (whether or not the Participant is terminated), then the Performance shares granted hereby shall be void and of no effect, unless the Committee determines otherwise. b. In the event of financial impropriety by the Participant that results in a restatement of the financial statements of the Company for any applicable period (the Applicable Period ), as determined by the Audit Committee or the Company s independent registered public accounting firm; then, if the award granted hereby is made during the Applicable Period or within 90 days after the end of such Applicable Period, the number of Market Units granted hereunder shall be reduced by a fraction: (i) The numerator of which is the amount of operating income decline for the Applicable Period caused by such restatement or breach, and (ii) The denominator of which is the amount of operating income previously determined for the Applicable Period, or if the breach does not result in a decrease in the amount of operating income, the fraction shall be 50 . If Market Units have already vested under this Agreement, then the reduction contemplated by this Section 21(b) shall be applied first to the remaining Market Units that have not vested, pro rata, and second to the vested shares and the Participant shall repay the Company by forfeiting to the Company a number of excess shares received that 

#18461 12 would have exceeded the amount granted hereby, to be taken from the most recent vesting of Market Units or, if such shares have been sold, the proceeds received from the sale of such shares that would otherwise have been forfeited. c. In addition to the foregoing, if the Participant has realized any profits from the sale of other Company s securities during the 12-month period prior to the discovery of breach or financial impropriety referred to above, the Participant shall reimburse the Company for those profits to the extent required by the Company s Clawback Policy. d.

Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy, as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time or any successor thereto (referred to hereinabove as the Clawback Policy ), the provisions of which are hereby incorporated by reference. However, in the event any provision of this Section 21 is determined to be in conflict or inconsistent with any provision of the Clawback Policy, the provision of this Section 21 or the Clawback Policy, as the case may be, imposing the greater obligation on the Participant or, to the extent applicable, granting the greater rights and remedies to the Company shall control. Participant acknowledges having been provided with a copy of the Clawback Policy as in effect on the Date of Award. 22. Miscellaneous. a. This Agreement and the rights of the Participant hereunder are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time, as well as to such rules and regulations as the Committee may adopt for administration of the Plan. The Committee shall have the right to impose such restrictions on any shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement, as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions under applicable federal securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such shares are then listed and/or traded, under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such shares.

Except as provided in the third paragraph of this Agreement, this Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between the Participant and the Company regarding the Market Units granted hereunder. Except as provided in the third paragraph of this Agreement, this Agreement and the Plan supersede any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the Market Units granted hereunder. g.

The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Covenants and other provisions contained herein are reasonable and valid and do not impose limitations greater than those that are necessary to protect the business interests and Confidential Information of the Company. The Company and the Participant agree that the invalidity or unenforceability of any 

#18461 14 one or more of the Covenants, other provisions, or parts thereof of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof, all of which are inserted conditionally on their being valid in law, and in the event one or more Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof contained herein shall be invalid, this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof had not been inserted.

If any of the provisions contained in this Agreement relating to the Covenants or other provisions contained herein, or any part thereof, are determined to be unenforceable because of the length of any period of time, the size of any area, the scope of activities or similar term contained therein, then such period of time, area, scope of activities or similar term shall be considered to be adjusted to a period of time, area, scope of activities or similar term which would cure such invalidity, and such Covenant or provision in its reduced form shall then be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. k.

#18461 15 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed effective as of the Date of Award. Mueller Water Products, Inc. By: Marietta Edmunds Zakas President and Chief Executive Officer ATTEST: Participant 

#18461 16 EXHIBIT A Market Units and Performance Period The Participant has been awarded the number of performance restricted stock units Market Units identified in Table 1 below. Each Market Unit that vests will be settled in the Company s common shares based upon relative total shareholder return performance over the identified Performance Period. The performance period for the Market Units shall be the Award Cycle, i.e. the three fiscal years of the Award Cycle Performance Period ). Table 1 Market Unit Award Performance Period Number of Market Units Awarded Total Maximum Number of Shares Total Target Number of Shares Total Threshold Number of Shares Month Day, Year - Month Day, Year x 2x x .5x Performance Criteria The Market Units shall be Vested at the end of the Performance Period; provided that the Participant remains in Continuous Service to the Company. Vested Market Units will be settled in company shares according to a formula based on the Share Payout Ratio Percentages as set forth below. Table 2 Market Unit Performance Targets Performance rTSR Percentile Rank Goal rTSR Quartile Rank Goal Share Payout Ratio Percentage of Target Earned Number of Shares Earned Maximum 75th + 4th 200 Target 50th 3rd 100 Threshold 25th 2nd 50 Below Threshold 

#18461 17 establishing the plan payout and (ii) if a company is acquired at any time during the Performance Period, the company shall be removed when establishing the plan payout. The rTSR Percentile Rank is the percentage of total shareholder returns of the Peer Group calculated that are lower than the total shareholder return for the Performance Period (e.g., if the total shareholder return is greater than 75 of the total shareholder returns of the members of the Peer Group, the rTSR Percentile Ranking is the 75th percentile or 4th quartile). Total Shareholder Return TSR shall be calculated in the following manner: TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends Paid) / Beginning Stock Price 1. Beginning Stock Price shall mean the average of the closing prices for each of the twenty (20) trading days immediately prior to the first day of the Performance Period; 2. Ending Stock Price shall mean the average of closing prices for each of the last twenty (20) trading days of the Performance Period; 3. Change in Stock Price shall equal the Ending Stock Price minus the Beginning Stock Price; 4. Dividends Paid shall mean the total of all dividends paid on one (1) share of stock during the Performance Period, provided that dividends shall be treated as though they are reinvested; 5. In all events, TSR shall be adjusted to give effect to any stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, spin-offs and similar transactions. If the Company achieves an rTSR for the Performance Period at or above the Threshold Percentile Rank Goal specified in Table 2 herein, the Share Payout Ratio Percentage to be used to determine the number of shares earned shall be calculated as follows: (i) if the rTSR meets or exceeds the Threshold Percentile Rank Goal, but does not meet the Target Percentile Rank Goal specified in Table 2 herein, then the Share Payout Ratio Percentage for such Performance Period shall be interpolated on a straight-line basis between Threshold Share Payout Ratio specified in Table 2 herein and Target Share Payout Ratio specified in Table 2 herein and (ii) if the rTSR meets or exceeds the Target Percentile Rank Goal but does not meet the Maximum Percentile Rank Goal, then the Share Payout Ratio Percentage for such Performance Period shall be interpolated on a straight-line basis between the Target Share Payout Ratio and Maximum Share Payout Ratio specified in Table 2 herein. For the avoidance of doubt, 200 being the maximum Share Payout Ratio and if rTSR for the Performance Period is below Threshold Percentile Rank Goal, the Share Payout Ratio shall be zero (0) and no shares shall be issued for the Performance Period.

In the event of financial impropriety by the Participant that results in a restatement of the financial statements of the Company for any applicable period (the Applicable Period ), as determined by the Audit Committee or the Company s independent registered public accounting firm; then, if the award granted hereby is made during the Applicable Period or within 90 days after the end of such Applicable Period, the number of Performance RSUs granted hereunder shall be reduced by a fraction: (i) The numerator of which is the amount of operating income decline for the Applicable Period caused by such restatement or breach, and (ii) The denominator of which is the amount of operating income previously determined for the Applicable Period, or if the breach does not result in a decrease in the amount of operating income, the fraction shall be 50 . 

11 If Performance RSUs have already vested under this Agreement, then the reduction contemplated by this Section 21(b) shall be applied first to the remaining Performance RSUs that have not vested, pro rata, and second to the vested shares and the Participant shall repay the Company by forfeiting to the Company a number of excess shares received that would have exceeded the amount granted hereby, to be taken from the most recent vesting of Performance RSUs or, if such shares have been sold, the proceeds received from the sale of such shares that would otherwise have been forfeited. c.

The Participant may elect, subject to any procedural rules adopted by the Committee, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold and sell shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined, equal to the amount required to be withheld, subject to the restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws and Company policies regarding trading in its shares. 

12 The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold from the Participant s compensation, or require him or her to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant s FICA obligation), domestic or foreign, required by law to be withheld with respect to any payout to him or her under this Agreement. d. The Participant agrees to take all steps necessary to comply with all applicable provisions of federal and state securities laws in exercising his or her rights under this Agreement. e.

To the extent not preempted by the laws of the United States, the laws of the State of Delaware shall be the controlling law in all matters relating to this Agreement without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws. i. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Covenants and other provisions contained herein are reasonable and valid and do not impose limitations greater than those that are necessary to protect the business interests and Confidential Information of the Company. The Company and the Participant agree that the invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more of the Covenants, other provisions, or parts thereof of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof, all of which are inserted conditionally on their being valid in law, and in the event one or more Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof contained herein shall be invalid, this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof had not been inserted.

13 provision constitutes an enforceable obligation between the Company and the Participant, that each such Covenant and provision shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other Covenant or provision of this Agreement, and that the existence of any claim or cause of action by one party to this Agreement against another party to this Agreement, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by any party to this Agreement of any such Covenant or provision. j. If any of the provisions contained in this Agreement relating to the Covenants or other provisions contained herein, or any part thereof, are determined to be unenforceable because of the length of any period of time, the size of any area, the scope of activities or similar term contained therein, then such period of time, area, scope of activities or similar term shall be considered to be adjusted to a period of time, area, scope of activities or similar term which would cure such invalidity, and such Covenant or provision in its reduced form shall then be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. k.

8 The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information is necessary for the Company s ability to compete with its competitors. The Participant further acknowledges and agrees that the prohibitions against disclosure and use of Confidential Information recited herein are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights or remedies that the Company or a Subsidiary may have available pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware to prevent the disclosure of trade secrets or proprietary information, including but not limited to the Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act, 6 Del. Code Ann. 2001, et seq.

In the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Participant or a material breach of Company policy (including and subject to the Company s Clawback Policy as in effect from time to time) or laws or regulations that could result in a termination for cause (whether or not the Participant is terminated), then the Performance shares granted hereby shall be void and of no effect, unless the Committee determines otherwise. b. In the event of financial impropriety by the Participant that results in a restatement of the financial statements of the Company for any applicable period (the Applicable Period ), as determined by the Audit Committee or the Company s independent registered public accounting firm; then, if the award granted hereby is made during the Applicable Period or within 90 days after the end of such Applicable Period, the number of Performance RSUs granted hereunder shall be reduced by a fraction: (i) The numerator of which is the amount of operating income decline for the Applicable Period caused by such restatement or breach, and (ii) The denominator of which is the amount of operating income previously determined for the Applicable Period, or if the breach does not result in a decrease in the amount of operating income, the fraction shall be 50 . 

11 If Performance RSUs have already vested under this Agreement, then the reduction contemplated by this Section 21(b) shall be applied first to the remaining Performance RSUs that have not vested, pro rata, and second to the vested shares and the Participant shall repay the Company by forfeiting to the Company a number of excess shares received that would have exceeded the amount granted hereby, to be taken from the most recent vesting of Performance RSUs or, if such shares have been sold, the proceeds received from the sale of such shares that would otherwise have been forfeited. c. In addition to the foregoing, if the Participant has realized any profits from the sale of other Company s securities during the 12-month period prior to the discovery of breach or financial impropriety referred to above, the Participant shall reimburse the Company for those profits to the extent required by the Company s Clawback Policy. d. The Company shall have the right to offset future compensation including at its sole discretion stock compensation to recover any amounts that may be recovered by the Company hereunder. e.

Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy, as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time or any successor thereto (referred to hereinabove as the Clawback Policy ), the provisions of which are hereby incorporated by reference. However, in the event any provision of this Section 21 is determined to be in conflict or inconsistent with any provision of the Clawback Policy, the provision of this Section 21 or the Clawback Policy, as the case may be, imposing the greater obligation on the Participant or, to the extent applicable, granting the greater rights and remedies to the Company shall control. Participant acknowledges having been provided with a copy of the Clawback Policy as in effect on the Date of Award. 22. Miscellaneous. a. This Agreement and the rights of the Participant hereunder are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time, as well as to such rules and regulations as the Committee may adopt for administration of the Plan. The Committee shall have the right to impose such restrictions on any shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement, as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions under applicable federal securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such shares are then listed and/or traded, 

12 under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such shares.

Except as provided in the third paragraph of this Agreement, this Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between the Participant and the Company regarding the Performance RSUs granted hereunder. Except as provided in the third paragraph of this Agreement, this Agreement and the Plan supersede any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the Performance RSUs granted hereunder. g. All rights and obligations of the Company under the Plan and this Agreement, shall inure to the benefit of and be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. h. To the extent not preempted by the laws of the United States, the laws of the State of Delaware shall be the controlling law in all matters relating to this Agreement without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws. 

13 i. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Covenants and other provisions contained herein are reasonable and valid and do not impose limitations greater than those that are necessary to protect the business interests and Confidential Information of the Company. The Company and the Participant agree that the invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more of the Covenants, other provisions, or parts thereof of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof, all of which are inserted conditionally on their being valid in law, and in the event one or more Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof contained herein shall be invalid, this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof had not been inserted. The Participant and the Company agree that the Covenants and other provisions contained in this Agreement are severable and divisible, that none of such Covenants or provisions depend on any other Covenant or provision for their enforceability, that each such Covenant and provision constitutes an enforceable obligation between the Company and the Participant, that each such Covenant and provision shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other Covenant or provision of this Agreement, and that the existence of any claim or cause of action by one party to this Agreement against another party to this Agreement, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by any party to this Agreement of any such Covenant or provision. j. If any of the provisions contained in this Agreement relating to the Covenants or other provisions contained herein, or any part thereof, are determined to be unenforceable because of the length of any period of time, the size of any area, the scope of activities or similar term contained therein, then such period of time, area, scope of activities or similar term shall be considered to be adjusted to a period of time, area, scope of activities or similar term which would cure such invalidity, and such Covenant or provision in its reduced form shall then be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. k. This Agreement is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and shall be construed accordingly.

The parties agree that the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement constitute good and valuable consideration.

This grant of RSUs shall not confer any right to the Participant (or any other participant) to be granted RSUs or other Awards in the future under the Plan. 

2 2. Vesting. (a) Vesting Without Termination of Continuous Service. One-third of the RSUs shall vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the Date of Grant, provided that such anniversary date falls on a trading date (defined for this purpose as a date on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for the transaction of business) or, if not, on the next trading date (each a vesting date ), subject to the Participant s Continuous Service on each such date. (b) No Fractional RSUs.

(c) Termination of Continuous Service. In the event of the Participant s termination of Continuous Service for any reason during the Period of Restriction (other than by reason of the Participant s death, Disability or Retirement, or after a Change of Control), all RSUs held by the Participant at the time of his or her termination of Continuous Service and still subject to the Period of Restriction shall be forfeited to the Company.

In the event (i) the Participant terminates Continuous Service by reason of Retirement or (ii) the Company terminates the Participant on or after the Participant first becomes Retirement eligible for any reason other than for Cause, and the Participant was in Continuous Service from the Grant Date through at least the first anniversary of the Grant Date, the number of RSUs that would otherwise vest on each vesting date shall be settled with the Participant within sixty (60) days following each such vesting date as if the Participant had remained in Continuous Service; provided, however, that such termination of Continuous Service also constitutes a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. By way of example, (i) if a Participant who received a grant of RSUs (scheduled to vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date) on December 1, 2018 terminates Continuous Service by reason of Retirement on December 2, 2019, then the remaining outstanding RSUs will vest and be settled according to the original vesting schedule on December 1, 2020 and December 1, 2021 and (ii) if this same Participant terminates Continuous Service on November 30, 2019, then none of the RSUs subject to the grant will vest and all will be forfeited to the Company.

4 other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, except as provided in the Plan. If any Transfer, whether voluntary or involuntary, of RSUs is made, or if any attachment, execution, garnishment, or lien shall be issued against or placed upon the RSUs, the Participant s right to such RSUs shall be immediately forfeited by the Participant to the Company, and this Agreement shall lapse. 7. Recapitalization. In the event of any change in the capitalization of the Company such as a stock split or corporate transaction such as any merger, consolidation, separation, or otherwise, the number and class of RSUs subject to this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee, as set forth in the Plan, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights. 8.

Non-Solicitation of Employees. During the term of the Participant s employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries and the Restricted Period, the Participant shall not, either on Participant s own behalf or for any person, entity, business or enterprise within the Territory: (a) solicit any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries with whom the Participant had material contact during the two (2) years prior to Participant s termination of employment to leave his or her employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries; or (b) induce or attempt to induce any such employee to breach any employment agreement with the Company. 12.

The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information is necessary for the Company s ability to compete with its competitors. The Participant further acknowledges and agrees that the prohibitions against disclosure and use of Confidential Information recited herein are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights or remedies that the Company or a Subsidiary may have available pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware to prevent the disclosure of trade secrets or proprietary information, including but not limited to the Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act, 6 Del.

Dispute Resolution; Agreement to Arbitrate. (a) The Participant and the Company agree that final and binding arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for any controversy, dispute, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement. (b) This Section covers all claims and actions of whatever nature, both at law and in equity, including, but not limited to, any claim for breach of contract (including this Agreement), and includes claims against the Participant and claims against the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or any parents, affiliates, owners, officers, directors, employees, agents, general partners or limited partners of the Company, to the extent such claims involve, in any way, this Agreement. This Section covers all judicial claims that could be brought by either party to this Agreement, but does not cover the filing of charges with government agencies that prohibit waiver of the right to file a charge. (c) The arbitration proceeding will be administered by a single arbitrator (the Arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, taking into account the need for speed and confidentiality. The Arbitrator shall be an attorney or judge with experience in contract litigation and selected pursuant to the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association. (d) The place and situs of arbitration shall be Wilmington, Delaware (or such other location as may be mutually agreed to by the parties). The 

9 Arbitrator may adopt the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, but shall be entitled to deviate from such rules in the Arbitrator s sole discretion in the interest of a speedy resolution of any dispute or as the Arbitrator shall deem just. The parties agree to facilitate the arbitration by (a) making available to each other and to the Arbitrator for inspection and review all documents, books and records as the Arbitrator shall determine to be relevant to the dispute, (b) making individuals under their control available to other parties and the Arbitrator and (c) observing strictly the time periods established by the Arbitrator for the submission of evidence and pleadings. The Arbitrator shall have the power to render declaratory judgments, as well as to award monetary claims, provided that the Arbitrator shall not have the power to act (i) outside the prescribed scope of this Agreement, or (ii) without providing an opportunity to each party to be represented before the Arbitrator. (e) The Arbitrator s award shall be in writing. The arbitrator shall allocate the costs and expenses of the proceedings between the parties and shall award interest as the Arbitrator deems appropriate. The arbitration judgment shall be final and binding on the parties. Judgment on the Arbitrator s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. (f) The Participant and the Company agree and understand that by executing this Agreement and agreeing to this Arbitration provision, they are giving up their rights to trial by jury for any dispute related to this Agreement. 19. Clawback. (a) In the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Participant or a material breach of Company policy (including the Company s Clawback Policy as in effect from time to time) or laws or regulations that could result in a termination for cause (whether or not the Participant is terminated), then the RSUs granted hereby shall be void and of no effect, unless the Committee determines otherwise. (b) In the event of financial impropriety by the Participant that results in a restatement of the financial statements of the Company for any applicable period (the Applicable Period ), as determined by the Audit Committee or the Company s independent registered public accounting firm; then, if the award granted hereby is made during the Applicable Period or within 90 days after the end of such Applicable Period, the number of RSUs granted hereunder shall be reduced by a fraction: (i) The numerator of which is the amount of operating income decline for the Applicable Period caused by such restatement or breach, and 

10 (ii) The denominator of which is the amount of operating income previously determined for the Applicable Period, or if the breach does not result in a decrease in the amount of operating income, the fraction shall be 50 . If RSUs have already vested under this Agreement, then the reduction contemplated by this Section 19(b) shall be applied first to the remaining RSUs that have not vested, pro rata, and second to the vested shares and the Participant shall repay the Company by forfeiting to the Company a number of excess shares received that would have exceeded the amount granted hereby, to be taken from the most recent vesting of RSUs or, if such shares have been sold, the proceeds received from the sale of such shares that would otherwise have been forfeited. As an example of the foregoing, assume the Participant is granted an award of 300 RSUs on December 1, 2018, which vest equally on December 1, 2019, December 1, 2020 and December 1,2021. If the Company discovers a breach or financial impropriety by the Participant on June 30, 2020, which leads to a 50 decrease in operating income for the 2018 fiscal year and which could not result in termination for Cause, then the award granted would be reduced to 150 RSUs, and the reduction would be applied equally to the remaining RSUs, which would mean that the 100 RSUs vesting on December 1, 2020 would be reduced by 75 to 25 RSUs and the 100 remaining RSUs vesting on December 1, 2021 would be reduced by 75 to 25 RSUs. If the Company discovers a breach or financial impropriety by the Participant on June 30, 2021, which leads to a 50 decrease in operating income for the 2018 fiscal year and which could not result in termination for Cause, then the award granted would be reduced to 150 RSUs, which would be applied to the remaining RSUs, which would mean that the 100 RSUs vesting on December 1, 2021 would be reduced by 100 RSUs to 0 RSUs and the Participant would forfeit 50 shares to the Company, taken from the most recent vesting on December 1, 2020, or if such shares had been sold, the Participant would pay to the Company the proceeds received from the sale of those 50 shares. (c) In addition to the foregoing, if the Participant has realized any profits from the sale of other Company s securities during the 12-month period prior to the discovery of breach or financial impropriety referred to above, the Participant shall reimburse the Company for those profits to the extent required by the Company s Clawback Policy. 

11 (d) The Company shall have the right to offset future compensation, including, at its sole discretion, stock compensation, to recover any amounts that may be recovered by the Company hereunder. (e) The provisions of this Section 19 are supplemental to the Participant s obligations under, and the rights and remedies of the Company set forth in, any applicable compensation, clawback, recoupment or similar policies as may be adopted by the Company or its Affiliates in effect from time to time, including, without limitation, the Mueller Water Products, Inc. Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy, as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time or any successor thereto (referred to hereinabove as the Clawback Policy ), the provisions of which are hereby incorporated by reference. However, in the event any provision of this Section 19 is determined to be in conflict or inconsistent with any provision of the Clawback Policy, the provision of this Section 19 or the Clawback Policy, as the case may be, imposing the greater obligation on the Participant or, to the extent applicable, granting the greater rights and remedies to the Company shall control. Participant acknowledges having been provided with a copy of the Clawback Policy as in effect on the Date of Grant. 20. Miscellaneous. (a) This Agreement and the rights of the Participant hereunder are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time, as well as to such rules and regulations as the Committee may adopt for administration of the Plan. The Committee shall have the right to impose such restrictions on any shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement, as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions under applicable federal securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such shares are then listed and/or traded, under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such shares. It is expressly understood that the Committee is authorized to administer, construe, and make all determinations necessary or appropriate to the administration of the Plan and this Agreement, all of which shall be binding upon the Participant. (b) The Committee may terminate, amend, or modify the Plan and this Agreement under the terms of and as set forth in the Plan. (c) The Participant may elect, subject to any procedural rules adopted by the Committee, to satisfy any tax withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined, equal to the amount required to be withheld, subject to the restrictions imposed by 

12 applicable securities laws and Company policies regarding trading in its shares. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold from the Participant s compensation, or require him or her to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant s FICA or similar obligation), domestic or foreign, required by law to be withheld with respect to any payout to him or her under this Agreement. (d) The Participant agrees to take all steps necessary to comply with all applicable provisions of federal and state securities laws in exercising his or her rights under this Agreement. (e) This Agreement shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. (f) Except as provided in the third paragraph of this Agreement, this Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between the Participant and the Company regarding the RSUs granted hereunder. Except as provided in the third paragraph of this Agreement, this Agreement and the Plan supersede any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the RSUs granted hereunder. (g) All rights and obligations of the Company under the Plan and this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. (h) To the extent not preempted by the laws of the United States, the laws of the State of Delaware shall be the controlling law in all matters relating to this Agreement without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws. (i) The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Covenants and other provisions contained herein are reasonable and valid and do not impose limitations greater than those that are necessary to protect the business interests and Confidential Information of the Company. The Company and the Participant agree that the invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more of the Covenants, other provisions, or parts thereof of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof, all of which are inserted conditionally on their being valid in law, and in the event one or more Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof contained 

13 herein shall be invalid, this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid Covenants, provisions, or parts thereof had not been inserted. The Participant and the Company agree that the Covenants and other provisions contained in this Agreement are severable and divisible, that none of such Covenants or provisions depend on any other Covenant or provision for their enforceability, that each such Covenant and provision constitutes an enforceable obligation between the Company and the Participant, that each such Covenant and provision shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other Covenant or provision of this Agreement, and that the existence of any claim or cause of action by one party to this Agreement against another party to this Agreement, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by any party to this Agreement of any such Covenant or provision. (j) If any of the provisions contained in this Agreement relating to the Covenants or other provisions contained herein, or any part thereof, are determined to be unenforceable because of the length of any period of time, the size of any area, the scope of activities or similar term contained therein, then such period of time, area, scope of activities or similar term shall be considered to be adjusted to a period of time, area, scope of activities or similar term which would cure such invalidity, and such Covenant or provision in its reduced form shall then be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. (k) This Agreement is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and shall be construed accordingly. To the extent that any amount or benefit that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and that is not exempt under Section 409A, is otherwise payable or distributable to him or her on account of separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) while he or she is a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), such amount or benefit shall be settled or distributed on the later of time for payment described in Section 3 of this Agreement and that date which is six (6) months after such separation from service. (l) The parties agree that the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement constitute good and valuable consideration. [End of Page]

The Exercise Notice shall be completed by the Optionholder and delivered to the Company s Stock Plan Administrator, as designated by the Company from time to time. The Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as to all Exercised Shares. The Optionholder shall also be required to make adequate provision for all withholding taxes relating to the exercise of the Option as a condition to the exercise of the Option. This Option shall be deemed to be exercised only upon receipt by the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by the payment of such aggregate Exercise Price and arrangement for the adequate provision for the withholding taxes relating to the exercise. (c) Compliance. No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of this Option unless such issuance, exercise and the method of payment of consideration for such Shares complies with Applicable Law. This Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a share. Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered transferred to the Optionholder on the date the Option is exercised with respect to such Exercised Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be liable to the Optionholder for damages relating to any delays in issuing the certificates for the Exercised Shares to the Optionholder, any loss of the certificates, or any mistakes or errors in the issuance of the certificates or in the certificates themselves. 3. Method of Payment. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Optionholder: (a) cash or check; 

Notice of Stock Option Grant -5- 11/2023 CONFIDENTIAL (b) consideration received by the Company under a same day sale program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan; or (c) by delivery to the Company of other shares of Common Stock of the Company; provided, however, that if the Exercise Price of Shares acquired pursuant to this Option is paid by delivery to the Company of other Common Stock acquired, directly or indirectly from the Company, the Exercise Price shall be paid only by shares of the Common Stock of the Company that have been held by the Optionholder for more than six (6) months (or such longer or shorter period of time required to avoid a charge to earnings for financial accounting purposes). The Optionholder may, subject to procedures satisfactory to the Board, satisfy such delivery requirement by presenting proof of beneficial ownership of such Common Stock. 4. Period for Exercise.

Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of the Optionholder only by the Optionholder. The terms of the Plan and this Option Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Optionholder. 6. Lock-Up. By exercising the Option, the Optionholder agrees that the Company (or a representative of the underwriter(s)) may, in connection with an underwritten registration of the offering of any equity securities of the Company under the Securities Act require that the Optionholder not sell, dispose of, transfer, make any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale, any shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company held by the Optionholder, for a period of time specified by the underwriter(s) (not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days) following the effective date of the registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act. The Optionholder further agrees to execute and deliver such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by the Company and/or the underwriter(s) that are consistent with the foregoing or that are necessary to give further effect thereto. In order to enforce the foregoing covenant, the Company may impose stop transfer instructions with respect to Shares of Common Stock until the end of such period. The underwriters of the Company s stock are intended third party beneficiaries of this section and shall have the right, power and authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party hereto. 8.

Copyright 2024 Mueller Water Products, Inc. All Rights Reserved. #16933 / 8/24 INSIDER TRADING POLICY POLICY SUMMARY The purpose of this insider trading policy statement (this Policy is (i) to establish guidelines so that all employees, consultants, agents, directors and officers of Mueller Water Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company comply with all applicable laws prohibiting trading in the Company Securities (as defined below) by persons having knowledge of material non-public information concerning the Company Inside Information ), (ii) to ensure that the Company itself fulfills its responsibility to comply with those laws and (iii) to prohibit covered persons from engaging in speculative transactions in the Company Securities. While the definition of what constitutes Inside Information is necessarily dependent on the facts of each case, in general, Inside Information means material, nonpublic information. Information is material if a reasonable investor would consider it important in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold the Company Securities or would significantly affect the market price of the Company Securities. Examples of material information often include, but are not limited to: i. monthly, quarterly or annual financial results of the Company; ii. significant changes in the level of revenues, income or expenses; iii. changes to previously announced earnings guidance, or the decision to suspend earnings guidance; iv. negotiation, execution or termination of significant contracts; v. significant changes in exposure to loss; vi. significant changes in investment results; vii. stock splits or dividend information; viii. major financings; ix. liquidity problems and extraordinary borrowings; x. significant personnel changes; xi. significant acquisitions or dispositions of assets; xii. significant litigation; xiii. a significant cybersecurity incident; xiv. merger negotiations; and xv. significant developments involving proceedings with state or federal regulatory authorities. Information is nonpublic if it has not been previously disclosed or made available to the general public. The fact that information has been disclosed to a few members of the public does not make it public for insider trading purposes. To be public, the information must have been disseminated in a manner designed to reach investors generally, and the investors must be given the opportunity to absorb the 

Page 2 of 8 information. Even after public disclosure of information about the Company, you must wait until the close of business on the second trading day after the information was publicly disclosed before you can treat the information as public. Nonpublic information may include: i. information available to a select group of analysts, brokers or institutional investors; ii. undisclosed facts that are the subject of rumors, even if the rumors are widely circulated; and iii. information that has been entrusted to the Company on a confidential basis until a public announcement of the information has been made and enough time has elapsed for the market to respond to a public announcement of the information (normally two trading days). APPLICABILITY This Policy applies to all transactions in the Company's securities (collectively referred to in this Policy as the Company Securities ), including (i) common stock, options and any other securities that the Company may issue, such as preferred stock, notes, bonds and convertible securities, as well as to derivative securities relating to any of the Company Securities, whether or not issued by the Company and (ii) the securities of certain other companies, including common stock, options and other securities issued by those companies as well as derivative securities relating to any of those companies' securities, where the person trading used information obtained while working for the Company. This Policy applies to all employees, consultants, agents, directors and officers of the Company who trade in the Company Securities while in the possession of Inside Information or who provide Inside Information to others. No exceptions will be made to this Policy, even where the transaction may have been very small, or the trading party may have planned to make the transaction before learning of the Inside Information. Those who buy or sell the Company Securities while in the possession of Inside Information can be held personally liable for damages totaling up to three times the profits made. Insider trading may also expose the liable party to criminal penalties. It is also the policy of the Company that the Company will not engage in transactions in the Company Securities while aware of Inside Information relating to the Company or the Company Securities. POLICY STATEMENT GENERAL POLICY Insiders Federal and state securities laws prohibit certain persons, deemed to be Insiders, from trading in a company's securities when those persons are in possession of Inside Information. Insiders are persons who possess or have access to Inside Information. Insiders also include the Company's directors, officers and ten percent or greater shareholders who are required to file reports with the SEC under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and certain other key employees designated by the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel or the Chief Compliance Officer who have access to the same types of information. Each employee and Insider is responsible for ensuring that he or she does not violate federal or state securities laws or this Policy. 

Page 3 of 8 To avoid inadvertent violations of the securities laws, or even the appearance of impropriety, as well as ensure Insiders comply with their reporting obligations, Insiders are required to pre-clear any transactions involving the Company Securities. Please see Procedure for Trading in the Company Securities by Insiders in Schedule I for specific information on the procedures Insiders must follow. Blackout Periods Because of access to Inside Information on a regular basis, all directors and officers of the Company, all of the Company s accounting, finance and investor relations personnel, all significant business line Controllers and other Company personnel as may be designated by the Company's General Counsel as Insiders, are hereby prohibited from trading the Company Securities (excluding exercising an option, but including selling the underlying stock) during certain time periods (the Blackout Periods each fiscal quarter. The Blackout Periods typically begin on the fifteenth day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and expire two trading days after the Company announces its quarterly earnings. The Company may impose additional Blackout Periods as it deems necessary. When a Blackout Period is not in effect, Insiders still must confer with the Company's General Counsel or his designees before purchasing, selling or exercising an option to acquire any securities of the Company. If any Insider comes into possession of Inside Information outside of a Blackout Period, such Insider nevertheless may not buy or sell the Company Securities from the time they obtain the Inside Information until two trading days after the public disclosure of such Inside Information by the Company. NOTE: Any employee who has access to potentially Inside Information on a regular basis must abide by the same restrictions applicable to Insiders as described in this paragraph. Any Company employee may, from time to time, come into possession of Inside Information. Such temporary Insiders may not buy or sell the Company Securities from the time they obtain the Inside Information until two trading days after the public disclosure of such Inside Information by the Company. Any employees who have concerns about whether they are in possession of information which falls within the definition of Inside Information should contact the Company's General Counsel before buying or selling the Company Securities (including exercising an option or selling the underlying stock). This will ensure that employees unaware of a particular piece of information do not give the appearance of improperly trading in the Company Securities and will minimize the risk of civil and criminal liability under federal and state securities laws. Tipping Information to Others, Including Family Members Company employees, consultants, agents, directors and officers must not reveal Inside Information to any unauthorized third party (including relatives, friends or business associates) for any reason, or to any third party for the purpose of assisting such third party's trading activities, or make buy or sell recommendations to a third party based upon such Inside Information. Insiders who reveal Inside Information to a third party may be liable as tippers and may face civil or criminal penalties. This Policy also applies to Insiders' spouses, minor children and adult family members residing with them, other family members who are financially dependent on them and any entities or accounts that any of them control (the term control being defined as the ability to direct the investment activities of such entities or accounts). Consequently, Insiders are responsible for the transactions of these persons, entities or accounts and should make these persons aware of the need to confer with the Insider before they engage in any transaction in the Company Securities. 

Page 4 of 8 Internet / Social Media Postings Posting material, nonpublic information, or responding to or making statements or recommendations based on this information, on any Internet website, electronic bulletin board, Internet message board, Internet chat room, social media website or other similar form of electronic communication can also constitute tipping under the securities laws. Employees and Insiders must notify the Company's General Counsel if they are aware of such activities by any employee or Insider. Conveyance, Disclosure or Dissemination of Information Inside Information must not be disclosed to any other Company employee unless that employee has a need to know the information in order to perform his or her job. When Inside Information is provided to a Company employee because it is essential to the performance of his or her job, he or she should be informed that it is Inside Information and that he or she is restricted from trading in the Company Securities until two trading days after the public disclosure of such information by the Company. If Company management becomes aware that Inside Information has been leaked widely within the Company, then the Company may prohibit all trading by employees in the Company Securities for so long as it deems necessary. Any employee who has received Inside Information must not disclose such information to anyone outside of the Company. Employees should not discuss Inside Information in the presence of members of the public. As a precaution, employees should refrain from discussion of Inside Information in any public area, such as elevators, hallways, etc. In order to avoid selective disclosure of Inside Information to parties outside of the Company, employees should refer any requests for financial information or financial projections or forecasts to the Company's Chief Financial Officer. This includes requests by analysts or others to corroborate their financial projections for the Company. Other inquiries from the investing community or the press should be referred to the Sr. Director of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. OTHER SECURITIES MATTERS Officers, directors, and holders of ten percent or more of the Company's common stock will be liable for short-swing profits from purchases and sales of such securities under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, excluding exercising an option, but including selling the underlying stock. Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act provides that any such person who makes both a purchase and sale or a sale and purchase of a company's securities within a period of six months must pay to the company the excess of the sale price over the purchase price even if no real profit was made. PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS The Company considers it inappropriate for any employee, director or officer to enter into speculative transactions in the Company Securities. Therefore, this Policy prohibits the short sale, purchase or sale of puts, calls, options or other derivative securities based on the Company Securities by employees, directors and officers. This prohibition also includes hedging or monetization transactions, such as forward sale contracts, in which the stockholder continues to directly or indirectly own the underlying security without all the risks or rewards of ownership. Employees, directors and officers may not purchase the Company Securities on margin, borrow against any account in which the Company Securities are held or pledge the Company Securities as collateral. This Policy does not prohibit the cashless exercise of stock options granted as part of a Company incentive plan. 

Page 5 of 8 NO EXCEPTIONS The Company DOES NOT allow exceptions to this Policy. Transactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons, such as the need to raise money for an emergency expenditure or to satisfy margin calls, are no exception to this Policy. QUESTIONS Questions regarding this Policy should be directed to the Legal Department or one of the individuals below: Chason Carroll Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary 770.206.4238 ccarroll@muellerwp.com CONSEQUENCES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE The consequences of insider trading violations can be staggering. For an individual who trades on Inside Information (or tips information to others), the consequences can include severe civil and criminal monetary penalties and extended jail terms. The Company and potentially any control supervisory person may also be subject to severe civil and criminal monetary penalties if they fail to take appropriate steps to prevent illegal trading. Moreover, if one of the Company's employees or Insiders violates this Policy, the Company may take disciplinary action or impose sanctions, including dismissal for cause. Needless to say, any of the above consequences, or even an SEC investigation that does not result in prosecution, can tarnish one's reputation and irreparably damage a career. Effective Date: August 2024 Policy Owner: Chason Carroll, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary This Policy replaces and supersedes the previously issued Insider Trading Policy effective June 2020. 

Copyright 2024 Mueller Water Products, Inc. All Rights Reserved. #16933 / 8/24 SCHEDULE I Procedure for Trading in the Company Securities by Insiders To provide assistance in preventing inadvertent insider trading violations and avoiding even the appearance of an improper transaction, all Insiders must comply with the following procedures for trading in the Company Securities: 1. General Prohibition: An Insider of the Company may never trade the Company Securities while in possession of Inside Information relating to the Company, even if the trading window described in Section 2 below is open. 2. Pre-clearance of Trades and Certain Gifts: All proposed transactions in the Company Securities, including any trading program or plan, must be reported to and pre-cleared by the Company's General Counsel or his designees in advance of the transaction, by sending the General Counsel a completed request available as an electronic Trade Request Form on the Company's Compliance site. Any pre-clearance approval provided by the General Counsel or his designees will only be effective through the close of business on the second trading day following such approval. After that time, if the trade does not occur, you must again contact the General Counsel or his designees for pre-approval of the trade. Before requesting pre-clearance for any transaction involving the Company Securities, the Insider must affirmatively represent the absence of Inside Information. Bona fide gifts by Insiders (other than Section 16 filers) are not subject to this Policy, unless the Insider making the gift has reason to believe that the recipient intends to sell the Company Securities while the Insider is aware of material non-public information, or the Insider has reason to believe that the recipient intends to sell the Company Securities during a Blackout Period. Additionally, Insiders who are Section 16 filers must seek pre-clearance for gifts to avoid potential issues with beneficial ownership reporting. 3. Pre-Approved Trading Plans: These restrictions and pre-clearance requirements do not apply to transactions under a pre-arranged contract or plan that complies with SEC Rule 10b5-1 and has been approved by the Company's General Counsel (a Pre-Approved Trading Plan ). A Pre-Approved Trading Plan must meet the following requirements: i. it has been reviewed and approved by the General Counsel at least five days in advance of being entered into (or, if revised or amended, such proposed revisions or amendments have been reviewed and approved by the General Counsel at least five days in advance of being entered into); ii. it provides that no trades may occur thereunder until expiration of the applicable cooling- off period specified in SEC Rule 10b5-1(c)(ii)(B), and no trades occur until after that time. The appropriate cooling-off period will vary based on the status of the Insider. For directors and officers, the cooling-off period ends on the later of (x) ninety days after adoption or certain modifications of the Pre-Approved Trading Plan; or (y) two business days following disclosure of the Company's financial results in a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K for the quarter in which the Pre-Approved Trading Plan was adopted. For all other Insiders, the cooling-off period ends thirty days after adoption or modification of the Pre-Approved Trading Plan. 

Page 7 of 8 This required cooling-off period will apply to the entry into a new Pre-Approved Trading Plan and any revision or modification of a Pre-Approved Trading Plan; iii. it is entered into in good faith by the Insider, and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of SEC Rule 10b5-1, at a time when the Insider is not in possession of Inside Information; and, if the Insider is a director or officer, the Pre-Approved Trading Plan must include representations by the Insider certifying to that effect; iv. it gives a third party the discretionary authority to execute such purchases and sales, outside the control of the Insider, so long as such third party does not possess any Inside Information; or explicitly specifies the security or securities to be purchased or sold, the number of shares, the prices and/or dates of transactions, or other formula(s) describing such transactions; and v. it is the only outstanding Pre-Approved Trading Plan entered into by the Insider (subject to the exceptions set out in SEC Rule 10b5-1(c)(ii)(D)). No Pre-Approved Trading Plan may be adopted during a Blackout Period. If you are considering entering into, modifying or terminating a Pre-Approved Trading Plan or have any questions regarding Pre-Approved Trading Plans, please contact the General Counsel. Insiders should consult their own legal and tax advisors before entering into, or modifying or terminating, a Pre-Approved Trading Plan. A trading plan, contract, instruction or arrangement will not qualify as a Pre-Approved Trading Plan without the prior review and approval of the General Counsel as described above. 4. Trading Windows: Insiders may, with pre-clearance, trade during the period beginning after the completion of two full trading days after the public release of the Company's annual or quarterly results. For example, if the public release of earnings results occurs on a Tuesday before the market opens, the first day an Insider could trade would be on the following Thursday. If earnings are released after the market opens on Tuesday, the first day an Insider could trade would be on the following Friday. The trading window period ends on the fifteenth day (or the last business day prior to the fifteenth if the fifteenth day is not a business day) of the last month of each quarter of the Company's fiscal year (specifically, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year), unless a Blackout Period is announced sooner. Please note that Insiders are required to obtain pre-clearance from the Company's General Counsel for all transactions occurring during a window period. Furthermore, if you receive clearance for a trade the day before the trading window ends, you must complete the trade before the window close, notwithstanding the statement above that trades must occur within two business days of receipt of pre-clearance. In addition, the Company may close a trading window at any time it deems necessary, in which event the Company will provide all Insiders with notification that the trading window has closed until further notice is provided. Insiders may only trade in the Company Securities during a trading window. If an Insider has a need to conduct a transaction in the Company Securities outside of a trading window, a special request must be made to the Company's General Counsel for approval of the transaction. This is true even if the Insider does not possess specific Inside Information. Depending upon circumstances at the time a request is made, and upon the position within the Company of the Insider making the request, approval may or may not be given for the trade. 5. Public Announcements During Trading Window: In addition, if at any time during a trading window, the Company makes a public announcement of material information, an Insider must not engage in any transactions until the second trading day after the information has been released in order to 

Page 8 of 8 give the Company's shareholders and the investing public the time to receive and absorb the information and act upon it. 6. SEC Filings: As discussed above, in advance of any transaction in the Company Securities (acquisitions, dispositions, transfers, gifts, etc.), all Insiders are required to report such transactions to and obtain pre-clearance from the Company's General Counsel. If you are required to file a Form 4, Form 144 or other documents with the SEC in connection with the transaction, at your request, the Company will assist you in completing any necessary SEC reporting forms. Remember, however, the ultimate responsibility for the filing of these forms rests with the Insider.
