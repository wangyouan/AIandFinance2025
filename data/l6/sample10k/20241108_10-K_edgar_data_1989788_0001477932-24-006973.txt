MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 5 | Page Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. The following accounting policies are deemed critical as they involve significant judgment and could materially affect the financial statements: Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers,' and applies ASC 340, 'Other Assets and Deferred Costs,' for the recognition and measurement of contract costs. In the Notes to the Audited Financial Statements, specifically on page F-7, the Company provides detailed disclosures regarding its revenue recognition policy. RESULTS OF OPERATION As of July 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 23,733. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. Year Ended July 31, 2024 compared to the period from Inception (March 7, 2023) to July 31, 2023 Revenue During the year ended July 31, 2024, the Company had 82,500 in revenue compared to 0 during the period from inception (March 7, 2023) to July 31, 2023. This growth was primarily driven by the launch of our products and services. Operating Expenses During the year ended July 31, 2024, we incurred total operating expenses of 105,472 compared to 761 during the period from inception (March 7, 2023) to July 31, 2023. General and administrative and professional fee expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting and developmental costs. Net Loss Our net loss for the year ended July 31, 2024 was 22,972 compared to 761 during the period from inception (March 7, 2023) to July 31, 2023. 6 | Page Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As at July 31, 2024 our total assets were 68,190 compared to 4,064 in total assets at July 31, 2023. As at July 31, 2024, our total liabilities were 25,803 compared to 825 as of July 31, 2023. Stockholders equity was 42,387 as of July 31, 2024 compared to 3,239 as of July 31, 2023. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended July 31, 2024, net cash from operating activities was 2,359, consisting of net loss of 22,972, amortization expenses of 831, increase in accounts payable of 10,000 and increase in prepaid sales of 14,500. For the period from inception (March 7, 2023) to July 31, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 761, consisting entirely of net loss. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the year ended July 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 45,978. For the period from inception (March 7, 2023) to July 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 0. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended July 31, 2024 were 62,598, consisting of 478 loan from related party and 62,120 proceeds from issuance of common stock. Cash flows provided by financing activities during the period from inception (March 7, 2023) to July 31, 2023 were 4,825, consisting of 825 loan from related party and 4,000 proceeds from issuance of common stock. 7 | Page Table of Contents PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. MATERIAL COMMITMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Guru App Factory Corp. the Company as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholder s equity, and cash flows, for the year ended July 31, 2024 and for the period from March 7, 2023 (inception) through July 31,2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2024 and for the period from March 7, 2023 (inception) to July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit and net losses. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters. PCAOB ID #0 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2023 November 5, 2024 F-1 Table of Contents GURU APP FACTORY CORP.

F-5 Table of Contents GURU APP FACTORY CORP. NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2024 . These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. shares of common stock authorized with a par value of per share.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of July 31, 2024, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission of 2013 (COSO).
