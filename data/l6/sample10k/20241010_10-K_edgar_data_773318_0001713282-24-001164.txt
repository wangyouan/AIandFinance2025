Company
History 

As
a Cardholder Independent Sales Organization, Veritec is able to promote and sell Visa-branded card programs. As a Third-Party Servicer,
Veritec provides back-end cardholder transaction processing services for Visa-branded card programs on behalf of its sponsoring bank.
Veritec has a portfolio of five United States and eight foreign patents. In addition, we have seven U.S. and twenty-eight foreign
pending patent applications. Veritec has had agreements with various banks in the past and is currently seeking a bank to sponsor its
Prepaid Card programs. 

Our
Products and Solutions 

The
Company believes that its Mobile Banking Technology platform and its blinx On-Off debit card and blinxPay mobile wallet
programs are a significant advance in mobile banking and close loop/open loop debit technology and is capable of bringing significant
value to card issuing and sponsoring organizations, whether they be commercial or government. 

(a) MTC 
Debit Card - Visa Prepaid Card Programs 

In
fiscal year 2009, the Company announced the release of its Mobile Toggle Card (MTC Program on the Company s mobile banking
software platform under a sponsoring bank. Veritec s mobile banking software platform is a debit based, pre-paid and gift card
solution that is licensed by Veritec s wholly owned subsidiary, Veritec Financial Systems, Inc., to debit card issuers and sponsoring
organizations. Under the MTC Program, card issuers and sponsors may provide the MTC branded debit or gift cards to individuals
with and without demand deposit accounts (e.g., the latter the under-banked ). The MTC card may be part of a Visa 
branded program and, as such, the cards are accepted anywhere in the world that Visa cards are accepted. 

1 

With
an MTC card, the cardholders are empowered to combat unpermitted and fraudulent use of their debit cards by toggling 
their cards on and off with their mobile phones. Cardholders no longer have to completely rely on their card
issuers to monitor possible fraudulent activity on their accounts. Cardholders can now de-activate their cards themselves, in real-time,
any time they choose to do so. In addition to this toggling feature, cardholders may apply for their cards online, arrange for direct
deposits to be made to their cards, and transfer money to their card from another account. Cardholders may also elect to receive various
alerts on their mobile phones about activity on their card. In the fiscal year 2010, the Company began accepting applications for the
MTC card from individual applicants and issuing live Visa branded debit cards under the MTC Mobile Toggle Card Program. 

(b) blinx
ON-OFF Debit Card - Visa Prepaid Card Programs 

In fiscal year 2011, Veritec began marketing the blinx ON-OFF 
branded card under a bank sponsorship. The blinx ON-OFF card is based on the Mobile Banking Technology platform and offers the
same features and functions as the MTC branded card but with different pricing for bank-sponsored cards. 

(c) Custom
Branded Debit Card Programs 

In
addition to the MTC and blinx ON-OFF branded program, the Company enables card issuers and sponsors to issue debit, pre-paid
and gift cards under their own branded programs through licensed use of the mobile banking platform and the Company s provision
of related professional services. 

(d) blinxPay 
Mobile Wallet App 

The
Company released its blinxPay mobile wallet application during fiscal year 2016. blinxPay is a secure payment processing
system and mobile app that enables customers to make purchases at participating merchants using funds loaded into their blinxPay 
virtual account. The blinxPay mobile app is available for download for free at both Google Play and Apple App Store. 

Veritec s
mobile banking solution also enables member card programs to be processed and settled member rewards to its members in either an open
or closed loop processing environment. In addition to its front-end licensing and professional services, the Company also provides back-end
card processing services to the card issuing institutions for all cardholder transactions on the licensed platform. The Company s
Mobile Banking Technology resides within a Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant data processing center. 

Intellectual
Property Rights 

The
Company was founded upon its intellectual property on its belief that its intellectual property will give the Company a commercial advantage
in the global marketplace. The Company relies on patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law, as well as the company s contractual
terms with its customers, to define, maintain and enforce the Company s intellectual property rights in its Mobile Banking Technology
and other technologies and relationships. 

The
Company has a portfolio of seven United States and eight foreign patents. In addition, we have three U.S. and eight foreign
pending patent applications. 

A
significant amount of the Company s intellectual property takes the form of trade secrets and copyrighted works of authorship.
The Company treats the source code to its Mobile Banking Technology as trade secrets, and its licensed software applications are copyrightable
subject matter. 

We
have a portfolio of registered and pending trademarks in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including registrations for the marks
 VSCode and VeriCode . The Company uses Veritec as a trademark and service mark, as
well as serving as the Company s trade name.

Major
Customers 

During
the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company had one customer (a related party) that represented 37 of our revenues, one customer
that represented 33 of our revenues and one customer that represented 22 of our revenues. No other customer represented more than
10 of our revenues. 

During
the year ended June 30, 2023, we had three customers that represented 61 (a related party), 14 and 13 of our revenues, respectively.
No other customer represented more than 10 of our revenues. 

Competition 

Our
Mobile Banking Technology competes with other independent sales organizations and third party services of Visa-branded card programs,
including TransCash Corporation, Ready Debit Card by MetaBank, Millenium Advantage Card by New Millenium Bank, and Wired Plastic by Bancorp
Bank. The Company believes, however, that there are very few companies that have the Company s collective attributes of (1) being
an independent sales organization of Visa-branded and non-branded prepaid card programs, (2) being a third party servicer (e.g., back
end processor) for banks issuing Visa-branded and non-branded prepaid card programs, (3) being the developer, marketer and licensor of
the mobile banking platform on which Visa-branded and non-branded card program cardholder transactions take place, and (4) having a mobile
banking platform that enables real-time transaction processing and enabling cardholders to manage their accounts by enabling cardholders
to toggle their cards and their website accounts on and off via their mobile phones. 

Employees 

As
of June 30, 2024, the Company employed seven employees and six independent contractor consultants.

the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, United States customers accounted for 100 of the Company s total revenue.

Risk
management and strategy 

We
recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information
systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. 

Managing
Material Risks Integrated Overall Risk Management 

We
have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture
of cybersecurity risk management. This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making
processes at every level. Our management team works closely with our IT department to continuously evaluate and address cybersecurity
risks in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs. 
 
 3 

Oversee
Third-party Risk 

Because
we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we have implemented stringent processes to oversee and manage
these risks. We conduct thorough security assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing monitoring
to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards. The monitoring includes annual assessments of the SOC reports (or international
equivalent) of our providers and implementing complementary controls. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related to data breaches
or other security incidents originating from third parties. 

Risks
from Cybersecurity Threats 

We
have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing. 

ITEM
2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY 

We
lease approximately 4,200 square feet of office and laboratory space at 2445 Winnetka Avenue North, Golden Valley, Minnesota, which serves
as our primary place of business. This lease is with Van Thuy Tran, the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company. Our lease is currently on a month-to-month term and requires monthly payments of 4,000.

3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION 

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results could differ materially
from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report. 

The
following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based on the preparation of
our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis
together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto. 

6 

Inflation 

Global
inflation increased during 2021, 2022 and in 2023. The Russia Ukraine conflict and other geopolitical conflicts, as well as related international
response, have exacerbated inflationary pressures, including causing increases in the price for goods and services and global supply
chain disruptions, which have resulted and may continue to result in shortages in food products, materials and services. Such shortages
have resulted and may continue to result in inflationary cost increases for labor, fuel, food products, materials and services, and could
continue to cause costs to increase as well as result in the scarcity of certain materials. We cannot predict any future trends in the
rate of inflation or other negative economic factors or associated increases in our operating costs and how that may impact our business.
To the extent we are unable to recover higher operating costs resulting from inflation or otherwise mitigate the impact of such costs
on our and their business, our revenues and operating results could decrease, and our financial condition and results of operations could
be adversely affected. 

Recent
Events 

 On
July 4, 2022, we entered a Memorandum of Understanding (the MOU for the purpose of forming a strategic partnership between
the Company and Nugen Universe, LLC Nugen ), a corporation located in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. Nugen seeks us
to modify, create, or build a private label system for Nugen, with an initial interest in our blinxPay technology and Bio-ID
verification system. Nugen paid us 50,000 at the date of the MOU signing and during the period ended December 31, 2022, we completed
our performance obligations, and recorded the 50,000 payment as Mobile banking technology revenue during the period then ended. Nugen
further agreed to pay the us a 5 ongoing royalty for licensing the Company s blinxPay technology and Bio-ID verification system.
As of June 30, 2024, no royalties have been realized under the MOU. 

 On
October 10, 2022, the Company entered into a License and Distributor Agreement License Agreement with Nugen. The License
Agreement became effective on receipt of 200,000 in December 31, 2022 and extends through August 31, 2027. The License Agreement grants
Nugen a Worldwide license and distribution for the Company s blinxPay Close-Loop Virtual Wallet and blinxPay Open-Loop Visa Debit
and all hardware products of the Company. Per the terms of the License Agreement, Nugen agrees to pay the Company a one-time license
payment of 1,000,000 for the right to market the Company s products noted above, of which 200,000 was received by the Company
in December 2022. The initial 200,000 has been recorded as deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred revenue
balance of 200,000 at June 30, 2023, will begin being amortized to Mobile banking technology revenue starting once the Company has met
its performance obligations under the License Agreement through the remaining term of the License Agreement, which expires on August
31, 2027. The remaining balance of 800,000 is scheduled to be paid as follows: 100,000 when the Company s identifies a domestic
sponsor bank, 350,000 to integrate the Company s blinxPay software platform, and interface blinxPay with a sponsor foreign bank,
and 350,000 on the completion of the final stage of testing, installation, and launch. In addition to the one-time license payment,
Nugen agrees to pay a minimum monthly support fee plus 5 royalty from all sales of products noted above. As of June 30, 2024, no royalty
related revenues have been realized under the License Agreement. 

 On
May 1, 2024, the Company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Encore Sales and Marketing LLC Encore under which the Company granted Encore exclusive rights to sell and market the Company s products to the gaming industry (as defined
in the agreement) and on a non-exclusive basis to all other industries through April 2029. In return, the Company received a payment
of 150,000 and will receive an additional 50,000 within the first 120 days of the agreement. The Company will also receive a minimum

Mobile Banking Technology revenues for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were 139,000 and 140,000, respectively. 

Other revenue, management fee - related party 

On
December 31, 2015, the Company sold all of its assets of its Barcode Technology, which was comprised solely of its intellectual property,
to The Matthews Group, a related party. The Company subsequently entered into a management services agreement with The Matthews Group
to manage all facets of the barcode technology operations through June 30, 2024. The Company earns a fee of 35 of all revenues billed
up to June 30, 2024, and recognizes management fee revenue as services are performed. For the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue
earned from the management services agreement was 172,000 and 216,000, respectively. 

License fees 

On
May 1, 2024, the Company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Encore Sales and Marketing LLC Encore under which the Company granted Encore exclusive rights to sell and market the Company s products to the gaming industry (as defined
in the agreement) and on a non-exclusive basis to all other industries through April 2029. In return, the Company received a payment
of 150,000 and will receive an additional 50,000 within the first 120 days of the agreement. The Company will also receive a minimum
payment of 60,000 per month in the first year of the agreement, commencing after 120 days, 120,000 per month in the second year and
 180,000 per month in the third year. All subsequent years will have a minimum of 10 per year growth. As of June 30, 2024, the Company
only received the 150,000 payment. The Company recorded the payment of 150,000 as revenue during the year ended June 30, 2024, as all
performance obligations under the agreement had been met as of that date.

Cost
of Revenue 

Cost
of revenue for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 173,000 and 211,000, respectively. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 796,000 and 883,000, respectively. The decrease
in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased payroll, commissions and software R D as compared
to the same period of the prior year. 

Other
Expense 

Interest
expense for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was 550,000 and 496,000, respectively. The increase was due to the increase in our
notes payable balance. 

Net
Loss 

We
had a net loss of 1,058,000 for the year ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 1,234,000 for the year ended June 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
cash balance on June 30, 2024 increased to 118,000 as compared to 61,000 on June 30, 2023. The increase was the result of the net 553,000
net cash provided by financing activities, offset by 496,000 cash used in operating activities. Net cash used in operations during the
year ended June 30, 2024, was 496,000, compared with 499,000 of net cash used in operations during the same period of the prior year.
Cash used in operations during the period ended June 30, 2024 was primarily from our net loss of 1,058,000, offset by increased interest
accrued on convertible notes and notes payable of 551,000. Net cash provided by financing activities of 553,000 was from proceeds received
from notes payable - related party during the period ended June 30, 2024 of 586,000, offset by repayments of 33,000. During the same
period of the prior year, net cash provided by financing activities of 494,000 was from proceeds received from notes payable 
related party. 

 The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the period ended June 30, 2024, the
Company incurred a net loss of 1,058,000 and used cash in operating activities of 496,000, and on June 30, 2024, the Company had a
stockholders deficit of 9,728,000. In addition, as of June 30, 2024, the Company is delinquent in payment of 794,000 of its
notes payable. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year
of the date that the financial statements are issued. 

The
Company believes its cash and forecasted cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to continue operations through fiscal 2025
without continued external investment. The Company believes it will require additional funds to continue its operations through fiscal
2025 and to continue to develop its existing projects and plans to raise such funds by finding additional investors to purchase the Company s
securities, generating sufficient sales revenue, implementing dramatic cost reductions or any combination thereof. There is no assurance
that the Company can be successful in raising such funds, generating the necessary sales or reducing major costs. Further, if the Company
is successful in raising such funds from sales of equity securities, the terms of these sales may cause significant dilution to existing
holders of common stock. 

 The
Company has traditionally been dependent on The Matthews Group, LLC, a related party, for its financial support. The Matthews Group is
owned 50 by Ms Tran, and 50 by Lawrence J. Johanns, a significant Company stockholder.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to
accrued liabilities, certain expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. 

Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Veritec, Inc. (the Company and subsidiaries as of June 30,
2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries as of June
30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended , in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has had recurring losses from operations and had a
stockholders deficiency as of June 30, 2024. In addition, convertible notes and notes payable in the amount of 794,000 are
in default or past due. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 F-1 

Revenue
recognition Revenue from Related Party 

As
described in Notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into a management services agreement (the
 Agreement with The Matthews Group (TMG), to manage all facets of their barcode technology operations through June 30,
2024. TMG is owned 50 by Ms. Tran, the Company s CEO/Executive Chair and a director, and 50 by Larry Johanns, a significant stockholder
of the Company. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company earns a fee of 35 of all revenues billed by TMG to its customers. The Company
recognizes management fee revenue as services are performed by TMG. In addition, all net cash flow from the barcode technology
operations is retained by the Company and reflected as proceeds from notes payable to TMG. Management fee revenue from the Agreement
represented approximately 37 of the Company s total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 

We
identified the Company s recording of revenue as a critical audit matter because of the complexity involved in the recognition
of such revenue, in particular given its related party nature. In turn, the auditing of revenue from related party required a high degree
of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures to ensure
revenue has been properly recorded. 

The
primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 

We
 obtained and evaluated documentation prepared by management which outlines the Company s revenue recognition policies and their
 processes to determine the revenue to be recognized from TMG sales pursuant to the underlying agreements and current accounting guidelines. 

We
 evaluated whether the Company s conclusion in such documentation was consistent with relevant accounting standards. 

We
 obtained a schedule of all revenue recognized by TMG and reconciled the recorded revenue to the underlying accounting records. 

We
 selected a sample of revenue transactions recorded by TMG and performed detail testing including the following for each selection: 

Obtained evidence of a contract with the customer; 

Compared the amounts recognized and timing of revenue recognition to underlying source documents such as invoices, form of payments,
and executed contracts and related modifications, if any; 

Evaluated the Company s application of their accounting policies to determine the timing and amount recognized; and 

For each sample tested, we recalculated the Company s share of revenue based upon the terms of the agreement and reconciled to
the Company s accounting records. 

We
 obtained and tested a schedule of net receipts retained by the Company and reflected as a note payable to TMG. 

We
 confirmed the balance of the note to TMG as of June 30, 2024. 

We
 read and evaluated management s disclosure of the nature of the transaction and identification as related party transaction.

Veritec
has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately as of June 30, 2024 for federal purposes available to offset future
taxable income that expires in varying amounts through 2044. The ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards could be limited

in ownership). The Company is subject to examination by tax authorities for all years for which a loss carryforward is utilized in subsequent
periods. 

The
Company follows FASB guidelines that address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return
should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the
largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This guidance also provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest, and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
disclosures. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and no adjustment was
required at adoption. 

The
Company s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax provisions as income tax expense. As of June 30, 2024 and
2023, the Company has accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures 

Based
upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures performed by our Chief Executive Officer as of the
end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have not
been effective as a result of a weakness in the design of internal control over financial reporting identified below. 

As
used herein, disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of our company that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Accounting Officer conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on management s evaluation under
the framework, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2024. 

The
Company did not maintain an effective control environment, which is the foundation necessary for effective internal control over financial
reporting. Specifically, the Company (i) did not maintain a functioning independent audit committee; (ii) did not have its Board of Directors
review and approve significant transactions; (iii) had an insufficient number of personnel appropriately qualified to perform control
design, execution and monitoring activities; (iv) had an insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge
and experience and ongoing training in the application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements commensurate with the Company s
financial reporting requirements; (v) had inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (vi) lack of written
documentation of the Company s key internal control policies and procedures over financial reporting. The Company is required under
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to have written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting. The Company did
not formally document policies and controls to enable management and other personnel to understand and carry out their internal control
responsibilities including the lack of closing checklists, budget-to-actual analyses, balance sheet variation analysis, and pro-forma
financial statements. Additionally, the Company did not have an adequate process in place to complete its testing and assessment of the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended June 30, 2024, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
