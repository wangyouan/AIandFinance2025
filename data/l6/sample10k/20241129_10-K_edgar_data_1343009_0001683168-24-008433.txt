PART I 

Item 1. Description of Business 

CNBX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. is based in Bethesda,
Maryland, is a clinical stage company dedicated to discovery, development and commercialization of novel cannabinoid-based products and
innovative technologies for the treatment of cancer. Our first lead product candidate is a Cannabics SR, the oral capsule developed for
the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and cancer anorexia cachexia syndrome (CACS). Our leading anti-neoplastic drug candidate
under development for Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is RCC-33. 

Historically we were previously an exploration
stage mining company which transitioned into a bio-tech company in 2014. 

Our corporate address is #3 Bethesda Metro Center,
Suite 700, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814; Telephone (877) 424-2429. 

The Company was previously engaged in the oil
and gas exploration business. On April 29th, 2014, the Company began a new direction and the majority of the Shareholders of the Company
elected the Board of Directors and renamed the Company Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. The Company s R D is conducted in a Government
licensed lab facility in Israel with the focus of development of cannabinoid-based therapies, medications and administration routes for
treatment of cancer. 

History: 

Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. was incorporated
on September 15, 2004, under the laws of the State of Nevada, as Thrust Energy Corp., for the purpose of acquiring undivided working interests
in small oil and gas exploration properties and non-operating interests in both producing and exploration projects throughout the United
States and Canada. 

On September 30, 2010, we increased our authorized
capital to 900 million shares of common stock (par value 0.0001) and 100 million shares of preferred stock (par value 0.0001) and effected
a 20-for-1 reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse split, our issued and outstanding common
stock was reduced from 13,604,000 shares to 680,202 shares and 5,000,000 preferred shares. 

Due to our inability to earn any meaningful revenue
from oil and gas exploration, our management determined in April 2011 that we should change our business plan to include toll milling
and refining. 

On May 5, 2011, we effected a change of name to American Mining Corp.
by completing a short form merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary. 

On April 25, 2014, Cannabics Inc., a Delaware
Corporation, purchased 20,500,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company, thus acquiring control of the Company. 

On June 3, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors
declared a two-to-one forward stock split of all outstanding shares of common stock. The stock split was approved by FINRA on June 19th,
2014. The effect of the stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from 40,880,203 to 81,760,406. All common
share and per common share data in these financial statements and related notes hereto have been retroactively adjusted to account for
the effect of the stock split for all periods presented prior to June 3rd, 2014. The total number of authorized common shares and the
par value thereof was not changed by the split. 

1 

On June 19, 2014, FINRA granted final approval
of Change of Name Ticker Symbol of the Corporation from American Mining Corporation to Cannabics PHARMACEUTICALS INC., with the
new Ticker Symbol of CNBX . Said approval was predicated upon CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc. s filing of Articles of Merger
with American Mining Corporation with the Nevada Secretary of State on May 21st, 2014. Under the laws of the State of Nevada, CNBX Pharmaceuticals
Inc. was merged with and into the Registrant, with the Registrant being the surviving entity. The Merger was completed under Section 92A.180
of the Nevada Revised Statutes, Chapter 92A, as amended, and as such, does not require the approval of the stockholders of either the
Registrant or CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc. 

On July 24, 2014, the Company executed a Collaboration
Agreement with Cannabics Inc. Cannabics ), a Delaware corporation and largest shareholder of the Company. Per the terms
of the Agreement, the Company issued 18,239,594 shares of its common stock to acquire the entire institutional knowledge of Cannabics,
Inc., which primarily consists of in-process Research Development technology, the cumulative result of its years of scientific institutional
knowledge in the fields of Molecular Biology, Cancer and Pharmacology research. Additionally, Cannabics tendered 150,000 to the Company
specifically earmarked as working funds towards prospective projects of the Company. Per the Agreement, from that day forth they have
carried forward their research and development as part of, and for the exclusive benefit of the Company, which initial findings have now
branched out into new and divergent discoveries. 

On August 25, 2014, Cannabics Pharmaceuticals
Inc. incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in Israel, named G.R.I.N Ultra Ltd , dedicated to advanced research and development. 

On July 3, 2018, the Company announced the conclusion
of its Clinical Trial of Cannabics SR 5mg drug for Cancer Anorexia Cachexia Syndrome, as noted on the press release of that date. 

On June 16 th , 2020, the Company announced
its appointment of Dr. Erez Scapa, MD, to its Scientific Board of Advisors. Dr. Scapa is an Expert in Invasive Gastroenterology in the
Sourasky Medical Center in Tel-Aviv, Israel, where he is head of the Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) program. 

On August 5 th , 2020, the Company announced
its appointment of Dr. Dana Ben-Ami Shor to its Scientific Board of Advisors, where she will help lead the design and implementation of
the company's clinical validation plan of its novel drug candidates for the treatment of colorectal cancer. 

On August 20 th , 2020, the Company announced
the creation of a new Division for its Anti-Tumor drug candidate RCC-33, for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The emanates from the
Company s focus on a clinical validation path, including in-vivo experiments, collaborations with key medical centers, and
the preparation of a product dossier with which the company plans to schedule a Pre IND-Meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(the FDA ). 

On October 18 th , 2021, the Company
filed 2 new Provisional Patent applications on Compositions and Methods for treating cancer, including colorectal cancer and early intervention
therapy for colorectal cancer patients. 

On May 10, 2022, the Company changed its name
from Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the current CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc.; effectuated a one-for-one hundred twenty (1:120)
reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company and decreased its authorized shares of preferred stock
from 100,000,000 to 5,000,000 as noted in the 8K of May 13 th , 2022. 

On July 20 th , 2022, Dr. Eyal Ballan
resigned his position as Chief Technical Officer, and was replaced by Dr. Sanja Goldberg as noted in the 8K of July 24 th , 2022.
Sanja is no longer with the company but could be called back. 

On May 12, 2022, the Company effected a reverse-split of its common stock on a 1:120 basis.

Our Business: 

Company Overview 

We are a clinical-stage company specializing in
the discovery, development and commercialization of novel cannabinoid-based products and innovative technologies for the treatment of
cancer. 

Our first lead product candidate is Cannabics
SR the oral capsule developed for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and cancer anorexia cachexia syndrome (CACS), showed
promising results in a peer-reviewed clinical study that concluded the results justify a larger clinical study. For oncology, we intend
to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional oncology therapies, based on their mechanisms of action,
safety profiles and versatility. Our leading anti-neoplastic drug candidate under development for Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is RCC-33, a
first-in-class therapy being developed primarily in two settings: one to reduce tumor cell activity in CRC patients as a standalone in
neoadjuvant treatment or window of opportunity at the time after colonoscopy, prior to cancer staging; and another for patients
with refractory to therapy and adjuvant to surgery also at the time after colonoscopy. Neoadjuvant treatment is the administration of
antitumor therapy as a first step to shrink a cancerous tumor prior to surgical intervention. Upon fundraising we intend to initiate a
Phase I/II clinical trials for both candidates in 2026. 

1. General: 

CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a clinical stage
pharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of novel cannabinoid-based products and innovative technologies for the treatment
of cancer. 

Upon financing the company will prepare to launch
Phase I/II (a) clinical study in 2026, for the evaluation of its lead drug candidates Cannabics SR for the treatment of patients with
advanced cancer and cancer anorexia cachexia syndrome (CACS) and RCC-33 for the treatment of colorectal cancer. 

Our company s core activities consist of: 

Drug Discovery: development of novel molecular formulations and drug candidates; 

Intellectual Property: filing of corresponding IP to protect our products; and 

Regulatory Affairs: initiation of the regulatory pathway for each drug candidate in our development pipeline 

Our current business model is to undertake an
FDA regulatory pathway for each of the new drug candidates under IND (Investigational New Drug) classification and complete a successful
Phase I/II(a) clinical study (toxicity and proof of concept in humans). In reaching this milestone, where an initial feasibility in humans
was demonstrated, the company will have gained several commercial opportunities for capitalizing on each such product candidate, including
entering into commercial agreements with larger pharma corporations. Accordingly, our company does not engage in any manufacturing, distribution,
or sales of products, nor is it foreseeable to expect that we will in the near future.

2. Development pipeline: 

2.1. Cannabics SR for Cancer Anorexia-Cachexia Syndrome 

Overview 

We are developing Cannabics SR as a product
candidate for the treatment of CACS. Cannabics SR is a sustained-release oral capsule containing a standardized compound of cannabinoids
that has demonstrated a clinically significant weight increase in CACS patients in a peer-reviewed pilot study conducted by Dr. Gil Bar-Sela
of the Rambam Hospital Health Care Campus, Division of Oncology, in Haifa, Israel. Our patent-pending technology provides for a convenient,
once or twice daily administration, with rapid onset and a steady state of therapeutic effect for a 6 to 8-hour duration. 

Cancer Anorexia-Cachexia Syndrome 

CACS is a common complication of cancer associated
with high morbidity and mortality. It is a complex metabolic syndrome in which a persistently elevated basal metabolic rate is not compensated
for by adequate calorie or protein intake, causing involuntary and progressive weight loss leading to increasing functional impairment
in cancer patients, especially in advanced stages of the disease. Once established, CACS cannot presently be reversed using available
pharmacological or nutritional support techniques. 

Unlike starvation, body-weight loss in CACS patients
arises mainly from loss of muscle mass, characterized by increased catabolism of skeletal muscle and decreased protein synthesis. This
weight loss is associated with important clinical outcomes such as increased morbidity, diminished effectiveness of chemotherapy, muscle
wasting, inflammation, fatigue, and reduced survival expectations. The impact of CACS on the patient is not, however, limited to the effect
of weight loss. Quality of life, functional abilities, symptoms, psychological outcomes, and social aspects are all affected by CACS. 

According to the National Cancer Institute, nearly
one-third of cancer deaths can be attributed to the severe weight loss and metabolic mutiny associated with CACS, and more
than 50 of patients with cancer die with cachexia being present. The overall prevalence of CACS is currently estimated to range from
40 at cancer diagnosis to 70-80 in advanced phases of the disease Source: Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology, 2013;88(3):625-636 ),
while the overall prevalence of weight loss in cancer patients may be as high as 86 in the last 1-2 weeks of life Source: Journal
of Pain and Symptom Management 2007;34:94 104 ). 

The cause and subsequent development of CACS is
still poorly understood, but several factors and biological pathways are known to be involved, including inflammation, decreased secretion
of anabolic hormones, and altered metabolic response. While there have been important advances in the study of CACS over the past decade,
including progress in understanding its mechanisms and the development of promising pharmacologic and supportive care interventions, there
is presently no effective pharmacologic therapy for CACS. 

Current treatments for CACS are generally based
on nutritional support and CACS pathophysiology-modulating drugs, with the most common being the progestogens, megestrol and medroxyprogesterone,
and corticosteroids. Progestogens appear to stimulate appetite and improvements in body weight by increasing adipose tissue, but have
not been confirmed to augment lean body mass. Megestrol also carries an increased risk of mortality and thromboembolism. Nonetheless,
megestrol is the only FDA approved treatment option for CACS and no drug to date has been shown to be superior to it in efficacy and tolerability.
Corticosteroids are also considered effective in stimulating appetite and reducing fatigue but should only be used for short periods and
in selected cases because of side effects from longer term use, such as insulin resistance, fluid retention, steroidal myopathy, skin
fragility, adrenal insufficiency, and sleep and cognitive disorders. Other drugs are being investigated or are in development. Given the
dearth of approved therapies, we believe that CACS remains a significant area of unmet medical need. 

4 

Cannabinoid Therapies for CACS 

Cannabis has long been suggested as a well-tolerated,
safe, and effective option to help patients cope with cancer related symptoms with fewer serious side effects than most prescription drugs
currently used as anti-emetics, analgesics, and the like. As such, cannabinoids are finding application in palliative care for reducing
nausea and vomiting, alleviating cancer pain, and stimulating appetite, as well as improving quality of life in cancer patients. Dronabinol
(Marinol and nabilone (Cesamet ), two drugs based on synthetic cannabinoids, have each been approved by the FDA for the treatment
of chemotherapy-related nausea in patients who do not respond to conventional antiemetic therapy. Another drug, nabiximols (Sativex ),
a specific cannabis extract, is approved in Canada and the United Kingdom for symptomatic relief of pain in advanced cancer patients. 

Despite interest in cannabinoid-based therapies
as a treatment for CACS, their use has been limited by impediments beyond the legal status of cannabis. The most significant obstacle
is the lack of clinical research demonstrating their efficacy. While there is evidence that cannabinoids improve appetite, body weight,
body fat level, caloric intake, mood, and quality of life in cancer patients, the few studies on these effects have yielded mixed and
inconclusive findings. In addition, some of these studies have suffered from methodological constraints that limit any ability to draw
firm conclusions. 

The therapeutic use of cannabinoids has also been
inhibited by limitations associated with traditional administration routes that reduce their effectiveness. Smoking and ingestion of cannabis
suffer from wide variability in potency due to a lack of standardized and reproducible formulations. The ingestion of unformulated cannabis
has also been associated with poor absorption and low bioavailability versus other administration routes, requiring higher doses and a
greater risk of negative side effects. Additionally, the lack of available information on cannabinoid strains has made it difficult for
healthcare providers to establish dosing rates. In our experience, however, the principal concern of patients with respect to medical
cannabis lies in the undesirable side effects, such as disorientation and dizziness, which result from significant variability in peak
blood levels of active cannabinoids soon after administration. We further believe that these side effects, which are common among immediate
release methods, are a significant factor in the failure of patients to adhere to recommended treatment regimens and are therefore a pervasive
threat to their health and wellbeing. 

Cannabics SR 

Cannabics SR is an oral composition in the
form of a hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule containing a patent-pending formulation of cannabinoid extracts suspended in a lipid
emulsion. It provides a relatively rapid onset of action, typically within 30-40 minutes, followed by a gradual and sustained release
of active cannabinoids, resulting in a steady state level of beneficial effects for up to 6 to 8 hours with each capsule. Cannabics SR
provides a consistent, predictable concentration of cannabinoids with an absorption profile and bioavailability of active ingredients
that we believe to be superior to other oral cannabinoid administrations. We believe that the multifactorial benefits of the active pharmaceutical
ingredients in Cannabics SR address an unmet medical need for a safe and effective treatment of CACS, leading to improved patient
adherence and better health outcomes. 

Cannabics SR capsules contain only food grade
materials without any artificial additives. The active ingredients of each capsule are standardized in composition, formulation, and dose,
and are comprised of only pure, natural extracts of active cannabinoids from selected strains of medical cannabis. All excipients are
recognized by the FDA as Generally Regarded as Safe. 

In addition to the therapeutic potential of Cannabics SR
as a treatment for CACS, we believe that our SR technology may be formulated to serve the unique needs of patients suffering from other
indications for which a sustained release of a cannabinoid formulation may be beneficial. 

Clinical Development 

In 2016, we commenced a two-year pilot study to
evaluate the influence of Cannabics SR capsules on CACS, and, in particular, on weight loss in advanced cancer patients. The study
was led by Professor Gil Bar-Sela, the former Deputy Director of the Division of Oncology at Rambam Health Care Campus, Head of the Palliative
and Supportive Oncology Unit, and Head of Service for Melanoma and Sarcoma Patients. 

5 

Patients were administered 2 10 mg of
Cannabics SR per 24 hours for six months. During the study, after some patients reported several psychoactive side effects, the dosage
of each capsule was reduced to 5 mg. Almost no side effects were reported with the 5 mg dosage. Participants were weighed at each physician
visit. The primary objective of the study was a weight gain of 10 from baseline. Of 24 patients who agreed to participate in the
study, 17 started the Cannabics SR treatment, but only 11 received the capsules for more than two weeks. Three of six patients who
completed the study period met the primary end-point. The remaining three patients had stable weights. In quality-of-life questionnaires
patients reported less appetite loss after the Cannabics SR treatment (p=0.05). According to patients self-reports, improvement
in appetite and mood as well as a reduction in pain and fatigue was demonstrated. 

Despite various limitations, the preliminary study
demonstrated a weight increase of 10 in 3 out of 17 (17.6 of patients with doses of 5 mg 1 or 5 mg 2 capsules daily,
without significant side effects. The remaining patients had stable weights. Also, all patients who remained in the study for at least
4.5 months reported an increase in appetite, as did 83 of the patients who completed the study. For 50 of the patients who completed
the study, there were reports of pain reduction and sleep improvement. Additional results showed a significant decrease of appetite loss
complaints among 83 of the patients who completed the study. (See Bar-Sela, Gil et al. The Effects of Dosage-Controlled

Commercialization 

The results of our planned pilot studies may permit
us to commercialize Cannabics SR in Israel under license by the Israeli Ministry of Health. If we are granted such a permit, we intend
to engage a GMP manufacturer in Israel to produce Cannabics SR capsules for national distribution. 

On May 13, 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Economy
signed a Free Export Order, authorizing the export of GMP certified medical cannabis products from Israel. We are currently evaluating
our export opportunities and optimal commercialization path for Cannabics SR across all available international markets, particularly
with regard to the European Union, Canada, and Australia. 

Cancer and Cancer Anorexia Cachexia Syndrome (CACS)
Market Analysis 

The dynamics of the cancer cachexia market are
expected to shift in the coming years as a result of the positive outcomes of some of the rare candidates during the development stage
by key players that are in the early stages of clinical development have the potential to create a significant positive shift. The emerging
therapies are projected to be launched during the forecast period. In addition, the dearth of effective therapies for this condition presents
a great opportunity for pharma companies to create novel drugs because there is less competition in the cancer cachexia market. Moreover,
the rising awareness about the condition is also impacting the growth of the cancer cachexia market positively. 

The Global Cancer Cachexia Market Size is projected
to reach USD 2.93 billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.8 during the forecast period [2020-2027].

2.2 RCC-33: colorectal cancer
treatment drug candidate 

Our anti-neoplastic flagship product under development,
RCC-33, is an antitumor drug candidate for the treatment of colorectal cancer, which is the 3 rd most diagnosed and 2 nd 
most lethal of all cancers, with approximately 2M new cases being diagnosed annually worldwide and a current market estimated at 12B,
and which is expected to reach 17B by 2027. 

The RCC-33 proprietary formula consists of a specific
synthetic cannabinoid molecular composition that has demonstrated the potential to reduce colorectal cancer tumor volume by over 30 in
repeated in-vivo studies performed. 

Overview 

Cancer and Cannabinoids 

Cancer is a general term used to describe a group
of more than 100 related diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells, leading to the development of a mass
commonly known as a tumor, followed by invasion of the surrounding tissues and subsequent spread, or metastasis, to other parts of the
body. Despite enormous investment in research and the introduction of new treatments, cancer remains a critical area of unmet medical
need. According to the World Health Organization, cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for an estimated
nearly 10 million deaths in 2022. As of January 1, 2022, there were more than 18 million people with a history of cancer living in the
United States, with 2 million new cases and 611,720 cancer deaths expected in 2024 Source: American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts 
Figures 2024). 

Over the past decade, there has been growing interest
in the therapeutic value of cannabinoid compounds in oncology. Cannabis has long been suggested as a well-tolerated, safe, and effective
option to help patients cope with cancer related symptoms by reducing nausea and vomiting, alleviating cancer pain, stimulating appetite,
and improving quality of life. Beyond their palliative benefits, however, cannabinoids have also been receiving increased attention for
their anti-cancer potential, which we believe may one day revolutionize cancer therapy. 

Cannabinoids are a diverse class of chemical compounds
that occur naturally within cannabis plants and are pharmacologically similar to cannabinoids produced by the human body, known as endocannabinoids.
Endocannabinoids form part of the human endocannabinoid system (ECS), a complex biological network that also includes cannabinoid receptors
and enzymes involved in cannabinoid formation, transport, and degradation. The ECS is regarded as an important endogenous system implicated
in regulation of the most vital biological processes to maintain homeostasis, assisting the body to remain stable and balanced despite
external, or environmental, fluctuations (Source: Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2016;22(12):1756-1766) . 

Dysregulation of the ECS owing to variation in
the expression and function of cannabinoid receptors or enzymes or the concentration of endocannabinoids has been associated with several
diseases, including cancer Source: International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 2020;21(3):747 ). Indeed, the mechanisms involved
in the regulation of the ECS as well as the processes that it regulates include practically every pathway important in cancer biology.
Expression of the ECS is altered in numerous types of tumors, compared to healthy tissue, and this aberrant expression has been related
to cancer prognosis and disease outcome, depending on the origin of the cancer Source: British Journal of Pharmacology, 2018;175(13):2566-2580 ).
Recent studies suggest that endocannabinoids contribute to maintaining balance in cell proliferation and that targeting the ECS can affect
cancer growth Source: Canadian Urological Association Journal, 2017;11(3-4):E138-E142 ). 

Cannabinoids can interact with the cannabinoid
receptors in the ECS, sometimes with a higher affinity than endocannabinoids. As a consequence, all the processes regulated by endocannabinoids
are susceptible to interference by cannabinoids. The ability to use cannabinoids to modulate the ECS encompasses several attractive pharmacotherapeutic
targets for systemic anti-cancer treatment and has sparked considerable research examining cannabinoid action on cancer cells Source:
Pharmacological Reviews, 2006;58(3):389-462 ). 

8 

Cannabinoids have demonstrated selective anti-tumor
properties in preclinical studies, exerting anti-proliferative, proapoptotic, anti-angiogenic, and anti-metastatic and anti-inflammatory
effects depending on tumor type and specific setting Source: Cancer Medicine, 2018:7(3):765-775 ). These effects appear to be more
pronounced when cannabinoids are used together versus being administered separately, a mechanism known as the entourage effect .
We believe, therefore, that cannabinoid combinations may hold promise for an improved anti-proliferative strategy for cancer management. 

In addition to their potential role as anti-cancer
agents, cannabinoids have been observed to act synergistically with some conventional antineoplastic drugs, such as chemotherapeutic agents,
enhancing their effectiveness Source: Cancer Medicine, 2018;7(3)765-775 ). This raises the potential for combinational therapies
that may increase the range of chemotherapeutic options available to patients and enable targeting of tumor progression at different levels
while also permitting dosages of cytotoxic drugs to be dramatically reduced without compromising efficacy. 

Figure 2 : Synergistic effects
of cannabis extracts and chemotherapies on cancer biopsy after treatment with the same extract and three different chemotherapy combinations 

As of the date of this filing, we are not aware
of any cannabinoid-based therapies approved for the anti-cancer treatment. 

Our lead product candidate is RCC-33, which we
are developing as a treatment for CRC. RCC-33 is an oral capsule containing a proprietary formulation of cannabinoids that have demonstrated
synergistic efficacy in reducing the viability of human colon cancer cell lines in preclinical studies. 

Colorectal Cancer 

CRC is one of the more common forms of cancer
worldwide, representing a significant challenge to the global healthcare system. According to the World Health Organization, CRC is the
third most diagnosed cancer in the world and the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality. In the United States, there were approximately
1,392,445people living with CRC in 2021( Source: National Cancer Institute. Cancer Stat Facts: Colorectal Cancer ).
In 2024, an estimated 152,810 cases of colon cancer and 44,850 cases of rectal cancer will be diagnosed in the US, and a total of 53,010
people will die from these cancers. In 2024 of all cancers in people over 50, Colorectal cancer was #1 in Men and #2 for Women. Source:
American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts Figures 2024 ). 

9 

Most CRCs begin as a noncancerous growth called
a polyp that develops on the inner lining of the colon or rectum. The most common kind of polyp is called an adenomatous polyp or adenoma.
According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated one-third to one-half of all individuals will eventually develop one or more adenomas.
Although all adenomas have the capacity to become cancerous, fewer than 10 are estimated to progress to invasive cancer. The likelihood
that an adenoma will evolve into cancer increases as it becomes larger or when it acquires certain histopathological characteristics.
Adenomas that become cancerous, called adenocarcinomas, comprise nearly 96 of all CRCs Source: American Cancer Society. Colorectal
Cancer Facts Figures 2020-2022 ). Adenocarcinomas may grow into blood vessels or lymph vessels, increasing the chance
of metastasis to other anatomical sites. 

CRC usually develops slowly, over a period of
10 to 20 years. The complex sequence of events occurring during initiation, development and propagation of adenocarcinomas is likely the
result of a lifelong accumulation of mutations caused by both genetic and environmental factors known as the adenoma to carcinoma sequence.
While the specific cause of any particular case of CRC is often unknown, more than one-half of all cases and deaths are attributable to
lifestyle and environmental factors, such as smoking, unhealthy diet, high alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and excess body weight Source: American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts Figures 2020 ). 

CRC does not usually cause symptoms until the
disease is advanced, therefore early detection of adenomas by screening is vital. If not treated or removed, an adenoma can become a potentially
life-threatening cancer. 

Current Standard of Care 

Treatment options for CRC patients depend on several
factors, including the type and stage of cancer, possible side effects, and the patient s preferences and overall health. Surgical
removal of the tumor is the most common form of treatment, particularly in the early stages of malignancy. Patients with more advanced
stages of CRC may be given adjuvant chemotherapy to kill any cancer cells remaining after surgery, though standard chemotherapy is associated
with severe side effects and provides marginal benefit to the majority of patients. While radiation therapy is often used to treat rectal
cancer, it is not generally recommended for colon cancer patients except in the later stages of the disease Source: American Cancer
Society. Treating Colorectal Cancer . 

CRC is a heterogeneous disease with distinct clinical,
molecular, and pathophysiological characteristics. As a result, the response to treatment is variable between patients, even when they
are diagnosed at the same clinical stage. Such heterogeneity remains an obstacle to the optimization of treatment for each individual.
Researchers are continuing to investigate new treatment options, such as immunotherapy and targeted therapy, that focus upon the genes,
proteins, and other factors in a particular tumor Source: American Cancer Society. Advances in Colorectal Research ). 

Immunotherapy uses the body s own immune
system to kill cancer cells. There are already several FDA-approved immunotherapy options for CRC, such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda ),
nivolumab (Opdivo ), and ipilimumab (Yervoy ). Many immunotherapies that have shown promise in addressing other types of cancer
are also being tested for CRC. While immunotherapy has had some encouraging results, significant limitations remain. Its efficacy is often
unpredictable, and the treatment can lead to the body becoming resistant or result in off-target toxicities where the body s immune
system attacks healthy tissue. Immunotherapy may take longer than other protocols and it is substantially more expensive than classical
treatments Source: Pharmacy Therapeutics, 2017;42(8):514-521 ). 

Targeted therapy uses drugs to target specific
molecules inside cancer cells or on their surface to slow the growth of cancer, destroy cancer cells, and relieve cancer symptoms. There
are different types of targeted therapy drugs, each working differently depending on what molecule the drug is targeting. A treatment
is chosen based on the types of molecules expressed on the patient s tumor cells, which allows doctors to tailor cancer treatment
for each person. Several targeted therapy drugs, such as bevacizumab (Avasin and cetuximab (Erbitux ), are already used to treat
advanced CRC. Despite showing clinical promise, targeted therapy has challenges, such as tumor heterogeneity, off-target toxicity, and
acquired resistance Source: Medical Research Journal, 2019;4(2):99-105 ). The lack of biomarkers by which to identify patients
having a high probability of response is also a particularly significant obstacle. As with immunotherapy, the cost of targeted therapy
is substantially higher than classical treatments. 

10 

We believe that there is no magic bullet 
to cure cancer and that a personalized combination of cancer treatments may be the best course for long term survival benefits in each
case. To that end, the development of more prevention strategies and novel agents will be essential. 

Cannabinoids and Colorectal Cancer 

One area of increasing interest in the treatment
of CRC lies in the development and use of cannabinoid therapeutics. The ECS is regarded as an important regulatory system in the gastrointestinal
tract, being involved in several important functions such as motility, secretion, sensation, inflammation, and carcinogenesis. Recent
studies advocate that the ECS plays a critical role in the development of CRC and should therefore be considered as an appropriate target
for CRC inhibition Source: Frontiers in Pharmacology, 2016;7:361 ). The expression of ECS components in CRC has been found to be
increased and associated with poorer prognosis and advanced stages of disease Source: Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research, 2018, 3(1):272-281 ).
For example, cannabinoid receptors have been found to be overexpressed in tumor cells of the colon and this up-regulation has been postulated
to be an indicator of cancer outcome Source: British Journal of Pharmacology, 2018; 175(13): 2566-2580 ). 

Research on the effects of cannabinoid compounds
on CRC has demonstrated an ability to reduce the viability of CRC cell lines in vitro Source: Cancer Medicine, 2018;7(3):765-775 ),
while there is also convincing scientific evidence that cannabinoids are able to prevent or reduce carcinogenesis in different animal
models of colon cancer Source: Expert Review of Gastroenterology Hepatology, 11:10, 871-873 ). 

We believe that cannabinoids are a promising therapeutic
agent for the treatment of CRC. We have conducted several in vitro unpublished studies using our bioinformatics platform to
confirm that cannabinoids cause necrosis in colon cancer cells. While many cannabinoids demonstrate levels of toxicity on cancer cells,
we have found that certain cannabinoid extracts and combinations show increased levels of toxicity relative to other isolated or combined
cannabinoids. These findings have spurred the development of RCC-33, our product candidate for the treatment of CRC. 

Figure 3 : Synergistic effects
of different cannabinoid combinations on viability of a colon cancer cell line . 

11 

RCC-33 

We are developing RCC-33 as an oral capsule or
solution containing high concentrations of the cannabinoids CBDV and CBGA in a novel formulation, which we believe may be effective in
the treatment of adenocarcinomas of the colon. The cannabinoids in RCC-33 have demonstrated complex synergistic anti-tumor effects in
combination, with no psychoactive effect. In our preclinical in vitro studies evaluating the influence of 15 different cannabinoids
on human colon cancer cell lines (RKO, HCT116), alone and in combination, RCC-33 demonstrated clear efficacy in reducing the viability
of colon cancer cells versus alternative cannabinoid combinations. Importantly, we could detect significant reduction effect on tumour
development in mice inoculated with human colorectal cancer cells. 

12 

Development Plan 

The company, upon financing will prepare to launch
Phase I/II (a) clinical study in 2026, for the evaluation of its lead drug candidates Cannabics SR for the treatment of patients with
advanced cancer and cancer anorexia cachexia syndrome (CACS) and RCC-33 for the treatment of colorectal cancer. We plan to conduct further
preclinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy before proceeding with first-in-human clinical testing. 

Preclinical Studies 

We plan to conduct non-clinical safety studies
following Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) to evaluate the systemic and local toxicity of escalating doses of RCC-33 and establish dosing
parameters. The results of these preclinical studies, which are expected in the second half of 2026, will guide our planned Phase I/II(a)
clinical trial. The non-clinical requirements to support the development program will be verified with the FDA at a pre-IND meeting. Such
studies may include repeated dose toxicity studies, male and female fertility studies, embryofetal development studies, animal abuse related
studies, pharmacokinetics studies, drug-drug interaction studies, and others. 

Clinical Trials 

We plan to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
and pharmacokinetic properties of Cannabis SR and RCC-33 in a Phase I/II(a) ascending dose clinical trial in CRC patients, commencing
in the first quarter 2026. The clinical trial will examine the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of multiple
doses of RCC-33 in CRC patients. We are currently identifying potential contract research organizations and clinical trial centers to
conduct the Phase I/II(a) human proof of concept study, which is estimated to cost 6,500,000. As of the date of this filing, however,
the Company does not have sufficient funds to complete the Phase I/II(a) study. 

Subject to the results from our Phase I trials,
we plan to submit an IND to the FDA for RCC-33 with the clinical protocol for a Phase II double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial
evaluating RCC-33 in patients with CRC at various dosing levels versus placebo. The outcomes from the planned Phase II human proof of
concept trial will inform our decision regarding further steps in the clinical development of RCC-33. 

Our Pipeline: 

In addition to RCC-33 , our colorectal cancer
treatment drug candidate, the company has several other drug candidates under development, including PLP-33 for the local treatment
of Lateral Spreading, or Sessile, colorectal polyps during colonoscopy, BRST-33 for the treatment of breast cancer, MLN-33 
for the treatment of Melanoma and PRST-33 for the treatment of prostate cancer. These additional drug candidates are in the early
stage of development and the company expects to complete the in-vivo research for each product by end of 2026. (see Fig. 4).

2.3 Product
lines currently not actively developed: 

The company has several product lines that are
currently not being actively developed following company s decision to focus its resources and attention exclusively on the development
of its FDA route drug candidates, and SR Capsule described above. The product lines not actively developed include: 

Cannabics CDx evaluate Drug Sensitivity
Test 

Cannabics CDx is an ex-vivo drug sensitivity test
under development to provide healthcare providers with clinical decision support data from which they can identify, for a particular cancer
patient undergoing cannabinoid therapy, which cannabinoids or cannabinoid combinations may have the most beneficial anti-cancer effects,
and which cannabinoids may be contraindicated. 

Company may revisit this decision at a later stage
after launching the first in human clinical studies for the validation of its colorectal cancer treatment drug candidate RCC-33.

According to the National Cancer Institute, Neoadjuvant
Therapy is a "treatment given as a first step to shrink a tumor before the main treatment, which is usually surgery . 

Limitations: 

Mild to severe side effects 

Suppressed immune system 

Potential resistance of tumor residues to postoperative chemotherapy

3.1.1 Neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer 

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard
treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy not only can reduce tumor size and recurrence, but also increase
the tumor resection rate and anus retention rate with very slight side effect. Comparing with preoperative chemotherapy, preoperative
chemoradiotherapy can further reduce the local recurrence rate and downstage. Middle and low rectal cancers can benefit more from neoadjuvant
chemoradiotherapy than high rectal cancer. 

3.1.2 Neoadjuvant therapy in breast
cancer 

In early breast cancer, surgery is the mainstay
of curative treatment. Complementary local radiotherapy and systemic - adjuvant endocrine therapy or chemotherapy treatments are associated
with the aim of reducing the risk of relapse according to the clinicopathological characteristics of the tumor. However, the possibility
of administering these therapies prior to surgery in neoadjuvant setting offers several advantages: 

reduction in tumor size to improve respectability, 

increased rate of conservative surgery improving esthetic results, 

reduction in the extent of axillary surgery, 

early treatment of micrometastatic disease

3.2. Cannabinoid
Neoadjuvant Therapy 

For some time now, the FDA has promoted clinical
studies on Cannabinoids as a growing range of stakeholders has expressed interest in development of drugs that contain cannabis and compounds
found in cannabis. Recent legislative changes have also opened new opportunities for medical cannabis clinical research. As this body
of research progresses and grows, the FDA is working to support drug development in this emerging scientific arena.

4. Outsourced
GMP manufacturing and commercial operation: 

4.1. Outsourced
GMP manufacturing 

Our current position is that all of our Chemistry
Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) required for the approval process of our drug candidates is to be outsourced. The RCC-33 formulation,
as well as all additional drug candidates in our pipeline, while inspired by natural molecules, could consist only of formulations made
from chemically synthesized molecules, or APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) . Our Company is not engaged in the development
of any botanical or botanically based product/s. Additionally, in view of our upcoming submission of a pre-IND meeting request with the
FDA, the Company may enter an new agreement with Purisys, a supplier of GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) grade APIs suited for Clinical
Stage Products. Purisys is a large and long-established US corporation with a long track record of working with the FDA. Accordingly,
under said agreement, we will request that Purisys will also support CNBX throughout an IND filing process, including providing all necessary
and related information concerning CMC in the form of a comprehensive technical package to be presented to the FDA. APIs supplied under
said agreement will be used by Company in Phase I/II (a) clinical studies that it is planning to launch in 2026. 

4.2. Commercial
Operations 

We have not established a sales, marketing, or
product distribution infrastructure. We plan to commercialize any drugs we develop through licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships
with established companies in the pharmaceutical industry having strong marketing capabilities and distribution networks. We generally
intend to advance our drug candidates through Phase I and Phase II clinical trials as appropriate in order to establish their clinical
and commercial potential before negotiating the terms of any licensing or collaboration. We believe that this approach will achieve the
fullest marketing and distribution potential of any drugs or other products that we may develop in the short term. 

18 

5. Our Research and Development: 

To address these problems and improve clinical
outcomes, CNBX Pharmaceuticals focuses on the development of diagnostics that monitor cancer progression and cannabinoid-cancer sensitivity
tests to tailor treatment of cancer with cannabinoid medicine. Utilizing novel High-Throughput Screening (HTS) methods to perform studies
on cancer cell lines and on circulating tumor cells (CTC) derived from cannabis medicated patients. 

We aim to treat a wide scope of cancers both
as the main treatment and as a conjugate to conventional chemotherapy. We believe a significant need remains for novel drugs for patients
who do not respond to existing therapies or for whom these therapies bear undesirable side effects. We recognize the potential therapeutic
applications of the synergistic effects of these active compounds thus building the methodology and procedures that decipher specific
ratios of active compounds in regard to their antitumor activity. 

Once a series of potentially active cannabinoids
is identified for a specific cancer type, we then test and confirm their activity through in vitro and ex-vivo evaluation
studies to determine their potential activity. Through this process, we are able to assess their therapeutic potential. The results of
our pre-clinical experiments provide starting points for our clinical development programs. 

6. Competition: 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries
are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We believe that
our scientific knowledge, experience, technology and development capabilities provide us with competitive advantages, but we face competition
from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions,
governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating
histories and substantially greater financial, scientific, technical, intellectual property, regulatory and human resources than we have,
as well as greater experience in developing and commercializing products, including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals. 

As the medical use of cannabis increasingly receives
government approval worldwide, we face growing competition from many new and existing companies seeking to develop cannabinoid-based therapies.
Companies currently known to be developing cannabinoid-based human therapeutics include GW Pharmaceuticals PLC, Cannabis Science Inc.,
InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc., Emerald Bioscience Inc., Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc., PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc.,
Tetra Bio-Pharma Inc. and Cure Pharmaceutical Holding Corp. 

Many of our competitors are conducting research
targeting the same technologies, applications, and markets as we are. Consequently, they may develop products for the same indications
we are pursuing or may pursue in the future that are more effective, better tolerated, more widely-prescribed or accepted, more useful,
and less costly. Any products that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products, as well as those currently
in development or that may become available in the future. 

In addition to competing for market position,
we will also compete in terms of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, acquiring intellectual property, establishing clinical
trial sites, and enrolling patients for clinical trials and in obtaining funding. 

Given the rapid changes affecting the global,
national, and regional economies in general and cannabis-related medical research and development in particular, we may not be able to
create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Time-to-market is a critical factor in our industry and our success will
depend on our ability to timely develop innovative technologies that will be accepted by patients. Our competitors may be better able
to react to market changes, respond more rapidly to new regulations, or allocate greater resources to the development of their products
than we can, which may result in our technologies and products becoming obsolete before we are able to enter the market, recover the expenses
incurred to develop them, or generate significant revenue. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to develop our product candidates
in a timely manner, keep our future products current with advancing technologies, achieve market acceptance of our future products, gain
name recognition and a positive reputation in the healthcare industry, and establish successful marketing, sales, and distribution efforts.
We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not seriously
harm our business prospects. 

19 

7. Competitive Factors: 

The Pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive
and we will be competing with many other and better financed companies. We are a clinical stage and early stage-biotech pharmaceutical
company, with relatively deminimis cash flow. We compete with other early-stage bio-tech and pharmaceutical companies for financing from
a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in early-stage development companies. The presence of competing early-stage
pharmaceutical companies may impact on our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our research and development if investors
are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on their subjective analysis of our company, the general market
conditions and the price of the investment offered to investors. 

8. Regulations: 

CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc. is purely a Bio-Technology
Pharmaceutical company which licenses use of its Intellectual Property, it does not produce, manufacture or provide any product in any
location. We are duly licensed by the Israeli Health Ministry for our research in Israel. Beyond the Israeli Health Ministry and the FDA
regulatory pathway for our drug candidates as described above, we are not under the aegis of any Federal or State regulatory scheme as
we have no manufacturing activity. Any licensee whom we engage must be duly licensed and certified according to all pertinent local government
regulations in their jurisdiction. The Company is exploring drug development within approved laboratory clinical trial settings conducted
within approved regulatory frameworks. Should any prescription drug product be developed by the Company, such drug product will not be
commercialized prior to receipt of applicable regulatory approval, which will only be granted if clinical evidence of safety and efficacy
for the intended use(s) is successfully developed. 

United States 

In the U.S., the FDA and other federal, state,
local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture,
marketing and distribution of drug products. These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the
testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of
any prescription drug product candidates or commercial products. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with
no guarantee of a positive result. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal
penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product
from the market. 

Cannabis (other than hemp) is strictly controlled
under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811) (the CSA as a Schedule I substance. Schedule I substances
by definition have no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision,
and a high potential for abuse. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing
and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. Anyone wishing to conduct research on substances listed in
Schedule I under the CSA must register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the DEA ), and obtain DEA approval
of the research proposal. For any product containing cannabis to be available for commercial marketing in the United States, cannabis
must be rescheduled, or the product itself must be scheduled, by the DEA to Schedule II, III, IV or V. Scheduling determinations by the
DEA are dependent on FDA approval of a substance or a specific formulation of a substance. 

The process required before a prescription drug product candidate may
be marketed in the United States generally involves: 

completion of extensive non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA s Good Laboratory, Good Clinical and/or Manufacturing Practice regulations; 

submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

approval by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 

for some products, performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA s regulations, including Good Clinical Practices, to establish the safety and efficacy of the prescription drug product candidate for each proposed indication; 

submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application NDA 

Satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and 

FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug. 

20 

The testing and approval process requires substantial
time, effort and financial resources, and the Company cannot be certain that any approvals for its prescription drug product candidates
will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations
of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies. The results
of non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some non-clinical
testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials
and an investigator s brochure. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within
the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical
trial on a clinical hold. In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical
trials can begin. Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance
with regulatory requirements. 

An independent institutional review board, at
each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it
commences at that center. An independent institutional review board considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating
in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The independent institutional review board also approves
the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the independent institutional review
board, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects
are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed
clinical trials to public registries. 

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing
approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In general in Phase 1, the initial introduction
of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions,
side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials
in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage,
and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety
profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and
safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall
benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires
two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. The FDA may, however, determine
that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. Only a small percentage of investigational drugs
complete all three phases and obtain marketing approval. In some cases, the FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4
studies, to be conducted as a condition of approval in order to gather additional information on the drug s effect in various populations
and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the risks posed by the drugs, other post-market requirements may be imposed. 

After completion of the required clinical testing,
an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the
U.S. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product s
pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. 

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an
NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency s threshold determination that it is sufficiently
complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the statute
and implementing regulations, the FDA has 180 days (the initial review cycle) from the date of filing to issue either an approval
letter or a complete response letter, unless the review period is adjusted by mutual agreement between the FDA and the applicant
or as a result of the applicant submitting a major amendment. In practice, the performance goals established pursuant to the Prescription
Drug User Fee Act have effectively extended the initial review cycle beyond 180 days. The FDA s current performance
goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) NDAs within 10 months of receipt
and within six months for priority NDAs, but two additional months are added to standard and priority NDAs for a new molecular
entity, or NME. 

21 

The FDA may also refer applications for novel
drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a
panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be
approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving
an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the
facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current GMP
is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing
facilities, it issues either a n approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies
in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application.
If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an
approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing 90 percent of resubmissions within two to six months depending on the type of
information included. 

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing
of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk
evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include
medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but
are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special
monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability
of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug s safety
or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are
identified following initial marketing. 

The FDA offers a number of regulatory mechanisms
that provide expedited or accelerated approval procedures for selected drugs and indications which are designed to address unmet medical
needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These include programs such as Breakthrough Therapy designations,
Fast Track designations, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, which the Company may need to rely upon in order to receive timely
approval or to be competitive. 

The Company may plan to seek orphan drug designation
for certain indications qualified for such designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs
intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which, in the U.S., is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer
than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable
expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be
recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. If a product that has an orphan
drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product
is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the
same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the U.S. Orphan drug designation
does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the same indication or the same drug for different indications.
After orphan drug designation is granted, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed. Orphan
drug designation does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the development, review and approval process. However, this
designation provides an exemption from marketing and authorization fees. 

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to
FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping,
periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, and complying with promotion
and advertising requirements. The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example,
the FDA may require post-market testing, including phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product s
safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture
and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject
to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including
current Good Manufacturing Practices, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements. Failure to comply with statutory
and regulatory requirements may subject a manufacturer to legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing,
product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program
user fee. 

22 

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with
regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of
previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes,
or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements
for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a risk
evaluation and mitigation strategy. 

Controlled Substances 

The CSA and its implementing regulations establish
a closed system of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting,
storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is responsible for regulating
controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense
controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit
channels of commerce. 

Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import
or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies)
and controlled substance schedule(s). For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration
will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. 

The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities
to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security
requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent
requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks
on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm
systems and surveillance cameras. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt
and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I
and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled
substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. Imports of Schedule
I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier
or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and
exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit
import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics. 

For drugs manufactured in the United States, the
DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the number of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced
in the United States based on the DEA s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial
needs. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may
adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the
year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies. 

Individual U.S. states also establish and maintain
separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements.
State authorities, including boards of pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with
applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action
that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil
penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations
could lead to criminal prosecution.

9. Employees: 

As of August 31, 2024, the Company had 2 employees,
our Directors Gabriel Yariv and Eyal Barad, both residing in Israel. 

Israeli labor laws principally govern the length
of the workday, minimum wages for employees, procedures for hiring and dismissing employees, determination of severance pay, annual leave,
sick days, advance notice of termination of employment, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws and other conditions of employment.
Subject to certain exceptions, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the retirement, death or dismissal of an employee, and
requires us and our employees to make payments to the National Insurance Institute, which is similar to the U.S. Social Security Administration.
Our employees have defined benefit pension plans that comply with applicable Israeli legal requirements, which also include the mandatory
pension payments required by applicable law and allocations for severance pay.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Risk Factors 

You should consider carefully the risks and
uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following
risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.
The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

Risks Related to Our Company and Business 

Our independent auditors have expressed substantial
doubt about our ability to continue operating as a going concern, which could prevent us from obtaining new financing on reasonable terms
or at all. 

Our independent registered public accountants
have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to
raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will
not be able to complete our proposed business. As a result, we may have to liquidate our business and investors may lose their investments.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish our plan of operations described in
this filing, obtain financing and eventually attain profitable operations. Investors should consider our independent registered public
accountant s comments when deciding whether to invest in the Company. 

We have not generated any significant revenue
since our inception and we may never achieve profitability. 

We are an early-stage biotechnology company and
have not generated any significant revenue since we commenced our present operations in April 2014. At the present time, Cannabics SR
is the only product that we have commercialized. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of common
stock, warrants, and direct equity investments. As we continue our research and development of cannabinoid-based diagnostics, our expenses
are expected to increase significantly. Accordingly, we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability. Even as we
begin to commercialize our technologies, we expect our losses to continue as a result of ongoing research and development expenses. These
losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets and stockholders 
equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization efforts, we are unable
to predict at what stage the Company will become profitable. We may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may
not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to achieve and then maintain profitability,
our business, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively affected, and the market value of our common stock will
decline. 

Since we have a limited operating history in
our business, it is difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business. 

We commenced operations as a biotechnology company
in April 2014, and therefore have a relatively short operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can objectively
be made. Our business is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have not demonstrated an ability
to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in new and rapidly evolving
competitive fields, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other resources
and lack of revenue. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the early stage of our operations. There is no assurance
that our business will ever be successful or that we will be able to attain profitability. Any failure by the Company to report profits
may adversely affect the price of our common stock. 

25 

We will need to raise additional capital to
meet our business requirements in the future, which may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute our stockholders ownership
interests. 

The Company has not yet generated significant
revenue and will require additional capital to continue its research and development activities, conduct clinical trials, commercialize
its products and otherwise fund its operations. Our ability to secure required financing will depend in part upon investor perception
of our ability to create a successful business. Capital market conditions and other factors beyond our control may also play important
roles in our ability to raise capital. There can be no assurance that debt or equity financing will be available or sufficient for our
requirements or for other corporate purposes, or if debt or equity financing is available, that it will be on terms acceptable to us.
Moreover, future activities may require us to alter our capitalization significantly. Our inability to access sufficient capital for our
operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we are unable to obtain
additional funding as needed, we may be required to reduce the scope of our research and development activities, which could harm our
business plan, financial condition and operating results, or we may be required to cease our operations entirely, in which case, our investors
will lose all of their investment. 

Any additional capital raised through the sale
of equity or equity-backed securities may dilute our stockholders ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in
the market value of our equity securities. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable
to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which
may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of our securities then outstanding. Any debt financing secured in the future could involve
restrictive covenants relating to capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult
for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. 

In addition, we may incur substantial costs in
pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing
and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities
we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition. 

We are highly dependent on the success of cannabinoid
technology, and we may not be able to develop the technology, successfully obtain regulatory or marketing approval for, or successfully
commercialize, our products or product candidates. 

Our business is focused entirely upon the research,
development and commercialization of cannabinoid-based technologies for the detection and treatment of cancer. Our success is dependent
upon the viability of this technology and the development of cancer diagnostics and therapies. 

We have not received regulatory approval from
the FDA to market any diagnostics or therapeutics based on botanical cannabinoids. The FDA has approved Epidiolex (CBD) oral solution
for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, in patients
two years of age and older. This is the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified drug substance derived from cannabis. The FDA
has also approved two drugs that contain a synthetic substance that acts similarly to cannabis compounds but is not present in the cannabis
plant. 

The scientific evidence underlying the feasibility
of developing cannabinoid-based technologies for the detection and treatment of cancer is both preliminary and limited. In 2017, an ad
hoc committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine determined that while there is conclusive or substantial
evidence that oral cannabinoids are effective antiemetics in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, there was insufficient
evidence to make any statement about the efficacy of cannabinoids as a treatment for cancer. The ad hoc committee went on to state
that further clinical research into the anti-cancer effects of cannabinoids needs to be conducted. 

If our cannabinoid technology is found to be ineffective
or unsafe in humans, or if it never receives regulatory approval for commercialization, we may never be able bring our product candidates
to market and may never become profitable. Further, our current business strategy, including all of our research and development, is focused
on utilizing cannabinoid technology to detect and treat cancer. This lack of diversification increases the risk associated with the ownership
of our common stock. If we are unsuccessful in developing and commercializing our cannabinoid-based technology and its application to
the detection and treatment of cancer, we may be required to alter our scope and direction and steer away from the intellectual property
we have developed as well as the core capabilities of our management team and advisory board. Without successful commercialization of
our products and product candidates, we may never become profitable, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition. 

26 

Our success depends upon our ability to retain
our senior management and our ability to attract, retain and motivate other qualified personnel. 

We are an early-stage biotechnology company. As
of August 31, 2024, we had two employees and several consultants. Our success materially depends upon the efforts of our management and
personnel. If we lose the services of any of our executive officers or significant employees, our business would likely be materially
and adversely affected. At this time, we do not currently have key man life insurance for or any other executive officer. 

Because of the specialized scientific and managerial
nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel.
The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology industry is intense. Due to this intense competition, we may be unable to
continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.
Any difficulties in obtaining and retaining qualified officers, employees and consultants could have a material adverse effect on our
operations. 

The relative lack of public company experience
by our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage. 

As a company with a class of securities registered
under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we are subject to reporting and
other legal, accounting, corporate governance, and regulatory requirements imposed by the Exchange Act and rules and regulations promulgated
under the Exchange Act. With the exception of our CFO, Elkana Amitai , our management team lacks significant public company experience,
which could impair our ability to comply with these legal, accounting, and regulatory requirements. Such responsibilities include complying
with securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our senior management may not be able to implement and effect
programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to such increased legal and regulatory compliance and
reporting requirements. Our failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and further result in the deterioration
of our business. 

If we are unable to enter into acceptable sales,
marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties or establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be
successful in commercializing any product candidate that we develop if and when a product candidate is approved. 

We do not have any sales, marketing or distribution
infrastructure and have no experience in the commercialization of biotechnology. To achieve commercial success for any product, we must
develop a sales and marketing organization, outsource these functions to third parties or license our products to others. 

While we generally intend to adopt a licensing
model for the commercialization of our products, we may also seek one or more strategic partners for commercialization of our products
outside the United States. As a result of entering into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services,
our product revenue or the profitability of our product revenue may be lower, perhaps substantially lower, than if we were to directly
market and sell products in those markets. Furthermore, we may be unsuccessful in entering into the necessary arrangements with third
parties or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, we may have little or no control over such third parties
and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our product candidates effectively. 

If we do not license our products or outsource
our commercialization efforts, we will be required to develop our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which will require
substantial resources and will be time-consuming, and could delay any product launch. Moreover, we may not be able to hire or retain a
sales force that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise in the consumer health markets that we plan to target. If we are unable
to establish or retain a sales force and marketing and distribution capabilities, our operating results may be adversely affected. 

If we do not successfully license our products
or establish sales and marketing capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, it is likely that we will be
unable to commercialize any of our products. 

27 

We face intense competition, often from companies
with greater resources and experience than we have, which may result in others developing or commercializing competing products before
us or more successfully. 

The market for cancer diagnostics and therapies
is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities
of industry participants. Our competitors include large multinational corporations and their operating units, including Abbott Laboratories
Inc., Cepheid Inc., Philips, GE Healthcare, Siemens, Gen-Probe Incorporated, MDxHealth SA, EpiGenomics AG, Roche Diagnostics, Exact Sciences
Corporation, Sequenom, Inc. and several others. We also compete against pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and
biotechnology companies worldwide, as well as smaller and other early-stage companies. Other potential competitors include academic institutions,
government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative
arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. 

Many of our competitors and potential competitors
have or will have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than
we have, and many have been engaged in the biotechnology industry for a much longer time than we have. Many of our competitors spend significantly
more funds on research, development, promotion and sale of new and existing products than we do, and may therefore be able to react more
quickly to new or emerging technologies, shifting market conditions and regulatory changes. 

There can be no assurance that any of our current
or future products and technologies will have a competitive advantage in the marketplace, or that they will remain competitive following
the introduction of competing products or technologies. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop
and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in the face of increasing competition from new technologies or products introduced by existing companies in the industry or
by new companies entering the market. 

If we are unable to compete successfully, there
may be a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If the marketplace does not accept the products
in our development pipeline or any other diagnostic products we might develop, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain
and grow our business. 

Even if we are able to successfully develop and
obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate, our ability to generate significant revenue will depend on the acceptance of our products
by physicians and patients. Physicians, hospitals, clinical laboratories, researchers or others in the healthcare industry may not use
our current or future diagnostic product candidates unless they are determined to be an effective and cost-efficient means of detecting
and diagnosing cancer. Market acceptance of our current or future therapeutic products will depend on a number of factors, including the
indication statement and warnings approved by regulatory authorities in the product label, continued demonstration of efficacy and safety
in commercial use, physicians willingness to prescribe the product, reimbursement from third-party payers such as government healthcare
systems and insurance companies, the price of the product, the nature of any post-approval risk management plans mandated by regulatory
authorities, competition, marketing and distribution support. In addition, we will need to expend a significant amount of resources on
marketing and educational efforts to create awareness of our products and to encourage their acceptance and adoption. If the market for
our products does not develop sufficiently or the products are not accepted, our revenue potential will be harmed. 

28 

We are exposed to potential product liability
risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of cancer diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. 

While we do not presently carry any product liability
insurance coverage, we intend to obtain such insurance in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable for our current level of activity
and exposure. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to obtain or maintain insurance coverage that will be adequate to cover
our potential liabilities, or that premiums will be commercially justifiable. Furthermore, insurance that might otherwise be readily available,
may be more difficult for us to find and more expensive because we work with medicinal cannabis. If we are the subject of a successful
product liability claim that exceeds the limits of, or is not otherwise covered by our insurance, or if we incur such liability at a time
when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, we may incur substantial charges that adversely affect our earnings and require the
commitment of capital resources that might otherwise be available for the development and commercial launch of our product programs. 

If we fail to protect our intellectual property
rights, our ability to pursue the development of our technologies and products would be negatively affected. 

Our success will depend in part on our ability
to protect our intellectual property. This is done, in part, by obtaining patents and trademarks and then maintaining adequate protection
of our technologies, tradenames and products. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use
our technologies to produce and market products in direct competition with us and erode our competitive advantage. Some foreign countries
lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United
States. Many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries. We may not be able to prevent
misappropriation of our proprietary rights. 

We are currently seeking patent protection for
several processes and finished products. However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be
no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include
the following: 

patents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage; 

our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our products and product candidates either in the United States or in international markets; 

there may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; 

countries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products. 

Any patents issued to us may not provide us with
meaningful protection, and third parties may challenge, circumvent or narrow them. Third parties may also independently develop products
similar to our products or product candidates, duplicate our unpatented product or product candidates, and design around any patents on
product candidates we may develop. 

29 

Additionally, extensive time is required for development,
testing and regulatory review of product candidates. While extension of a patent term due to regulatory delays may be available, it is
possible that before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent, even with an extension, may expire or remain
in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent. 

In addition, the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (the USPTO ), and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning biotechnology-related
inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby
limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents
may be substantially narrower than anticipated. 

In addition to patents, we rely on a combination
of trade secrets, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and
proprietary information. These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information. If they do not
adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technology, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have. In addition,
others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could
impair any competitive advantage we may have. 

Costly litigation may be necessary to protect
our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims alleging the violation of the intellectual property rights of others. 

We may face significant expense and liability
as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents and other intellectual property rights of others. If another party
has also filed a patent application or been issued a patent relating to an invention or technology claimed by us in pending applications,
we may be required to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could
result in substantial uncertainties and costs, even if the eventual outcome were favorable to us. We could also be required to participate
in interference proceedings involving issued patents and pending applications of another entity. An adverse outcome in an interference
proceeding could require us to cease using the technology or to license rights from prevailing third parties. 

The cost to us of any patent litigation or other
proceeding relating to our patents or patent applications, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Our ability to enforce
our patent protection could be limited by our financial resources, and may be subject to lengthy delays. 

A third party might claim that we are using inventions
claimed by their patents and might go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as research, development
and the sale of any future products. Such lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources. There is a risk that the
court will decide that we are infringing the third party s patents and will order us to stop the activities claimed by the patents,
redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement or obtain licenses (which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms).
In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having infringed their patents. 

There is no guarantee that any prevailing patent
owner would offer us a license so that we could continue to engage in activities claimed by the patent, or that such a license, if made
available to us, could be acquired on commercially acceptable terms. In addition, third parties may, in the future, assert other intellectual
property infringement claims against us with respect to our products, technologies or other matters. 

Failure in our information technology or storage
systems could significantly disrupt our operations and our research and development efforts, which could adversely impact our revenues,
as well as our research, development and commercialization efforts. 

Our ability to execute our business strategy depends,
in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology IT ), systems, which support our operations
and our research and development efforts, as well as our storage systems. Due to the sophisticated nature of the technology we use in
our products and service offerings, we are substantially dependent on our IT systems. IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety
of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security
and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar
disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems,
sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data, could adversely affect our ability to
operate our business.

We will need to grow the size of our organization,
and we may experience difficulties in managing any growth we may achieve. 

As of the date of this filing, we have two full-time
employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies progress, we expect to need additional research, development,
managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, accounting, legal and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added
responsibilities on our management, which may not be able to accommodate those added responsibilities. If we fail to effectively manage
our future growth, it could delay the execution of our business plan and disrupt our operations. 

We are subject to financial reporting and other
requirements that place significant demands on our resources. 

We are subject to reporting and other obligations
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section
404 requires us to conduct an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. These
reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, internal audit and accounting
resources. The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing
audit reports to stockholders causes our expenses to be higher than they would be if we remained a privately-held company. The increased
costs associated with operating as a public company may decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may cause us to reduce costs
in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our product to offset the effect of such increased costs. Additionally, if these
requirements divert our management s attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s
internal controls over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework
(COSO 2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission. On the basis of that assessment, management
determined that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of that date. 

Effective internal controls are necessary for
us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable
assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Pursuant
to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including
management s assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls,
or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation
of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to
implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results
could be adversely impacted, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and our business and stock price could be adversely affected. 

At August 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and concluded that, subject to the inherent limitations identified in Item 9A
of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective as of that date. 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of August 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was
no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the six-month period ended August 30, 2024 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Risks Related to Cannabis 

Our failure to comply with controlled substance
legislation could restrict or harm our ability to develop and commercialize our products. 

Our business is, and will be, subject to wide-ranging
laws and regulations of Israel, the United States (federal and state), the European Community and other governments in each of the countries
where we may develop and market our products. We must comply with all regulatory requirements if we expect to be successful. 

Most countries are parties to the Single Convention
on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances,
including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to
us obtaining marketing approval in those countries for any cannabinoid-based products we develop. These countries may not be willing or
able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit our products to be marketed, or achieving such amendments to the
laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time. In the case of countries with similar obstacles, we would be unable to market
our product candidates in countries in the near future or perhaps at all if the laws and regulations in those countries do not change. 

Any cannabinoid-based product candidate that we
may develop for use in the United States, will be subject to U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations that will require us, along
with our collaborators and licensees, to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including, if applicable,
manufacturing, production, quality control and assurance and clinical trials. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or
the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, could adversely affect the results of our business operations and our financial
condition. 

The constant evolution of laws and regulations
affecting the research and development of cannabis-based diagnostics and therapies could detrimentally affect our business. Laws and regulations
related to the therapeutic uses of cannabis are subject to changing interpretations. These changes may require us to incur substantial
costs associated with legal and compliance fees and ultimately require us to alter our business plan. Furthermore, violations or alleged
violation of these laws could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations, including our ability to
conduct clinical trials that are prerequisite to our ability to commercialize our cannabis-based medical products and therapies. We cannot
predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications of laws and regulations and it is possible that new
laws and regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. 

Cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal
law, and any change in the enforcement priorities of the federal government could render our current and planned future operations unprofitable
or even prohibit such operations. 

We are a biotechnology company focused on the
research and development of cannabinoid-based diagnostics, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals and palliative therapies. The commercial viability
of our products and technologies in the United States depends, in part, on state laws and regulations; however, Cannabis remains illegal
under US federal law. 

The United States federal government regulates
drugs through the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (the CSA ), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, on
one of five schedules. Cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, which is viewed as having a high potential
for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. No prescriptions may be written for Schedule I substances,
and such substances are subject to production quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation imposed by the United States
Drug Enforcement Administration (the DEA ). Because of this, doctors may not prescribe cannabis for medical use under federal
law, although they can recommend its use under the First Amendment. 

Currently, thirty-seven U.S. states and the District
of Columbia allow the use of medical cannabis. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia also allow its recreational use. Because cannabis
is a Schedule I controlled substance, however, the development of a legal cannabis industry under the laws of these states is in conflict
with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. The United States Supreme
Court has confirmed that the federal government has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, including for medical purposes, and
that federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis pre-empts state laws that legalize its use. 

32 

In 2014, the United States House of Representatives
passed an amendment (the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations
Bill, which funds the United States Department of Justice (the DOJ ). The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment prohibits the DOJ from
using funds to prevent states with medical cannabis laws from implementing such laws. In August 2016, a Ninth Circuit federal appeals
court ruled in United States v. McIntosh that the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment bars the DOJ from spending funds on the prosecution
of conduct that is allowed by state medical cannabis laws, provided that such conduct is in strict compliance with applicable state law.
While the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has been included as a rider to the Consolidated Appropriations Acts every year since 2014, there
can be no assurances that the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment will be included in future appropriations bills or budget resolutions. The federal
government could at any time change its enforcement priorities against the cannabis industry. We do not grow or distribute cannabis, but
our current and planned business operations may involve licensing cannabinoid-based products and technology. Any change in enforcement
priorities could render such operations unprofitable or even prohibit such operations. 

Our ability to earn revenue through licensing
our product in the United States is dependent on additional states legalizing medical marijuana. 

We are engaged in the business developing and
commercializing cannabinoid-based products for the detection and treatment of cancer. Our ability to commercialize our products in the
United States is dependent upon the continued progress of legislative authorization of cannabis at the state level for medical purposes
and, in certain states, based on the specifics of the legislation passed in that state. Any number of factors could slow or halt the progress.
Furthermore, progress, while encouraging, is not assured. The legislative process normally encounters set-backs before achieving success.
While there may be ample public support for legislative proposals, there must be political will in the legislative committee or a bill
may never advance to a vote. Numerous factors impact the legislative process. Any one of these factors could slow or halt the progress
and adoption of cannabis for medical purposes, which would limit the market for our products and negatively impact our business and revenues. 

Changes in consumer preferences and acceptance
of medical cannabis, or any negative trends, will adversely affect our business. 

Our business is substantially dependent on market
acceptance of medical cannabis. Market perception of medical cannabis can be significantly influenced by a number of social, political
and economic factors that are beyond our control, including scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media
attention and other publicity regarding such products and treatments. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings,
regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the market for any of
our current or future cannabinoid-based diagnostics or therapies. Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation,
media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or
publicity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products, as well as our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows. 

We believe that as cannabis-based biotechnology
becomes more widely accepted by the U.S. medical community and the public at large, the stigma associated with medical cannabis will moderate
and, as a result, consumer demand will likely continue to grow. There is, however, no assurance that such increase in demand will occur,
that we will benefit from any demand increase or that our business will ever become profitable. We cannot predict the future growth rate
and size of the market, assuming that the regulatory climate permits, of which there can be no assurance. Any negative outlook on medical
cannabis will adversely affect our business prospects. 

We also believe that large, well-funded pharmaceutical
and other related businesses and industries may have economic reasons to oppose cannabinoid-based therapies. The pharmaceutical industry
is well-funded with a strong and experienced lobby presence at both the federal and state levels, as well as internationally, that surpasses
financial resources of the current group of medical cannabis research and development companies. Any effort by the pharmaceutical lobby
to halt or delay cannabinoid-based medical products and therapies could have a detrimental impact on our business. 

33 

Risks Related to Product Development 

If we fail to successfully develop and commercialize
diagnostics, pharmaceutical or therapies, we may be unable to execute our plan of operations. 

Our current business strategy focuses on discovering,
developing and commercializing cannabinoid-based diagnostics, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals and palliative therapies. To date, we have only
commercialized Cannabics SR, our non-pharmaceutical extended release capsules for palliative therapy. The success of our business will
depend upon our ability to fully develop and commercialize the diagnostics and therapeutic product candidates in our current development
pipeline as well as to continue the discovery and development of other products and technology. 

Prior to commercializing our product candidates,
we will be required to undertake time-consuming and costly development activities with uncertain outcomes, including conducting clinical
studies and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval in Israel, the United States, the European Union and other countries where we may
develop and market our product candidates. Delays in obtaining approvals and clearances could have material adverse effects on us and
our ability to fully carry out our plan of operations. We have limited experience in taking products through these processes and there
are considerable risks involved in these activities. The science and methods that we are employing are innovative and complex, and it
is possible that our development programs will ultimately not yield products suitable for commercialization or government approval. Product
candidates that appear promising in early development may fail to be validated in subsequent studies, and even if we achieve positive
results, we may still fail to obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals. Few research and development projects result in
commercial products, and perceived viability in early clinical studies often is not replicated in later studies. At any point, we may
abandon development of a product candidate, or we may be required to expend considerable resources obtaining additional clinical and nonclinical
data, which would adversely impact the timing for generating potential revenue from those products. Further, our ability to develop and
launch product candidates is dependent on our receipt of substantial additional funding. If our discovery and development programs yield
fewer commercial product candidates than we expect, we may be unable to execute our business plan, and our business, financial condition
and results of operations may be adversely affected. 

If we fail to maintain or establish satisfactory
arrangements for the supply of raw materials or the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical or clinical trials, or if we
experience an interruption of supply, we might not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates at an acceptable cost, which could
delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts 

We do not produce medical cannabis, and therefore
our ability to research, develop and commercialize our cannabinoid-based diagnostics and therapeutic product candidates is dependent upon
a sufficient supply of medical cannabis strains. Any significant interruption or negative change in the availability or economics of the
supply chain for medical cannabis could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Some strains of medical
cannabis may only be available from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. If a sole source supplier were to go out of business,
we might be unable to find a replacement source in a timely manner or at all. If a sole source supplier were to be acquired by a competitor,
that competitor might elect not to supply us. Any inability to secure required supplies of medical cannabis or to do so on appropriate
terms could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. 

34 

Our clinical diagnostics may never be validated. 

The FDA regulates the sale and distribution, in
interstate commerce, of in vitro diagnostic test kits, reagents and instruments used to perform diagnostic testing. To the extent
that any diagnostic test we develop is regarded as an in vitro diagnostic test rather than as a Laboratory Developed Test LDT ),
we will be subject to increased FDA regulation that will delay and add to the cost of commercialization of our diagnostic product candidates,
which will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We are also subject to the United States Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 CLIA ), federal regulatory standards that apply to all clinical laboratories that
perform testing on specimens derived from humans in the United States for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention
or treatment of disease. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating
specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management,
quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Accreditation by the College of American Pathologists CAP ), one of
six CLIA-approved accreditation organizations, is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of CLIA. 

The validation for CLIA or CAP is a two-step process.
The first step is optimization of all of the steps of the test protocol to show that the test is able to produce repeatable and consistent
results. The second step is the clinical validation, in which statistically significant sensitivity and specificity of the test on the
appropriate human samples are determined. Overall, the purpose of the validation process is to determine the accuracy, precision, sensitivity
and specificity of the test. The time and cost to complete the validation process can vary widely, and it is possible that we would be
unable to complete the validation process along the timeline and within the budget as planned. 

As of the date of this filing, our clinical diagnostics
have not yet been validated for commercialization in a CLIA or CAP laboratory, and we have not yet begun the validation process. We may
be unable to enter into an agreement with a CLIA or CAP laboratory on favorable terms, or at all. Although we may be able to validate
the tests, they might have sensitivity and specificity that is insufficient to bring the product to market. Any delays or incurrence of
greater costs than budgeted in validating these tests may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. 

The Federal Food and Drug Administration may
impose additional regulatory obligations and costs upon the development of our diagnostics. 

On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued draft guidance
regarding oversight of LDTs, titled Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs). According to
this guidance, the FDA plans to take a phased-in risk-based approach to regulating LDTs. The FDA plans to phase in enforcement of LTD
premarket review, quality system oversight and adverse event reporting over a number of years. The FDA would require that laboratories
providing LDTs, subject to certain limited exemptions, within six months after the guidance documents are finalized to comply with (i)
either a new notification procedure in which the laboratory must provide the FDA with certain basic information about each LDT offered
by their laboratory or the FDA s device registration and listing requirements, and (ii) the medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements
for LDTs offered by that laboratory. Under this new risk-based approach, it is possible that some level of pre-market review may be required
for our LDTs, which may require us to obtain additional clinical data. 

The FDA draft guidance was subject to public comment
until February 2, 2015. On January 13, 2017, the FDA issued a discussion paper on LDTs that does not represent the formal position of
FDA and is not enforceable, but is intended to advance public discussion on future LDT oversight. At the present time, we cannot assess
what the additional costs and regulatory burdens of any FDA final guidance or FDA enforcement will be, or the impact it may have on our
business and operations. 

If the FDA requires us to seek clearance or approval
for any of our diagnostic products (as opposed to simply licensing our technology to a CLIA lab), we may not be able to obtain such approvals
on a timely basis, or at all. The cost of conducting clinical trials and otherwise developing data and information to support any applications
may be significant. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA could result in enforcement action, including
receiving untitled or warning letters, fines, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. In addition, we could be subject to a recall
or seizure of products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production. Any such enforcement action would
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations. 

35 

Changes in laws and regulations concerning
clinical diagnostic tests may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The clinical laboratory testing industry is highly
regulated, and failure to comply with applicable regulatory, supervisory or licensing requirements may adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. In particular, the laws and regulations governing the marketing and research of clinical
diagnostic testing are extremely complex and in many instances there are no clear regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws
and regulations, which increase the risk that we may be found to be in violation of these laws. 

The regulatory environment in which we operate
may change significantly and adversely in the future. The molecular diagnostics industry as a whole is a growing industry and regulatory
agencies such as the FDA may also apply heightened scrutiny to new developments in the field of molecular diagnostics. Should we be deemed
to not be in compliance with regulatory requirements or any changes thereto, we may be subject to sanctions which could include required
changes to our operations, adverse publicity, substantial financial penalties and criminal proceedings. Any change in the laws and the
regulations relating to our business, whether in the form of new or amended laws or regulations or regulatory policies, or the application
of any of the above, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our costs to comply
with the new laws or constraining our ability to develop, market and commercialize our diagnostic tests. 

For example, a development affecting our industry
is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act's "whistleblower"
or " qui tam " provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly
presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal governmental payer program. The qui tam 
provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government for violations
of the False Claims Act and permit such individuals to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in fines or settlement.
When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it is subject to mandatory damages of three times the actual damages
sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties ranging from 5,500 to 11,000 for each false claim. In addition, various
states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, and in some cases go even further because many of these
state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a governmental payer program. 

In addition, there has been a recent trend of
increased U.S. federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians, which are governed by laws and regulations including the Stark
Law. Among other requirements, the Stark Law requires laboratories to track, and places a cap on, non-monetary compensation provided to
referring physicians. While we have a compliance plan to address compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, the
evolving commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions
with different compliance and reporting requirements increases the possibility that we could violate one or more of these requirements. 

All of our diagnostics and therapeutic product
candidates are in clinical and preclinical development, the validation of which may not be successful and may be subject to delays, which
would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. 

To date, we have devoted our resources towards
developing the technology upon which we are building our clinical diagnostics and therapeutic product candidates. Our clinical diagnostic
product candidates have yet to be validated and our clinical therapeutic product candidates are currently in a preclinical development
phase. As of the date of this filing, only Cannabics SR, our non-pharmaceutical palliative therapy, has been commercialized. 

We may be unable to successfully complete the
clinical validation process for our diagnostic product candidates due to several factors, including our ability to acquire enough samples
for full validation and the procurement of materials necessary to conduct testing. 

We may not be able to successfully complete the
preclinical testing necessary to advance our therapeutic product candidates into clinical development, including animal pharmacology and
toxicity studies. The results of any preclinical work may indicate that our therapeutic product candidates do not have the safety or efficacy
necessary to file an Investigational New Drug IND with the FDA in order to move our product on to the clinical development
process. 

Once we initiate the clinical development of our
product candidates, it may be difficult to identify and qualify patients to participate in future clinical trials for our product candidates,
and the timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing as well as completion
of required follow-up periods. If patients are unwilling to participate in our clinical trials due to concerns over the safety of the
product candidate or for other reasons, the timeline for conducting the trials and obtaining regulatory approval may be delayed. Furthermore,
we may also compete for patients with other companies conducting similar clinical trials. Any delays in our future clinical trials could
result in increased costs, delays in product development or termination of the clinical trials altogether. 

Any of these events could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

36 

We may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy
of our therapeutic product candidates in accordance with regulatory standards and may incur delays and substantial costs in our clinical
trials. 

In order to commercialize our therapeutic product
candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. The clinical
testing process is expensive, difficult to design and implement, takes many years to complete and is unpredictable in both its duration
and outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. There is a high failure rate for drugs and biological
products proceeding through clinical trials. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing,
advertising and promotion, pricing, export, import and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and
other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted
to market our therapeutic product candidates as a prescription pharmaceutical product in the United States until we receive approval of
a New Drug Application NDA ), from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such
countries. In the United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of each drug to
establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical development to ensure its quality before an NDA is approved. Regulatory
authorities in other jurisdictions impose similar requirements. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result
in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are eventually approved for commercialization. We have not submitted an NDA to the
FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities. Preclinical and clinical data is often susceptible to varying interpretations
and types of analyses and regulatory authorities may fail to approve our product. In addition, even if we successfully complete early
clinical trials, such results may not be indicative of the success or results of our later clinical trials. 

Our successful completion of clinical trials may
be materially adversely affected by many factors, including: 

ineffective trial design and disagreement with the FDA on final trial design; 

imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; 

difficulties or delays in reaching an agreement with a contract research organization, and clinical trial sites; 

delays in obtaining required institutional review board approval for each trial site; 

data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of a NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere; 

delays or difficulties in recruiting suitable patients to participate in clinical trials; 

delays in manufacturing or delivering products and materials to clinical trial sites; 

delays or difficulties caused by lack of patient adherence to treatment or post-treatment follow-up; 

delays caused by patients dropping out of a trial and the need for recruiting additional patients; and 

delays caused by clinical sites dropping out of the trial and the time required to recruit a new site. 

Any of these delays or difficulties could cause
us to be delayed in obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities, if at all, or allow us to obtain approval for specific indications
or patient populations that are not as broad as currently targeted. In addition, such delays or difficulties may cause our development
costs or our time to bring our product candidates to market to increase, may weaken our competitive positioning in the market and may
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

37 

We cannot predict if or when we will receive
regulatory approval to commercialize a therapeutic product candidate. 

We cannot commercialize a therapeutic product
candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or a state regulating authority, have reviewed and approved the
product candidate. Even if our therapeutic product candidates demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, regulatory agencies
may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, and we may not be able to obtain timely regulatory approval. We may never
be able to receive regulatory approval for our therapeutic product candidates at all. Additional delays may result if an FDA advisory
committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or
rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency
policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process. Regulatory agencies may also approve a product
candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies.
In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization
of our product candidates. Delays or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. 

Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a
therapeutic product candidate, we will remain subject to extensive regulatory scrutiny. 

Even if we obtain regulatory approval in the United
States for our therapeutic product candidates, the FDA and other appropriate regulatory agencies may still impose significant restrictions
or delays, including restriction of patient population or indications or additional costly studies. Any changes to the approved product
or its labeling or manufacturing process would require FDA approval. Any advertisements or promotions must comply with FDA regulations
and are subject to FDA review as well as state and federal laws. Drug product manufacturers are subject to continual review and inspection
by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practice standards. If the FDA or other regulatory
authority finds previously undiscovered compliance issues with products, such as unanticipated adverse effects or issues with the manufacturing
facility, the FDA or other regulatory authority may: 

issue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of law; 

seek an injunction; 

impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; 

suspend or withdraw regulatory approval; 

suspend currently ongoing clinical trials; 

refuse any pending applications; 

seize product; or 

prohibit us from entering into beneficial or necessary contracts such as supply or government contracts. 

38 

Any government investigation of alleged violations
of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, could result in litigation and litigation-related expense
and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize
our therapeutic product candidates and generate revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. 

In addition, even if we obtain regulatory approvals,
the timing or scope of any approvals may prohibit or reduce our ability to commercialize our therapeutic product candidates successfully.
For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop
competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory approval that we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions
or post-approval commitments that render our products not commercially viable. For example, regulatory authorities may approve our therapeutic
product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our therapeutic
product candidates, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve our therapeutic
product candidates with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization
of that indication. Further, the FDA may place conditions on approvals including potential requirements or risk management plans and the
requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes
a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required.
A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution
methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial
promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of our therapeutic product candidates. Moreover, product approvals may be withdrawn
for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. Any of the foregoing
scenarios could materially harm the commercial success of our product candidates and have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition. 

We may fail to obtain orphan drug status for
our therapeutic product candidates. 

We intend to seek orphan drug status from the
FDA for those anti-cancer therapeutic product candidates we are presently developing to the extent such product candidates are eligible
for orphan drug status under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983. The orphan drug status gives the manufacturer specific financial incentives
to develop a pharmacological agent. If a product that has an orphan drug designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease for
which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other
applications to market the same medication for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Failure to
obtain an orphan drug designation for our product candidates may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. 

Any of our therapeutic product candidates may
cause adverse effects or have properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any specific indications
or market acceptance. 

Adverse events caused by our therapeutic product
candidates could cause interruptions, delays or the halting of our clinical trials. If adverse effects are observed in any clinical trials
for our therapeutic product candidates, we may be unable to obtain timely, or any, regulatory approval of our therapeutic product candidates.
Adverse effects caused by our therapeutic product candidates could also subject us to litigation and liability, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

In addition, if any of our therapeutic product
candidates are approved for commercialization and are found to cause serious or unpredicted side effects, serious consequences may result,
including but not limited to, the withdrawal of marketing approval by regulatory authorities, restrictions on distribution by regulatory
authorities, the need to conduct additional clinical trials, litigation and potential liability for personal injury to patients and damage
to our reputation. Furthermore, our ability to achieve and maintain profitability may be permanently impaired. Any of these events could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

39 

Our dietary supplements are subject to government
regulation, both in the United States and internationally, which could increase our costs significantly and limit or prevent the sale
of our dietary supplements. 

The manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising,
promotion, distribution and sale of Cannabics SR, and any other dietary supplements that we may develop and commercialize, is subject
to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the United States and other countries, including the FDA and Federal
Trade Commission in the United States, and the Ministry of Health in Israel. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements may
result in various types of penalties or fines. These include injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines and criminal
prosecutions. Individual states also regulate dietary supplements. A U.S. state may interpret claims or products presumptively valid under
federal law as illegal under that state s regulations. In markets outside the United States, we will likely be required to obtain
approvals, licenses, or certifications from a country s ministry of health or comparable agency, as well as labeling and packaging
regulations, all of which vary from country to country. Approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of products or may
be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients. Any of these government agencies, as well as legislative bodies,
can change existing regulations, or impose new ones, or could take aggressive measures, causing or contributing to a variety of negative
consequences, including: 

requirements for the reformulation of certain or all products to meet new standards; 

the recall or discontinuance of certain or all products; 

additional record keeping; 

expanded documentation of the properties of certain or all products; 

expanded or different labeling; 

adverse event tracking and reporting; and 

additional scientific substantiation. 

Any or all of these requirements could have a
material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change or that such
regulatory environment, or any specific action taken against us, will not result in a material adverse effect on us. 

Changes in legislation or regulation in the
health care systems in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may affect us. 

Our ability to successfully commercialize our
cannabinoid-based products may depend on how the healthcare systems of the United States, the European Union and other governments provide
coverage or reimbursement. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country, and include
both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required
to produce clinical data, which may involve one or more clinical trials, that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products to other
available therapies. We may not obtain international reimbursement or pricing approvals in a timely manner, if at all. Our failure to
receive international reimbursement or pricing approvals would negatively impact market acceptance of our products in the international
markets in which those approvals are sought. 

We believe that future reimbursement may be subject
to increased restrictions in the United States, the European Union and in other international markets. There is increasing pressure by
governments worldwide to contain health care costs by limiting both the coverage and the level of reimbursement for therapeutic products
and by refusing, in some cases, to provide any coverage for products that have not been approved by the relevant regulatory agency. Future
legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payers may adversely affect the demand for our product candidates currently
under development and limit our ability to sell our product candidates on a profitable basis. In addition, third party payers continually
attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare by challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and services. If reimbursement
for our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, market acceptance of our
products candidates will be impaired and future revenues, if any, will be adversely affected. 

40 

Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 

We rely and expect to continue to rely heavily
on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including
failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such studies and trials. 

We do not have in-house research facilities and,
as a consequence, we must currently rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. We expect to continue to rely heavily on third
parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators
and others to conduct our clinical trials. Our agreements with these third parties generally allow the third party to terminate our agreement
with them at any time. If we are required to enter into alternative arrangements because of any such termination, the introduction of
our product candidates to market could be delayed. 

Our reliance on third parties for research and
development will reduce our control over such activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. Likewise, our reliance on third
parties whom we do not control does not relieve us of our responsibility to comply with regulatory requirements to use Current Good Clinical
Practice standards when conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials in order to ensure that data and reported results
are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We are also required
to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database of regulatory
agencies within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. 

The third parties on whom we rely may also have
relationships with other entities, some of whom may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual
duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with the requirements of a regulatory agency or our stated
protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not
be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates. 

Collaboration agreements that we may enter
into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our diagnostics and therapeutic
product candidates. 

We may enter into collaboration agreements with
pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology institutions for the development or commercialization of our cannabinoid-based diagnostics
and therapeutic product candidates, which agreements may contain provisions based upon, among other things, the merits of retaining certain
rights. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and in negotiating agreements at acceptable terms, if
at all. We may not be successful in our efforts to enter, implement and maintain collaboration agreements. Disagreements stemming from
collaboration agreements concerning development, intellectual property, regulatory or commercialization matters can lead to delays and,
in some cases, termination of our collaboration agreements or otherwise result in the potentially significant costs and fees in seeking
to enforce or protect our rights, if any. Any such disagreements can be difficult if, in fact, neither of the parties has final decision-making
authority. The resulting outcome of any disputes or disagreements would in all likelihood adversely affect our business. 

Data provided by collaborators and others upon
which we rely that has not been independently verified could turn out to be false, misleading, or incomplete. 

We rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and
collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical trials, and our business. If
such third parties provide inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data, our business, prospects, and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected. 

41 

Our business model is substantially dependent
on third party licensees to market and sell our products, which will subject us to a number of risks. 

We depend on third party licensees to sell, market,
and service our products and current and future products in our intended markets. We are subject to a number of risks associated with
reliance upon third party licensees, including: 

lack of day-to-day control over the activities of licensees; 

third party licensees may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our current and future products to our level of expectations; 

third party licensees may terminate their arrangements with us on limited or no notice or may change the terms of these arrangements in a manner unfavorable to us; and 

disagreements with our future licensees could result in costly and time-consuming litigation or arbitration which we could be required to conduct in jurisdictions with which we are not familiar. 

If we fail to establish and maintain satisfactory
relationships with our future third party licensees, our revenue and market share may not grow as anticipated, and we could be subject
to unexpected costs which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. 

Risks Related To Operating In Israel 

Failure to secure the necessary Israeli licenses
to use cannabis for medical research could limit our ability to execute our research and development activities, delay the launch of our
products and adversely affect the results of our business operations. 

To date, we have only conducted our research in
Israel and, in fact, have limited our operations to Israel. The biotechnologies that we are developing contain cannabis, a controlled
substance as defined in the Israeli Dangerous Drugs Ordinance [New Version], 5733 - 1973. In Israel, licenses to cultivate, possess
and to use cannabis for medical research are granted by the Ministry of Health, Israel Medical Cannabis Unit IMCU ), on
an ad hoc basis. We have obtained all IMCU licenses that are necessary for us to carry out our research. Even though we have an
established track record of successfully obtaining the requisite licenses as required, there can be no assurance that we will continue
to be able to secure licenses in the future. If we fail to comply with Israeli rules and regulations related to the licensing of cannabis,
we may not be able to research and develop our product candidates as we intend or at all. 

We may become subject to claims for remuneration
or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees, which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business. 

A significant portion of our intellectual property
has been developed by our Israeli employees in the course of their employment for us. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967 (the Israeli
Patent Law ), inventions conceived of by an employee during the term and as part of the scope of his or her employment with a company
are regarded as service inventions, which belong to the employer, absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer
giving the employee service invention rights. The Israeli Patent Law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer
and an employee, the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee (the C R Committee ), a body constituted under the
Israeli Patent Law, shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her inventions. The C R Committee
(decisions of which have been upheld by the Israeli Supreme Court) has held that employees may be entitled to remuneration for their service
inventions despite having specifically waived any such rights. Further, the C R Committee has not yet set specific guidelines regarding
the method for calculating this remuneration or the criteria or circumstances under which an employee s waiver of his or her right
to remuneration will be disregarded. We generally enter into intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees pursuant to
which such employees assign to us all rights to any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement with us. Although
our employees have agreed to assign to us service invention rights and have specifically waived their right to receive any special remuneration
for such assignment beyond their regular salary and benefits, we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for assigned
inventions. As a consequence of such claims, we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current or former
employees, or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect our business. 

42 

We expect that our results of operations will
be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because a substantial portion of our anticipated revenue will be generated in U.S.
dollars and Euros while a significant portion of our expenses will be incurred in New Israeli Shekels. 

We expect a substantial portion of our revenue
will be generated in U.S. dollars and Euros, while a significant portion of our expenses, principally salaries and related personnel expenses,
is paid in New Israeli Shekels, or NIS. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that the rate of inflation in Israel will exceed the rate
of devaluation of the NIS in relation to the Euro or the U.S. dollar, or that the timing of this devaluation will lag behind inflation
in Israel. Because inflation has the effect of increasing the U.S. dollar and Euro costs of our operations, it would therefore have an
adverse effect on our dollar-measured results of operations. The value of the NIS, against the Euro, the U.S. dollar, and other currencies
may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in Israel s political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation
of the NIS may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and financial condition. Fluctuations in the NIS exchange rate,
or even the appearance of instability in such exchange rate, could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. 

We may not be able to enforce covenants not-to-compete
under current Israeli law. 

We have non-competition agreements with most of
our employees, all of which are governed by Israeli law. These agreements generally prohibit our employees from competing with us or working
for our competitors for a specified period following termination of their employment. However, Israeli courts are reluctant to enforce
non-compete undertakings of former employees and tend, if at all, to enforce those provisions for relatively brief periods of time in
restricted geographical areas and only when the employee has unique value specific to that employer s business and not just regarding
the professional development of the employee. Any such inability to enforce non-compete covenants may cause us to lose any competitive
advantage arising from confidential information known to such former employees. 

It may be difficult for investors in the United
States to enforce any judgments obtained against us or some of our directors or officers. 

The majority of our assets are located outside
the United States. In addition, certain of our officers are nationals or residents of countries other than the United States, and all
or a substantial portion of such persons assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors
to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against us or any of our non-U.S. officers, including judgments predicated
upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. It may also be difficult to assert
claims under United States securities law in actions originally instituted outside of the United States. Moreover, Israeli courts may
refuse to hear a United States securities law claim because Israeli courts may not be the most appropriate forums in which to bring such
a claim. Even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law, and not U.S. law, is applicable to the claim.
Further, if U.S. law is found to be applicable, certain content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming
and costly process, and certain matters of procedure would still be governed by Israeli law. Consequently, our investors may be effectively
prevented from pursuing remedies under U.S. federal and state securities laws against us or any of our non-U.S. directors or officers. 

If there are significant shifts in the political,
economic and military conditions in Israel and its neighbors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business relationships and
profitability. 

All of our research facilities and certain of
our key personnel are located in Israel. Our business is directly affected by the political, economic and military conditions in Israel
and its neighbors. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and
its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has caused security and economic problems in Israel. Although
Israel has entered into peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and various agreements with the Palestinian Authority, there has been a
marked increase in violence, civil unrest and hostility, including armed clashes, between the State of Israel and the Palestinians since
September 2000. The establishment in 2006 of a government in the Gaza Strip by representatives of the Hamas militant group has created
heightened unrest and uncertainty in the region. In mid-2006, Israel engaged in an armed conflict with Hezbollah, a Shiite Islamist militia
group based in Lebanon, and in June 2007, there was an escalation in violence in the Gaza Strip. From December 2008 through January 2009
and again in November and December 2012, Israel engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas, which involved missile strikes against civilian
targets in various parts of Israel and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. In July 2014, Israel launched an additional
operation against Hamas operatives in the Gaza strip in response to Palestinian groups launching rockets at Israel. Recent political uprisings
and social unrest in Syria are affecting its political stability, which has led to the deterioration of the political relationship between
Syria and Israel and have raised new concerns regarding security in the region and the potential for armed conflict. Similar civil unrest
and political turbulence is currently ongoing in many countries in the region. The continued political instability and hostilities between
Israel and its neighbors and any future armed conflict, terrorist activity or political instability in the region could adversely affect
our operations in Israel and adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock. In addition, several countries restrict
doing business with Israel and Israeli companies have been and are today subjected to economic boycotts. The interruption or curtailment
of trade between Israel and its present trading partners could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Stock 

There can be no assurance of an active, liquid
and orderly trading market for our common stock or that investors will be able to sell their shares of common stock. 

At present, our common stock is quoted on the
OTCQB tier of the marketplace maintained by OTC Markets Group Inc., under the symbol CNBX. There is only a limited, liquid
public trading market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a liquid market for our common stock will continue. Market
liquidity will depend on the perception of our business and any steps that our management might take to bring public awareness of our
business to the investing public within the parameters of the federal securities laws. There is no assurance that any such awareness will
be generated or sustained. Therefore, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price paid by investors
equal to or greater than their initial investment in our common stock. Moreover, holders of our common stock may not find purchasers for
their shares should they to decide to sell the common stock held by them at any particular time if ever. Our common stock should be purchased
only by investors who have no immediate need for liquidity in their investment and who can hold our common stock, possibly for a prolonged
period of time. 

The price of our common stock is volatile,
and the value of your investment could decline. 

The market price of our common stock has been
highly volatile. Between September 1 st , 2023, and August 31 st , 2024, the sales price of our stock on the OTCQB ranged
from a low of 0.0055 per share to a high of .098 per share. Accordingly, it is difficult to forecast the future performance of our common
stock. The market price of our common stock may be higher or lower than the price you pay, depending on many factors, some of which are
beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your
investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following: 

technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors; 

regulatory developments at the federal, state or local level; 

additions or departures of key personnel; 

our ability to execute our business plan; 

operating results that fall below expectations; 

loss of any strategic relationship; 

industry developments; 

economic, political and other external factors; and 

period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results. 

The stock market generally and in particular,
the market for stocks of biotechnology companies with lower market capitalizations, like us, have from time to time experienced, and likely
will again experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company.
The trading price of our common stock might decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry, even if these events
do not directly affect us. 

44 

Periods of volatility in the market price of a
company s securities have often been followed by securities class action litigation against that company. If our stock price continues
to be volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management s
attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition. 

We may never pay any dividends to our shareholders. 

We currently intend to retain any future earnings
for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future,
but will review this policy as circumstances dictate. The declaration and payment of all future dividends, if any, will be at the sole
discretion of our board of directors, which retains the right to change our dividend policy at any time. Consequently, our stockholders
must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains
on their investment. 

Our principal stockholders and management own
a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval. 

As of August 31, 2024, Cannabics Inc., a Delaware
corporation owns 3.2 of our common stock. Our two Directors are also holders of shares in Cannabics Inc., and therefore have substantial
influence over it. Accordingly, the Company (and our management) may be able to control the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes
concerning the election of directors, amendment of our organizational documents, approval of mergers, sales of assets and other significant
corporate transactions. 

We may issue shares of preferred stock with
greater rights than our common stock, which may entrench management and result in dilution of our stockholders' investment. 

Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance
of up to 900 million shares of preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per share. The authorized but unissued preferred stock may be issued
by our board of directors from time to time on any number of occasions, without stockholder approval, as one or more separate series of
shares comprised of any number of the authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, designated by resolution of our board of directors
stating the name and number of shares of each series and setting forth separately for such series the relative rights, privileges and
preferences thereof, including, if any, the: (i) rate of dividends payable thereon; (ii) price, terms and conditions of redemption; (iii)
voluntary and involuntary liquidation preferences; (iv) provisions of a sinking fund for redemption or repurchase; (v) terms of conversion
to common stock, including conversion price, and (vi) voting rights. Such preferred stock may enable our board of directors to hinder
or discourage any attempt to gain control of the Company by a merger, tender offer at a control premium price, proxy contest or otherwise.
Consequently, the preferred stock could entrench our management. The market price of our common stock could be depressed by the existence
of the preferred stock. 

Nevada law and certain provisions of our Articles
of Incorporation and bylaws may discourage mergers and other transactions. 

Provisions of Nevada law, such as its business
combination statute, and certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult for someone to acquire
control of the Company and limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. These provisions
may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and could delay or prevent someone from acquiring our business.
The provisions could be beneficial to our management and the board of directors in a hostile tender offer, and could have an adverse impact
on stockholders who might want to participate in such tender offer, or who might want to replace some or all of the members of the board
of directors. 

45 

Our common stock may be subject to penny stock
rules, which may make it more difficult for our investors to sell their common stock. 

Our common stock is presently considered to be
a "penny stock" and is subject to SEC rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which such shares may
be publicly traded, and regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny stocks." Penny stocks generally
are equity securities with a price of less than 5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted
on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by
the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from
the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny
stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation
of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock
held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock, the
broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's
written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the
secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules which may increase the difficulty investors may experience
in attempting to liquidate such securities. These requirements could also hamper our ability to raise funds in the primary market for
our shares of common stock. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 

None. 

As security for its obligation under a property
lease agreement, credit cards, the Company s subsidiary provided a bank guarantee in the amount of 5,000. 

Item 1C. Cybersecurity 

We recognize the critical
importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. We currently have security measures in place to protect our clients, customers,
employees, and vendor information and prevent data loss and other security breaches. We also only use third party software for accounting,
billing and payroll that have successful SOC 1 type 2 compliance. Both management and the Board are actively involved in the continuous
assessment of risks from cybersecurity threats, including prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents.
Our current cybersecurity risk assessment program consists of an annual review of our risks and policies. The program outlines governance,
policies and procedures, and technology we use to oversee and identify risks from cybersecurity threats. 

Our CEO is responsible
for overseeing our business operations and are responsible for day-to-day assessment and management of risks from cybersecurity threats,
including the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. We also use the services of an outside consulting
firm to monitor activity and advise the company of cybersecurity protocols. 

We routinely undertake activities to prevent,
detect, and minimize the effects of cybersecurity incidents, including an annual risk review, policy reviews and revisions. In addition,
we maintain business continuity, contingency, and recovery plans for use in the event of a cybersecurity incident by the administering
of local and cloud based back up of files. and emails. 

 We engaged and used the advice of a third-party
consultant to help us assess and identify risks from cybersecurity threats, including the threat of a cybersecurity incident, and manage
our risk assessment program. Among other things, these providers have recommended periodic evaluations of the work stations. 

46 

We have multiple controls in place in order to
prevent breaches, some of these controls include: 

a. 
 FMA/2FA, this is our first AND most important first line of defense, no
one should have MFA bypassed or disabled, with no exceptions. 

b. 
 Email Banner for external emails. This banner assists us to identify any
phishing / impersonation email and cannot be bypassed. 

c. 
 Conditional Access Policy (CAP): Rejects connections to Exchange Online
from un-authorized countries. We are further enhancing this control by implementing ACL's (access lists) in our CRM and ERP systems and
any other mission critical platform. ALL platforms should have MFA enforced, any platform not supporting MFA in 2024 is deemed high-risk
and immediately replaced as it is obsolete and poses high-risk to the Company. 

As of the date of this
report, no cybersecurity incident (or aggregation of incidents) or cybersecurity threat has materially affected our results of operations
or financial condition. However, an actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation and cause damage to our relationships,
, as well as prevent us from attracting new clients / customers. and / or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other
actions or liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. We currently do not
carry a cyber liability insurance policy, but are evaluating whether to acquire one to mitigate any financial impact of a cybersecurity
breach.

PART II 

Item 5. Market For Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

Market Information. 

We have one class of securities, Common Voting
Equity Shares ("Common Stock"). The holders of our common stock have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available
if and when declared by our Board of Directors and are entitled to share pro-rata in all of our available assets for distribution to holders
of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs; there are no preemptive, subscription or conversion rights
and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights. 

Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin
Board OTCQB under the symbol "CNBX". As of November 20, 2024, the Company s common stock was held by 58
shareholders of record, which does not include shares that are held in street or nominee name. 

Shareholders 

Our shares of common stock are issued in registered
form. The registrar and transfer agent for our shares of common stock is ClearTrust LLC, 16540 Pointe Village Dr. Suite 210, Lutz, FL
33558; (813) 235-4490. 

On Nov 20th, 2024, the shareholders' list of our
shares of common stock showed 58 registered holders of our shares of common stock and 31,111,352 shares of common stock outstanding. The
number of record holders was determined from the records of our transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of shares of common
stock whose shares are held in the names of various security brokers, dealers, and registered clearing agencies. 

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

During the years ended August 31, 2024, and August
31, 2023, there were no repurchases of the Company s common stock by the Company. 

Dividend Policy 

Our board of directors may declare and pay dividends
on outstanding shares of common stock out of funds legally available there for in our sole discretion; however, to date no dividends have
been declared or paid on common stock. 

Indemnification of Directors and Officers 

Nevada Corporation Law allows for the indemnification
of officers, directors, and any corporate agents in terms sufficiently broad to indemnify such persons under certain circumstances for
liabilities, including reimbursement for expenses, incurred arising under the 1933 Act. The Bylaws of the Company provide that the Company
will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law and such right to indemnification will
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company and will inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors
and Consultants; provided, however, that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company will not be obligated
to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred will include the right to be paid by
the Company the expenses (including attorney s fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition. 

The Company may, to the extent authorized from
time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of
the Company similar to those conferred to directors and officers of the Company. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement
of expenses are subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act to the extent applicable. 

Furthermore, the Company may maintain insurance,
at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or another company against any expense,
liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the Nevada General Corporation Law.

Anti-Takeover Provisions Under the Nevada Revised Statutes 

Certain provisions of Nevada law, and our Articles
of Incorporation and our Bylaws, each as amended and subject, where applicable as described below, our opting out of certain provisions
of Nevada law, contain provisions that could make the following transactions more difficult: acquisition of us by means of a tender offer;
acquisition of us by means of a proxy contest or otherwise; or removal of our incumbent officers and directors. It is possible that these
provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their
best interest or in our best interests, including transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for our shares. 

These provisions, summarized below, are expected
to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking
to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential
ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages
of discouraging these proposals because negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 

None. 

Penny Stock Regulation 

Our shares must comply with the Penny Stock Reform
Act of 1990, which may potentially decrease our shareholders ability to easily transfer their shares. Broker-dealer practices in
connection with transactions in "penny stocks" are regulated. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less
than 5.00. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules,
to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market.
The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer
and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's
account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer make a special
written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to
the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for
a stock that must comply with the penny stock rules. Since our shares must comply with such penny stock rules, our shareholders will in
all likelihood find it more difficult to sell their securities.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION
WITH OUR AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THAT APPEAR ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION CONTAINS
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT REFLECT OUR PLANS, ESTIMATES AND BELIEFS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED
IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE
IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements made in this report may constitute
 forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events . These forward-looking statements
involve known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of the
Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
In some cases you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, potential, 
 continue, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, 
 estimates, and similar expressions. These statements are based on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions and
are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Although we believe that the expectations reflected-in the forward-looking statements
are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. These forward-looking statements
are made as of the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of
new information, future events, or otherwise, other than as required by law. In light of these assumptions, risks, and uncertainties,
the forward-looking events discussed in this report might not occur and actual results and events may vary significantly from those discussed
in the forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada,
on September 15, 2004, as Thrust Energy Corp. On May 5, 2011, the Company changed its name to American Mining Company. Our principal offices
are in Bethesda, Maryland. On May 21st, 2014 the Company changed its name to its current CNBX Pharmaceuticals Inc. 

The Company was originally engaged in the exploration,
development and production of oil and gas projects within North America, but was unable to operate profitably. In May 2011, the Company
suspended its oil and gas operations and changed its business to toll milling and refining and mine development. As of April 2014, the
Company has changed its course of business to Biotechnology Pharmaceutical development. As such, the Company has divested itself of its
former mining properties. 

Financing 

We will require additional financing to implement
our business plan, which may include joint venture projects and debt or equity financings. The nature of this enterprise and lack of positive
cash flow places debt financing beyond the credit-worthiness required by most banks or typical investors of corporate debt until such
time as an economically viable profits and losses can be demonstrated. Therefore, any debt financing of our activities may be costly and
result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. 

Future financing through equity investments is
likely to be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, the terms of securities we may issue in future capital transactions may be more
favorable for our new investors. Newly issued securities may include preferences, superior voting rights, and the issuance of warrants
or other derivative securities, which may have additional dilutive effects. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future
capital and financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, and other costs. We may also be required to recognize
non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact
our financial condition. 

50 

Our ability to obtain needed financing may be
impaired by such factors as the capital markets, both generally and specifically in the bio-pharma industry, and the fact that we have
not been profitable to date, which could impact the availability or cost of future financings. If the amount of capital we are able to
raise from financing activities, together with our revenue from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, even to the
extent that we reduce our operations accordingly, we may be required to cease operations. 

There is no assurance that we will be able to
obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future financing. If we are
unable to secure additional funding, we may cease or suspend operations. We have no plans, arrangements or contingencies in place in the
event that we cease operations.

Going Concern 

Our independent auditors included an explanatory
paragraph in their report on the accompanying consolidated financial statements regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a
going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure
by our independent auditors. 

Our financial statements have been prepared on
a going concern basis, which assumes the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary
financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The outcome
of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a
going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amount and classification of assets and liabilities that
may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

There is no assurance that our operations will
be profitable. The Company has conducted private placements of its common stock, which have generated funds to satisfy the initial cash
requirements of its planned Nevada exploration ventures. Our continued existence and plans for future growth depend on our ability to
obtain the additional capital necessary to operate either through the generation of revenue or the issuance of additional debt or equity. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CNBX Pharmaceuticals
Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CNBX
Pharmaceuticals Inc. the Company as of August 31, 2023, and 2022 and the related statements of operations, changes in
stockholders' deficit and cash flows, for each of the years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively
referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2023, and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the periods ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has incurred significant
losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

F- 1 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or are required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Going concern- refer to note 1 of the financial statements 

Critical audit matter description 

The Company raised a substantial doubt about the
entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The financial statements for the years under audit have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. See the explanatory paragraph of the opinion paragraph. 

How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit 

We evaluated whether there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We obtained information about management's plans that are intended to mitigate the effect of such conditions or events, and assess the likelihood that such plans can be effectively implemented. 

We added explanatory paragraph to the audit report. 

Convertible Loan-refer to note 6 of the financial
Statements 

Critical audit matter description 

In order to raise funds, the company entered into
a Securities Purchase Agreement SPA with an institutional investor for a private placement of senior secured convertible
notes totaling up to an aggregate of 2,750,000 in 2020. As of the balance sheet date, the balance of the convertible loan is 1,343,584. 

At this time a portion of the loan has been converted
to common shares. While the loan is presented on the books as a liability, the company expects that the entire amount will be converted
to share capital. If the lender were to request payment in kind the company would possibly not have sufficient to repay the loan, therefore
we consider this a critical audit matter. 

How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit 

We evaluated whether it is reasonable to expect the loan to be converted to share capital or if the company will be required to pay cash

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

 As of August 31, 2024 

for the year ended August 31, 2024 and has incurred cumulative losses since
inception of . These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

The Company s continuation as a going concern
is dependent upon its ability to generate revenues, its ability to continue to raise investment capital, and implementing its business
plan. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. 

These financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management believes that actions presently being
taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.

The FASB has issued ASC 740 Income Taxes .
ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements. This standard
requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the
technical merits of the position. 

If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met,
a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. 

As a result of the implementation of this standard,

No provision for income tax was made for the period
from September 15, 2004 (Inception) to August 31, 2023, as the Company had cumulative operating losses. For the years ended August 31,
2024, and 2023, the Company incurred net losses for tax purposes of and , respectively. Under U.S. tax laws, subject
to certain limitations, carry forward tax losses expire 20 years after the year in which incurred. In the case of the Company, subject
to potential limitations in accordance with the relevant law, the net loss carry forward will expire in the years 2032 through 2044. 

Corporate taxation in Israel: 

The Subsidiary is taxed in accordance with Israeli

As of August 31, 2024, the Subsidiary has an accumulated
tax loss carry forward of approximately (as of August 31, 2023, approximately ). Under the Israeli tax laws, carry

Provision for income tax 

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for tax purposes. The components of the net deferred income tax assets are approximately as follows:

Net deferred income tax assets 

The amount taken into income as deferred income
tax assets must reflect that portion of the income tax loss carry forwards that is more likely than not to be realized from future operations.
The Company has established a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets because of a lack of sufficient positive evidence
to support its realization. The valuation allowance increased by 
 by and decreased 
 for the years ended August 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

No provision for income taxes has been provided
in these financial statements due to the net loss for the years ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. At August 31, 2024, the Company has net
operating loss carry forwards of approximately which expire commencing 2044. The potential tax benefit of these losses may
be limited due to certain change in ownership provisions under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code IRS and similar
state provisions. 

IRS Section 382 places limitations (the Section
382 Limitation on the amount of taxable income which can be offset by net operating loss carry forwards after a change in control
(generally greater than 50 change in ownership) of a loss corporation. Generally, after a change in control, a loss corporation cannot
deduct operating loss carry forwards in excess of the Section 382 Limitation. Due to these change in ownership provisions,
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization
against taxable income in future periods. The Company has not concluded its analysis of Section 382 through August 31, 2024, but believes
the provisions will not limit the availability of losses to offset future income. 

The Company is subject to income taxes in the
U.S. federal jurisdiction and is subject to examination for a period of three years for current filings and indefinitely for any delinquent
filings. The tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of related tax laws and regulations and require significant
judgment to apply. The Company estimates that the amount of penalties, if any, will not have a material effect on the results of operations,
cash flows or financial position. No provisions have been made in the financial statements for such penalties, if any.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In accordance
with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer., of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Officers assessed, reviewed and determined
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as to this annual filing. Based on that evaluation, The
Board accepted and ratified the findings of the management that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as of August 31,
2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer s principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer s board of directors, management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that our degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s
internal controls over financial reporting as of August 1, 2024, based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework
(COSO 2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission. On the basis of that assessment, management
determined that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of that date. 

55 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

Since our previous annual report, there were no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended August 31, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Our disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial
reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain
assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error will not occur or that all control issues and instances of inaccurate entries,
if any, within the Company have been detected. 

Item 9B. Other Information 

During
the quarter ended August 31, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1
