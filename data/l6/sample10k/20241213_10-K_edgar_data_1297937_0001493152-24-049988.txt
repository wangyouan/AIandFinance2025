its current name Parks! America and its current stock symbol PRKA. Parks! America is domiciled in the state
of Nevada and its headquarters is in Pine Mountain, Georgia. The Company s shares trade on the OTCPink. 

The
Company maintains a website at www.animalsafari.com. Information included on the Company s website is not incorporated by reference
into this Form 10-K. 

Wild
Animal Safari, Inc. Our Georgia Park 

On
June 13, 2005, Wild Animal Georgia acquired our Georgia Park. Our Georgia Park is situated in Pine Mountain, Georgia within a
200-acre portion of a 500-acre property, located approximately 75 miles southwest of Atlanta. Our Georgia Park features a three-mile
drive-through animal viewing area that opened in 1991. It is home to approximately 600 animals, birds and reptiles, comprised of approximately
55 species. Most of the animals roam wild in a natural habitat. Visitors can observe, photograph and feed the animals along the paved
road that runs through the drive-through section of our Georgia Park s natural habitat area. Some animals are contained in special
fenced-in exhibit areas within the drive-through section of our Georgia Park, while others are in a more traditional zoo-like walk through
section of the park, the Walkabout Adventure Zoo. 

Wild
Animal, Inc. Our Missouri Park 

On
March 5, 2008, Wild Animal Missouri acquired our Missouri Park. Our Missouri Park is situated in Strafford, Missouri on 255 acres
of land, located approximately 15 miles east of Springfield and approximately 45 miles northeast of Branson. Our Missouri Park features
a five-mile drive-through wild animal viewing area that opened in 1971. It is home to approximately 300 animals, birds and reptiles,
comprised of approximately 65 species. Most of the animals roam wild in a natural habitat. Visitors can observe, photograph and feed
the animals along the paved road that runs through the drive-through section of our Missouri Park s natural habitat area. Some
animals are contained in special fenced-in exhibit areas within the drive-through section of our Missouri Park, while others are in a
more traditional zoo-like walk through section of the park, the Walkabout Adventure Zoo. 

4 

Aggieland-Parks,
Inc. Our Texas Park 

On
April 27, 2020, Aggieland Wild Animal Texas acquired our Texas Park. Our Texas Park is situated on 250 acres of a 450-acre property,
located approximately 25 miles northeast of Bryan/College Station, Texas and 120 miles northwest of downtown Houston. Our Texas Park
features a two-and-a-half mile drive-through animal viewing area that opened in 2019. It is home to approximately 600 animals, birds
and reptiles, comprised of approximately 80 species. Most of the animals roam wild throughout a natural habitat. Visitors can observe,
photograph and feed the animals along a crushed-gravel road that runs through the drive-through section of our Texas Park s natural
habitat area. Some animals are contained in special fenced-in exhibit areas within the drive-through section of our Texas Park, while
others are in a more traditional zoo-like walk through section of the park, the Walkabout Adventure Zoo. 

Animal
Park Operations 

Park
revenues are primarily derived from admission fees, sales of animal food, animal encounters, vehicle rentals, gift shop and specialty
item sales, and food and beverage sales. 

In
addition to the animal environments, each of our parks contains a gift shop, a restaurant or concessions areas, and picnic areas. We
sell food and beverages in our restaurants or concession areas, and a variety of items in our gift shops, including shirts, hats, plush,
educational books, toys and novelty items, many of which are animal themed. 

Most
of the animals at each of our parks have been born on-site or domestically acquired. We rarely import animals and have not imported any
animals in the past 15 years. Auctions and sales of animals across the United States occur often and we may acquire animals in these
auctions if we see an opportunity to enhance the animal population at our parks. As a result of natural breeding, animal populations
at our parks tend to grow over time. Periodically, we sell surplus animals, and the proceeds are recorded as revenue. The periodic acquisition
and sale of animals is also part of our herd and genetic management program. From time-to-time, we may also relocate animals between
our parks as part of this program. Each park is subject to routine inspection by federal and state agencies. Each park maintains a high
standard of animal care and has passed all recent inspections. 

Employees 

Our
Georgia Park has approximately 20 full-time employees and engages 24-40 additional part-time and seasonal employees. Our Missouri Park
has approximately 12 full-time employees and engages 8-12 additional part-time and seasonal employees. Our Texas Park has approximately
11 full-time employees and engages 15-20 additional part-time and seasonal employees. We have no collective bargaining agreements with
our employees and believe our relations with our employees are good. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors 
below for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied
by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Risk
Factors Relating to Our Business: 

Conditions
beyond our control, including natural disasters or extreme weather, could damage our properties and could adversely impact attendance
at our parks and result in decreased revenues. 

Natural
disasters, public heath crises, epidemics, pandemics, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, terrorist activities, power outages or other
events outside our control could disrupt our operations, impair critical systems, damage our properties or reduce attendance at our parks
or require temporary park closures. Damage to our properties could take a long time to repair and there is no guarantee that we would
have adequate insurance to cover the costs of repair or the expense of the interruption to our business. Furthermore, natural disasters
such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes or extreme weather events linked to climate change, may interrupt or impede access to our affected
properties or require evacuations and may cause attendance at our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period. For example,
during 2023, our Georgia park experienced extensive damage caused by a tornado. 

5 

The
occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot
predict the frequency, duration or severity of these activities and the effect that they may have on our business, financial condition
or results of operations. 

General
economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Our
business and operating results can be impacted by several macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and
spending levels, tax rates, unemployment, inflation, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, pandemics (such as the COVID-19
pandemic) and natural disasters, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), and credit market conditions. A general economic slowdown
or recession resulting in a decrease in discretionary spending could adversely affect the frequency with which guests choose to visit
our parks and the amount that our guests spend when they visit. Our ability to source supplies, materials and services at reasonable
costs and in a timely manner could be impacted by adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. 

The
Theme Park Industry is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively. 

The
theme park industry is highly competitive, highly fragmented, rapidly evolving, and subject to technological change and intense marketing
by providers with similar products. Callaway Gardens is located within five miles and a Great Wolf Resort is located within 10 miles
of our Georgia Park. The Wonders of Wildlife National Museum and Aquarium is located approximately within 20 miles from our Missouri
Park. Branson, Missouri is located just 45 minutes from our Missouri Park. Franklin Drive Thru Safari is located within 30 miles of our Texas Park.
Santa s Wonderland is located within 35 miles from our Texas Park. Many of our current competitors are significantly larger and
have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial, technical, operational, marketing and other resources and experience
than we have. In the event a competitor expends significant sales and marketing resources in one or several markets we may not be able
to compete successfully in such markets. If our competitors were to provide better and more cost effective products, our business could
be materially and adversely affected. 

We
face strong competition from numerous entertainment alternatives. 

In
addition to competing with other themed and amusement parks, our venues compete with other types of recreational venues and entertainment
alternatives, including but not limited to movies, sports attractions, vacation travel and video games. There can be no assurance that
we will successfully differentiate ourselves from these entertainment alternatives or that consumers will consider our entertainment
offerings to be more appealing than those of our competitors. 

The
suspension or termination of any of our business licenses may have a negative impact on our business. 

We
maintain a variety of business licenses issued by federal, state and local government agencies that are required to be renewed periodically.
We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in renewing all our licenses on a periodic basis. The suspension, termination or expiration
of one or more of these licenses could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profits. In addition, any changes to the
requirements for any of our licenses could affect our ability to maintain the licenses. 

Our
insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase. 

Companies
engaged in the theme park business may be sued for substantial damages in the event of an actual or alleged accident. An accident occurring
at our parks or at competing parks may reduce attendance, increase insurance premiums, and negatively impact our operating results. Our
properties contain drive-through, safari style animal parks, and there are inherent risks associated with allowing the public to interact
with animals. Although we carry liability insurance to cover this risk, there can be no assurance that our coverage will be adequate
to cover liabilities, or that we will be able to afford or obtain adequate coverage should a catastrophic incident occur. 

We
currently have 6.0 million of liability insurance per occurrence, which is capped at 10.0 million in aggregate. We will continue to
use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain policies of liability, fire and casualty insurance sufficient to provide reasonable coverage
for risks arising from accidents, fire, weather, other acts of God, and other potential casualties. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to obtain adequate levels of insurance to protect against legal actions and judgments in connection with accidents or other
disasters that may occur in our parks. 

6 

Our
ownership of real property subjects us to environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures
and liabilities. 

We
may be required to incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to discharges to air, water and land;
the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Under these and
other environmental requirements we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at
one of our properties. As an owner or operator, we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third party for property
damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination. Environmental laws
typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence
of the contaminants. The liability under environmental laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible
and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances
may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to
use our property. We are not currently aware of any material environmental risks regarding our properties. However, we may be required
to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards or to mitigate environmental risks in the future.

to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards or to mitigate environmental risks in the future. 

Increased
labor and employee benefit costs may negatively impact our results of operations. We also depend on a seasonal workforce, many of whom
are paid at or near minimum wage. 

Labor
is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors,
including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs, as well
as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits. Furthermore, our operations
are dependent in part on a seasonal workforce, many of whom are paid at or near minimum wage. We seek to manage seasonal wages and the
timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place for peak and low seasons; however, we may be unable to recruit
and hire sufficient personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, we cannot guarantee that material increases in the cost of securing
our workforce will not occur in the future. Increased state or federal minimum wage requirements, general wages or an inadequate workforce
could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 

Data
privacy regulation and our ability to comply could harm our business. 

We
(or third parties on our behalf) collect, store and use personal information and other customer data we receive through online ticket
sales, marketing, mailing lists, and guest reservations. There are multiple federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and protection
of personal information and data, and these laws and regulations continue to evolve. For example, many states have passed laws requiring
notification to customers when there is a security breach involving their personal data and multiple jurisdictions are considering legislation
that may impose liability if a business fails to properly safeguard personal information of its customers. Maintaining compliance with
applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs. We believe our cybersecurity measures are adequate. However,
if we were to experience a data breach, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or costly litigation. 

7 

Risk
Factors Relating to Our Common Stock: 

Our
Common Stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC and the trading market in our Common Stock is limited, which
makes transactions in our Common Stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our Common Stock. 

Our
common stock is considered a penny stock and the sale of our stock by you will be subject to the penny stock rules 
of the SEC. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers to take steps before making any penny stock trades in customer accounts. As
a result, the market for our shares could be illiquid and there could be delays in the trading of our stock, which would negatively affect
your ability to sell your shares and could negatively affect the trading price of your shares. 

We
have not historically paid dividends. 

As
of the date of this report, no cash dividends have been paid on our common stock. Any future determination as to the payment of dividends
on our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, operating and financial condition,
capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. The provisions of credit agreements, which we may enter
from time to time, may also restrict the declaration of dividends on our common stock. 

Our
rights plan may discourage potential acquirers of the Company. 

On
January 19, 2024, we adopted a rights plan (the Rights Plan ), which provides, among other things, that when specified events
occur, our stockholders will be entitled to purchase additional shares of our common stock. The Rights Plan will expire on January 18,
2025, unless earlier redeemed, exchanged or extended. The preferred stock purchase rights are triggered ten days after the date of a
public announcement that a person or group has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 10 or more of our
outstanding shares of common stock. The rights would cause significant dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company
on terms that are not approved by the Board. These provisions, either alone or in combination with each other, give the Board an ability
to influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the Company and could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a
change in control over us. 

ITEM

ITEM
1C. CYBERSECURITY 

While
we have never had a material cybersecurity incident that impacted our operations, we face various cyber and other security threats, including
attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and networks; employee threats; virtual and cyber threats to our directors,
officers, and employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts or other acts
of aggression. Our customers and vendors face similar threats. We utilize internal and external independent controls to monitor and mitigate
the risk of these threats. All our key business processes utilize third-party software platforms. We do not retain any sensitive customer
information outside of these systems. 

The
impact of potential cybersecurity threats is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or
capabilities, harm to individuals or property, damage to our reputation, loss of business, regulatory actions, and potential liability,
any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. These threats could
lead to losses of sensitive information or capabilities, harm to personnel, infrastructure, or products, and/or damage to our reputation
as well as our vendor s ability to perform on our contracts.

Overview 

Through
our wholly owned subsidiaries, we own and operate three regional safari parks and are in the business of acquiring, developing and operating
local and regional entertainment assets in the United States. Our wholly owned subsidiaries are Wild Animal Safari, Inc., a Georgia corporation Wild Animal Georgia ), Wild Animal, Inc., a Missouri corporation Wild Animal Missouri ),
and Aggieland-Parks, Inc., a Texas corporation Aggieland Wild Animal Texas ). Wild Animal Georgia owns
and operates the Wild Animal Safari park in Pine Mountain, Georgia (the Georgia Park ). Wild Animal Missouri owns
and operates the Wild Animal Safari park located in Strafford, Missouri (the Missouri Park ). Aggieland Wild Animal 
Texas owns and operates the Aggieland Wild Animal Safari park near Bryan/College Station, Texas (the Texas Park ). 

Our
parks are open year round, but experience increased seasonal attendance, typically beginning in the latter half of March through early
September. Combined third and fourth quarter park revenues were 61.4 and 60.4 of annual park revenues for our 2024 and 2023 fiscal
years, respectively. 

10 

The
table below outlines our annual net sales, reported and adjusted income before income taxes, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, and non-recurring items Adjusted EBITDA ), and net cash provided by operating activities for the last
five fiscal years. We believe attendance at our parks benefited starting in May 2020 through August 2022 from the COVID-19 pandemic which
drove an increase in demand for outdoor entertainment. Our park revenue remains above pre-pandemic levels, however, is down from the
high in our 2021 fiscal year. In our 2023 fiscal year park revenue was
negatively impacted by approximately 1.0 million at our Georgia Park from the March severe weather and tornado event, subsequent closure
and multi-phased reopening.

Adjusted
EBITDA is not a measurement of operating performance computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance
with GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure as it is widely used by analysts, investors and comparable companies
in the entertainment and attractions industry to evaluate our operating performance on a consistent basis, as well as more easily compare
our results with those of other companies in our industry. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of park-level operating
profitability. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our operating results and is not intended to be a substitute for operating
income, net income or cash flows from operating activities as defined under GAAP.

Contested
Proxy and Related Matters 

On
December 22, 2023, Focused Compounding Fund, LP (together with the participants in its solicitation, Focused Compounding submitted documents to the Company providing notice as to a demand that the Company hold a special meeting of
stockholders (the Special Meeting ). The Special Meeting was held for the purpose of asking stockholders to consider and
vote upon five proposals, including a proposal for the removal of all directors currently serving on the Board of Directors and a proposal
for the election of a new Board of Directors comprised entirely of Focused Compounding s slate of three candidates. The Special
Meeting was held on February 26, 2024 and Focused Compounding s proposal to reconstitute the Board of Directors received the votes
of a majority of shareholders who voted, but not a sufficient majority for approval under Nevada law, so it did not pass. 

On
March 1, 2024, Focused Compounding filed a Complaint in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County against the Company and each
of the members of our Board of Directors, alleging that the defendants were contemplating efforts to entrench themselves as members of
the Board of Directors. On June 20, 2024, Focused Compounding, the Company and the named defendants agreed to a stipulation dismissing
with prejudice any and all claims by and between the parties outlined in the initial Complaint in light of the results of the Company s
annual meeting of stockholders held on June 6, 2024. 

On
June 6, 2024 we held our annual meeting of stockholders (the 2024 Annual Meeting ). The purpose of the 2024 Annual Meeting
was for the Company s stockholders to elect seven nominees to serve on the Company s Board of Directors (the Board ),
as well as consider additional proposals. The Company and Focused Compounding each submitted proxies soliciting the Company s stockholders
to vote for their respective proposed director nominees. The nominees for director included six nominees proposed by the Company and
four nominees proposed by Focused Compounding. At the 2024 Annual Meeting, the Company s stockholders elected four nominees proposed
by Focused Compounding and three nominees proposed by the Company. 

On
June 14, 2024, the Company announced that Lisa Brady stepped down as its President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Company s
Board had appointed Geoffrey Gannon as the Company s President. Mr. Gannon is also the Portfolio Manager at Focused Compounding. 

We
engaged legal counsel specializing in activist stockholder matters, as well as several other consultants, during this proxy contest and
for the year ended September 29, 2024, we incurred 2.04 million of associated expenses, net. As of September 29, 2024, we had approximately
 982,200 of unpaid expenses associated with the contested proxy and related matters. We are working with our directors and officers insurance
carrier regarding potential insurance coverage related to the expenses associated with the contested proxy and related matters. See NOTE
3. CONTESTED PROXY AND RELATED MATTERS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information. 

Georgia
Park Severe Weather and Tornado 

For
the year ended October 1, 2023, we incurred 780,941 of Georgia Park severe weather and tornado related expenses, primarily due to
tree and other debris removal, repairing and replacing underground water pipes throughout the property, as well as general clean-up
efforts. In addition, we had tornado and severe weather-related asset write-offs of 275,297, primarily associated with damage to
various animal exhibits, several buildings, fencing and other infrastructure. These expenses and asset write-offs were partially
offset by insurance proceeds totaling 687,283, net of deductibles and co-insurance. We also estimate our Georgia park revenues for
our 2023 fiscal year were negatively impacted by approximately 1.0 million as a result of the severe weather and tornado event,
subsequent closure and multi-phased reopening. For the year ended September 29, 2024, we received the final expected insurance
proceeds of 53,755 related to the Georgia Park 2023 tornado event. See NOTE 4. TORNADO EXPENSES AND ASSET WRITE-OFFS 
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
information.

Consolidated
and Segment Results of Operations for the Year Ended September 29, 2024 as Compared to the Year Ended October 1, 2023 

We
manage our operations on an individual location basis. Discrete financial information is maintained for each park and provided to our
corporate management for review and as a basis for decision-making. The primary performance measures used to allocate resources are park
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and free cash flow. We use park earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization, and free cash flow as a measure of profitability to gauge segment performance because we believe this measure is the
most indicative of performance trends and the overall earnings potential of each segment.

Our
total revenues for the year ended September 29, 2024 were 9.91 million, an increase of 472,012, compared to the year ended October
1, 2023. Our park revenues increased by 404,761 or 4.4 and animal sales increased by 67,251. In mid-January 2024 we completed the
strategic switch to a new online ticketing platform. While this change had a net neutral impact on our profitability, we no longer directly
up-charge customer transaction fees. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the impact of our Georgia Park closure and phased reopening
that extended over roughly an eight week period during the year ended October 1, 2023, as well as the change in accounting for customer
transaction processing fees, our park revenues for the year ended September 29, 2024 decreased by approximately 470,800 or 4.6 . 

Georgia
park revenues were 5.88 million, an increase of 52,387 or 0.9 . On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the tornado damage closure and
phased reopening, as well as the change in accounting for transaction processing fees, Georgia park revenue decreased by approximately
 892,500 or 13.2 . Missouri park revenues were 2.01 million, an increase of 315,479 or 18.6 . On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the
change in accounting for transaction processing fees, Missouri park revenues increased by approximately 354,600 or 21.4 . Texas park
revenues were 1.79 million, an increase of 36,895 or 2.1 . On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the change in accounting for transaction
processing fees, Texas park revenues increased by approximately 67,200 or 3.9 . 

Segment
Income 

Our
segment income was 2.83 million for the year ended September 29, 2024, an increase of 486,062, compared to a segment income of 2.39
million for the year ended October 1, 2023. Our Georgia Park generated segment income of 2.29 million, an increase of 240,878, primarily
attributable to higher park revenues and animal sales, as well as lower advertising and general operating expenses, partially offset
by lower food service and gift shop margins, as well as higher insurance expense. Our Missouri Park generated segment income of 457,219,
an increase of 199,840, primarily attributable to higher park revenues and animal sales, as well as lower general operating costs, partially
offset by higher staffing related costs, animal feed costs, and insurance costs. Our Texas Park generated segment income of 72,921,
an increase of 45,344, primarily attributable to higher park revenues, as well as lower advertising and general operating expenses,
partially offset by higher staffing related costs, expenses associated with animal sales and insurance costs. 

13 

Corporate
Expenses 

Corporate
spending increased by 13,112 to 1.21 million for the year ended September 29, 2024, primarily due to higher severance costs and annual
stockholders meeting costs, as well as higher general expenses, partially offset by lower other compensation related expense and lower
travel costs. 

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense 

Depreciation
and amortization expense for the year ended September 29, 2024 decreased by 12,492, to 871,967, primarily attributable to lower depreciation
expense for our Missouri Park higher, partially offset by higher depreciation expense for our Georgia Park. 

Loss
on Asset Disposals, Net 

Our
net loss on asset disposals for the year ended September 29, 2024 totaled 62,734, a decrease of 254,412. Our 2024 fiscal year net loss
on asset disposals is primarily attributable to animal deaths prior to the end of their estimated life expectancy as well as the disposal
of certain assets no longer useful to the business or deemed too costly to maintain or repair. Our 2023 fiscal year net loss on asset
disposals was primarily attributable to terminated capital projects and contracts, as well as animal losses. 

Contested
Proxy and Related Matters, Net 

During
the year ended September 29, 2024, we recorded 2.04 million of net expenses associated with a contested proxy and related matters. This
includes costs associated with preparation for and conducting a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on February 26, 2024, legal costs
associated with a lawsuit filed in the State of Nevada by Focused Compounding on March 1, 2024, as well as costs leading up to and associated
with the annual stockholder meeting on June 6, 2024. These costs were partially offset by directors and officers insurance proceeds of
 50,000 received in October 2024. See NOTE 3. CONTESTED PROXY AND RELATED MATTERS of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

Tornado
Expenses and Write-offs, Net 

As
a result of the tornado and severe weather damage at our Georgia Park during March 26-27, 2023, for the year ended October 1, 2023, we
recorded 780,941 of tornado related expenses, primarily due to tree and other debris removal, repairing and replacing underground water
pipes throughout the property, as well as general clean-up and reopening efforts. In addition, we recorded tornado and severe weather-related
asset write-offs of 275,297, primarily associated with damage to various animal exhibits, several buildings, fencing and other infrastructure.
These expenses and write-offs were partially offset by 687,283 of insurance proceeds from our commercial property coverage. During year
ended September 29, 2024, we received the final expected insurance proceeds of 53,755 related to the Georgia Park 2023 tornado event. 

Legal
Settlement 

During
the year ended September 29, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement and paid 75,000 to settle a lawsuit initiated by a former
employee alleging several instances of employment discrimination. See NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

Other
Income, Net 

Other
income, net, was 132,948 for the year ended September 29, 2024, an increase of 52,718, attributable to lower non-operating expenses
and higher interest income, partially offset by lower mineral rights royalty income from our Texas Park property. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense for the year ended September 29, 2024 was 229,244, an increase of 6,848, due to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated
with our Texas Park term loan that was refinanced on September 30, 2024, partially offset by a reduction in term loan interest expense.
See NOTE 5. LONG-TERM DEBT of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information. 

14 

Income
Taxes 

For
the year ended September 29, 2024, we generated a pre-tax loss of 1.48 million and recorded a tax benefit provision of 385,316, resulting
in an effective tax rate of approximately 26.0 . For the year ended October 1, 2023, a pre-tax loss of 572,421 and recorded a tax benefit
provision of 88,683, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 15.5 , which was unfavorably impacted by state income taxes
due to operating losses for our Missouri and Texas Parks. For additional information, see N ote
 9. Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As
shown in the table above, several one-time items impacted our year-over-year reported net income comparison. Excluding the after-tax impact of these items our adjusted net income for our
2024 fiscal year increased by a net 625,227. This increase in adjusted net income is attributable to a 240,878 increase in Georgia
Park segment, a 199,840 increase in Missouri park segment income, a 45,344 increase in Texas park segment income, a 254,412 decrease
in losses on asset disposals, a 52,718 increase in other income, and a 12,492 decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, partially
offset by a 13,112 increase in Corporate expenses, a 6,848 increase in interest expense and a higher adjusted income tax expense of
 160,497. 

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Financial
Condition and Liquidity 

Our
primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements. Historically, our slow season
starts after Labor Day in September and runs until Spring Break, which typically begins toward the end of March. The first and second
quarters of our fiscal year have historically generated negative cash flow, requiring us to use cash generated from prior fiscal years,
as well as borrowing on a seasonal basis, to fund operations and prepare our parks for the busy season during the third and fourth quarters
of our fiscal year. 

Our
working capital was 1.60 million as of September 29, 2024, compared to 3.69 million as of October 1, 2023. The year-over-year decrease
in working capital primarily reflects cash used in the contested proxy and related matters, for capital expenditures, and scheduled term
loan payments, partially offset by cash generated by operating activities during our 2024 fiscal year, excluding the contested proxy
matter. 

Total
loan debt, including current maturities, as of September 29, 2024 was 3.50 million compared to 4.23 million as of October 1, 2023.
The year-over-year decrease in total loan debt is primarily the result of scheduled term loan payments during our 2024 fiscal year. 

As
of September 29, 2024, we had equity of 13.95 million and total loan debt of 3.50 million, resulting in a debt to equity ratio of 0.25
to 1.0, compared to 0.28 to 1.0 as of October 1, 2023. 

15 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash provided by operating activities was 801,456 for our 2024 fiscal year, compared to 927,478 for our 2023
fiscal year, resulting in a decrease of 126,022, primarily due to lower non-cash operating expenses and higher net loss, offset by lower
net working capital cash usage. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 1.63 million for our 2024 fiscal year, compared to 1.56 million for our 2023 fiscal year, resulting
in an increase of 70,053. Our 2024 fiscal year investing activities included 906,955 of capital expenditures, compared to 1.56 million
spent on capital expenditures during our 2023 fiscal year, a decrease of 650,889. We also made 800,000 of net investments in certificates
of deposit during our 2024 fiscal year. 

During
our 2024 fiscal year, capital expenditures at our Georgia Park included various infrastructure improvements to roadways, fencing and
sidewalks, several animal acquisitions, a walk-in freezer, and improvements to several animal habitats. We also started a restroom facility
replacement and new carnivore night house, with each project expected to be completed early in calendar 2025. During our 2023 fiscal
year, capital expenditures at our Georgia Park included various enclosure updates including the addition of a state-of-the-art ring-tailed
lemur exhibit, an aviary and walk-in budgie parrot feeding experience, the general rebuild of many areas impacted by the severe weather
and tornado event, as well as guest rental vehicle fleet and capital equipment additions. 

For
our Missouri Park, 2024 fiscal year capital expenditures included a new nature path, including a walking bridge and fish feeding experience,
a hay storage barn, as well as various vehicles and equipment to improve operations. During our 2023 fiscal year, capital expenditures
at our Missouri Park included the completion of a new otter exhibit which opened in May 2023, renovations of various animal shelters
and exhibits, and capital equipment additions. 

For
our Texas Park, 2024 fiscal year capital expenditures included an upgrade to the electrical infrastructure, completion of a keeper building
to improvement the efficiency of operations, and a hay storage barn to allow for more cost effective hay purchasing. During our 2023
fiscal year, capital expenditures at our Texas Park included several animal acquisitions, an additional drive-through zone for zebras
and camels, and several capital maintenance projects. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash used in financing activities totaled 777,986 for the year ended September 29, 2024, compared to 738,617 million for the year ended
October 1, 2023, resulting in an increase of 39,369, primarily due to scheduled principal payments on our term loans. 

Borrowing
Agreements 

On
June 18, 2021, through our wholly owned subsidiary Wild Animal Georgia, we completed a refinancing transaction (the 2021
Refinancing with Synovus Bank. The 2021 Refinancing included a term loan in the original principal amount of 1.95 million. The
2021 Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 3.75 per annum and is payable in monthly installments of approximately 26,480, based on
a seven-year amortization period. The 2021 Term Loan has a maturity date of June 18, 2028. The 2021 Term Loan is secured by a security
deed on the assets of Wild Animal Georgia. We paid a total of approximately 1,514 in fees and expenses in connection with the
2021 Refinancing. The outstanding balance of the 2021 Term Loan was 1.11 million as of September 29, 2024. 

On
April 27, 2020, through our wholly owned subsidiary Aggieland-Parks Inc., we acquired Aggieland Wild Animal Texas. In part, this
acquisition was financed with the 2020 Term Loan from First Financial Bank First Financial ). The 2020 Term
Loan in the original principal amount of 5.0 million from First Financial is secured by substantially all the Aggieland Wild Animal
 Texas assets, as well as guarantees from the Company and its subsidiaries. The 2020 Term Loan bore an interest rate of 5.0 per annum, had a maturity date of April
27, 2031, and required interest only monthly payments through April 2021. The 2020 Term Loan required monthly payments of approximately
 53,213 beginning in May 2021. We paid a total of approximately 62,375 in fees and expenses in connection with the 2020 Term Loan. On
June 30, 2021, the Company used the incremental proceeds of the 2021 Term Loan, combined with additional funds, to paydown 1.0 million
against the 2020 Term Loan, which had an outstanding balance of 2.39 million as of September 29, 2024. On September 30, 2024, the 2020
Term Loan with First Financial was fully paid off with the proceeds of the term loan described Subsequent Events . 

16 

Subsequent
Events 

On
September 30, 2024, Aggieland-Parks, Inc. completed a refinancing transaction (the 2025 Refinancing with Cendera Bank
N.A. Cendera ). The 2025 Refinancing included a term loan in the original principal amount of 2.5 million (the 2025
Term Loan). The 2025 Term Loan bears interest at a daily adjusted rate equal to the Prime Rate minus 0.5 . The Prime Rate was 8.0 as
of September 30, 2024; as such the 2025 Term Loan bears an initial interest rate of 7.5 . The 2025 Term Loan has a term of 10 years,
with a 15-year amortization, and a balloon payment of the outstanding principal balance due September 30, 2034. The initial monthly loan

established by Focused Compounding Fund, LP, with Cendera. Geoffrey Gannon and Andrew Kuhn control Focused Compounding Fund, LP, and each serve on the Board of the Company, and
Mr. Gannon is the Company s President. Focused Compounding did not receive a fee or any other benefit in connection with establishing
the above-described cash collateral reserve. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are
set forth in NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTNG POLICIES of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, which should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial position.
Our critical accounting policies are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. 

The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to long-lived assets, revenue recognition, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Although actual results historically have not deviated significantly from those determined using our estimates, our results of operations
or financial condition could differ, perhaps materially, from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Long-lived
Assets, including Property and Equipment 

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life, increase capacity or
improve the efficiency of the assets. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of property and equipment
is provided on the straight-line method and is based on the estimated useful economic lives of the respective assets. We make subjective
assessments as to these useful lives for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record annually with respect to our investments
in property and equipment. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income or loss, as a change in the estimated useful economic
lives of our investments in property and equipment would increase or decrease depreciation expense, thereby decreasing or increasing
net income or loss. We review long-lived assets whenever circumstances change such that the recorded value of an asset may not be recoverable
and therefore impaired. 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
recognize revenues when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring control of promised services or products to our customers
in an amount that reflects the amount we have received or expect to receive in exchange for those services or products. Park admission
revenues for annual passes and memberships are deferred and recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis over the term of the pass or membership.
Park admission fee revenues from advance online ticket purchases are deferred until the customers visit to the parks. Advance
online tickets can generally be used anytime during the one year period from the date of purchase. Revenues from retail and concession
sales are generally recognized upon the concurrent receipt of payment and delivery of goods to the customer. Sales taxes billed and collected
are not included in revenue. 

17 

Accounting
for Income Taxes 

We
account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement amounts and their respective tax bases using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We review our deferred tax assets to determine
whether their value can be realized based upon available evidence. A valuation allowance is established when we believe that it is more
likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

Significant
judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation
allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We record deferred tax assets, primarily resulting from net operating loss carry-forwards
to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available
evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent
results of operations. In the event we determine it is more likely than not we will not realize our deferred tax assets we establish
a valuation allowance. 

Contingencies 

We
have various contingencies, as described in NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are not aware of any other legal matters involving the Company, however, there
can be no assurance that all proceedings that may currently be brought against us are known by us at this time.

With
the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Parks! America, Inc. (the Registrant ),
the Registrant s management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures, as required
by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the fiscal year
covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the Registrant s principal executive officer and principal

(b)
Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Overview 

Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s board of
directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and includes
those policies and procedures that: 

1. 
 Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the Company; 

2. 
 Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only
 in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 

3. 
 Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the
inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis
by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce this risk. 

Management
based its assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting on criteria established in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its
assessment, management has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting are effective as of September 29, 2024. 

(c)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during our most
recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting as of September 29, 2024.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Parks! America, Inc. (the Company as of September 29, 2024
and October 1, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then
ended, and related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024 and October
1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit
of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts
or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

PARKS!
AMERICA, INC. POLICY ON INSIDER TRADING 

This
Insider Trading Policy describes the standards of Parks! America, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company on trading,
and causing the trading of, the Company s securities or securities of certain other publicly traded companies while in possession
of confidential information. This Policy is divided into two parts: the first part prohibits trading in certain circumstances and applies
to all directors, officers, and employees and their respective immediate family members of the Company and the second part imposes special
additional trading restrictions and applies to all (i) directors of the Company, (ii) executive officers of the Company (together with
the directors, Company Insiders ), (iii) the employees listed on Appendix A (collectively, Covered
Persons ). and (iv) certain other employees that the Company may designate from time to time as Covered Persons 
because of their position, responsibilities or their actual or potential access to material information. 

One
of the principal purposes of the federal securities laws is to prohibit so-called insider trading. Simply stated, insider
trading occurs when a person uses material nonpublic information obtained through involvement with the Company to make decisions to purchase,
sell, give away or otherwise trade the Company s securities or the securities of certain other companies or to provide that information
to others outside the Company. The prohibitions against insider trading apply to trades, tips and recommendations by virtually any person,
including all persons associated with the Company, if the information involved is material and nonpublic. 
These terms are defined in this Policy under Part I, Section 3 below. The prohibitions would apply to any director, officer or employee
who buys or sells securities on the basis of material nonpublic information that he or she obtained about the Company, its customers,
suppliers, partners, competitors or other companies with which the Company has contractual relationships or may be negotiating transactions. 

PART
I 

1.
Applicability; Individual Responsibility. 

This
Policy applies to all trading or other transactions in (i) the Company s securities, including common stock, options and any other
securities that the Company may issue, such as preferred stock, notes, bonds and convertible securities, as well as to derivative securities
relating to any of the Company s securities, whether or not issued by the Company and (ii) the securities of certain other companies,
including common stock, options and other securities issued by those companies as well as derivative securities relating to any of those
companies securities. This Policy applies to all employees of the Company, all officers of the Company and all members of the
Company s board of directors and their respective family members. 

EVERY
OFFICER, DIRECTOR AND EMPLOYEE, HAS THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPLY WITH THIS POLICY, AND THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF THEIR JURISDICTION.
YOU MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, HAVE TO FOREGO A PROPOSED TRANSACTION IN THE COMPANY S SECURITIES EVEN IF YOU PLANNED TO MAKE THE TRANSACTION
BEFORE LEARNING OF THE MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION AND EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY SUFFER AN ECONOMIC LOSS OR FOREGO ANTICIPATED PROFIT BY
WAITING. TRADING IN THE COMPANY S SECURITIES DURING THE TRADING WINDOW DESCRIBED HEREIN SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SAFE
HARBOR, AND YOU SHOULD USE GOOD JUDGMENT AT ALL TIMES 

2.
General Policy: No Trading or Causing Trading While in Possession of Material Nonpublic Information. 

(a)
 No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family members may purchase or sell, or offer to purchase or sell, any
Company security, whether or not issued by the Company, while in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company. (The
terms material and nonpublic are defined in Part I, Section 3(a) and (b) below.) 

(b)
 No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family members who knows of any material nonpublic information about the
Company may communicate that information to tip any other person, including family members and friends, or otherwise
disclose such information without the Company s authorization. 

(c)
 No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family members may purchase or sell any security of any other publicly-traded
company while in possession of material nonpublic information that was obtained in the course of his or her involvement with the Company.
No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family member who knows of any such material nonpublic information may communicate
that information to, or tip, any other person, including family members and friends, or otherwise disclose such information without the
Company s authorization. 

(d)
 For compliance purposes, you should never trade, tip or recommend securities (or otherwise cause the purchase or sale of securities)
while in possession of information that you have reason to believe is material and nonpublic unless you first consult with, and obtain
the advance approval of, the Compliance Officer (which is defined in Part I, Section 3(c) below). 

(e)
 Covered Persons must pre-clear all trading in securities of the Company in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Part II, Section 3 below. 

3.
Definitions. 

(a)
Material. Insider trading restrictions come into play only if the information you possess is material. Materiality,
however, involves a relatively low threshold. Information is generally regarded as material if it has market significance,
that is, if its public dissemination is likely to affect the market price of securities, or if it otherwise is information that a reasonable
investor would want to know before making an investment decision. 

Examples
of material information include (but are not limited to) information about corporate earnings or earnings forecasts; possible mergers,
acquisitions, tender offers or dispositions; important business developments, such as entry into or loss of significant contracts; management
or control changes; significant financing developments including pending public sales or offerings of debt or equity securities; defaults
on borrowings; bankruptcies; and significant litigation or regulatory actions. Moreover, material information does not have to be related
to a company s business. For example, the contents of a forthcoming newspaper column that is expected to affect the market price
of a security can be material. When in doubt about whether particular nonpublic information is material, you should presume it is material.
 If you are unsure whether information is material, you should either consult the Compliance Officer before making any decision to
disclose such information (other than to persons who need to know it) or to trade in or recommend securities to which that information
relates or assume that the information is material. 

2 

(b)
Nonpublic. Insider trading prohibitions come into play only when you possess information that is material and nonpublic. 
The fact that information has been disclosed to a few members of the public does not make it public for insider trading purposes. To
be public the information must have been disseminated in a manner designed to reach investors generally, and the investors
must be given the opportunity to absorb the information. Even after public disclosure of information about the Company, you must wait
until the close of business on the second trading day after the information was publicly disclosed before you can treat the information
as public. 

Nonpublic
information may include: information available to a select group of analysts or brokers or institutional investors; undisclosed facts
that are the subject of rumors, even if the rumors are widely circulated; and information that has been entrusted to the Company on a
confidential basis until a public announcement of the information has been made and enough time has elapsed for the market to respond
to a public announcement of the information (normally two trading days). 

As
with questions of materiality, if you are not sure whether information is considered public, you should either consult with the Compliance
Officer or assume that the information is nonpublic and treat it as confidential. 

(c)
Compliance Officer. The Company has appointed the Chief Financial Officer as the Compliance Officer for this Policy. The duties
of the Compliance Officer include, but are not limited to, the following: assisting with implementation and enforcement of this Policy;
circulating this Policy to all employees and ensuring that this Policy is amended as necessary to remain up-to-date with insider trading
laws; pre-clearing all trading in securities of the Company by Covered Persons in accordance with the procedures set forth in Part II,
Section 3 below; providing approval of any Rule 10b5-1 plans under Part II, Section 1(c) below and any prohibited transactions under
Part II, Section 4 below. providing a reporting system with an effective whistleblower protection mechanism. 

4.
Exceptions. 

The
trading restrictions of this Policy do not apply to the following: 

(a)
401(k) Plan. Investing 401(k) plan contributions in a Company stock fund in accordance with the terms of the Company s
401(k) plan, if any. However, any changes in your investment election regarding the Company s stock are subject to trading restrictions
under this Policy. 

(b)
Options. Exercising stock options granted under the Company s under the Company s Stock Option Plan for cash or the
delivery of previously owned Company stock. However, the sale of any shares issued on the exercise of Company-granted stock options and
any cashless exercise of Company-granted stock options are subject to trading restrictions under this Policy. 

(c)
Gifts. Bona fide gifts of the Company s securities. 

3 

5.
Violations of Insider Trading Laws. 

Penalties
for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information can be severe, both for individuals involved in such unlawful conduct
and their employers and supervisors, and may include jail terms, criminal fines, civil penalties and civil enforcement injunctions. Given
the severity of the potential penalties, compliance with this Policy is absolutely mandatory. 

(a)
Legal Penalties. A person who violates insider trading laws by engaging in transactions in a company s securities when
he or she has material nonpublic information can be sentenced to a substantial jail term and required to pay a criminal penalty of several
times the amount of profits gained or losses avoided. In addition, a person who tips others may also be liable for transactions by the
tippees to whom he or she has disclosed material nonpublic information. Tippers can be subject to the same penalties and sanctions as
the tippees, and the SEC has imposed large penalties even when the tipper did not profit from the transaction. 

The
SEC can also seek substantial civil penalties from any person who, at the time of an insider trading violation, directly or indirectly
controlled the person who committed such violation, which would apply to the Company and/or management and supervisory personnel.
These control persons may be held liable for up to the greater of 1 million or three times the amount of the profits gained or losses
avoided. Even for violations that result in a small or no profit, the SEC can seek penalties from a company and/or its management and
supervisory personnel as control persons. 

(b)
Company-Imposed Penalties. Employees who violate this Policy may be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, including
dismissal for cause. Any exceptions to the Policy, if permitted, may only be granted by the Compliance Officer and must be provided before
any activity contrary to the above requirements takes place. 

6.
Inquiries. 

If
you have any questions regarding any of the provisions of this Policy, please contact the Compliance Officer at Todd White at todd.white@animalsafari.com. 

PART
II 

 1.
Blackout Periods. 

All
Covered Persons are prohibited from trading in the Company s securities during blackout periods as defined below. 

(a)
Quarterly Blackout Periods. Trading in the Company s securities is prohibited during the period beginning at the close
of the market on two weeks before the end of each fiscal quarter and ending at the close of business on the second trading day following
the date the Company s financial results are publicly disclosed and Form 10-Q or Form 10-K is filed. During these periods, Covered
Persons generally possess or are presumed to possess material nonpublic information about the Company s financial results. 

(b)
Other Blackout Periods. From time to time, other types of material nonpublic information regarding the Company (such as negotiation
of mergers, acquisitions or dispositions, investigation and assessment of cybersecurity incidents or new product developments) may be
pending and not be publicly disclosed. While such material nonpublic information is pending, the Company may impose special blackout
periods during which Covered Persons are prohibited from trading in the Company s securities. If the Company imposes a special
blackout period, it will notify the Covered Persons affected. 

4 

(c)
Exception. These trading restrictions do not apply to transactions under a pre-existing written plan, contract, instruction,
or arrangement under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (an Approved 10b5-1 Plan that: 

(i)
has been reviewed and approved at least one month in advance of any trades thereunder by the Compliance Officer (or, if revised or amended,
such revisions or amendments have been reviewed and approved by the Compliance Officer at least on month in advance of any subsequent
trades); 

(ii)
was entered into in good faith by the Covered Person at a time when the Covered Person was not in possession of material nonpublic information
about the Company; and 

(iii)
gives a third party the discretionary authority to execute such purchases and sales, outside the control of the Covered Person, so long
as such third party does not possess any material nonpublic information about the Company; or explicitly specifies the security or securities
to be purchased or sold, the number of shares, the prices and/or dates of transactions, or other formula(s) describing such transactions. 

2.
Trading Window. 

Covered
Persons are permitted to trade in the Company s securities when no blackout period is in effect. Generally, this means that Covered
Persons can trade during the period beginning on the close of business on the second trading day following the date the Company s
financial results are publicly disclosed and Form 10-Q or Form 10-K is filed and ending on the close of the market on two weeks before
the end of each fiscal quarter. However, even during this trading window, a Covered Person who is in possession of any material nonpublic
information should not trade in the Company s securities until the information has been made publicly available or is no longer
material. In addition, the Company may close this trading window if a special blackout period under Part II, Section 1(b) above is imposed
and will re-open the trading window once the special blackout period has ended. 

3.
Pre-Clearance of Securities Transactions. 

(a)
 Because Company Insiders are likely to obtain material nonpublic information on a regular basis, the Company requires all such persons
to refrain from trading, even during a trading window under Part II, Section 2 above, without first pre-clearing all transactions in
the Company s securities. 

(b)
 Subject to the exemption in subsection (d) below, no Company Insider may, directly or indirectly, purchase or sell (or otherwise
make any transfer, gift, pledge or loan of) any Company security at any time without first obtaining prior approval from the Compliance
Officer. These procedures also apply to transactions by such person s spouse, other persons living in such person s household
and minor children and to transactions by entities over which such person exercises control. 

(c)
 The Compliance Officer shall record the date each request is received and the date and time each request is approved or disapproved.
Unless revoked, a grant of permission will normally remain valid until the close of trading two business days following the day on which
it was granted. If the transaction does not occur during the two-day period, pre-clearance of the transaction must be re-requested. 

(d)
 Pre-clearance is not required for purchases and sales of securities under an Approved 10b5-1 Plan. With respect to any purchase or
sale under an Approved 10b5-1 Plan, the third party effecting transactions on behalf of the Company Insider should be instructed to send
duplicate confirmations of all such transactions to the Compliance Officer. 

5 

4.
Prohibited Transactions. 

(a)
 Company Insiders are prohibited from trading in the Company s equity securities during a blackout period imposed under an individual
account retirement or pension plan of the Company, during which at least 50 of the plan participants are unable to purchase,
sell or otherwise acquire or transfer an interest in equity securities of the Company, due to a temporary suspension of trading by the
Company or the plan fiduciary. 

(b)
 Covered Persons, including any person s spouse, other persons living in such person s household and minor children and
entities over which such person exercises control, are prohibited from engaging in the following transactions in the Company s
securities unless advance approval is obtained from the Compliance Officer: 

(i)
Short-term trading. Company Insiders who purchase Company securities may not sell any Company securities of the same class for at
least six months after the purchase; 

(ii)
Short sales. Company Insiders and Covered Persons may not sell the Company s securities short; 

(iii)
Options trading. Covered Persons may not buy or sell puts or calls or other derivative securities on the 

 Company s
securities; 

(iv)
Trading on margin or pledging. Covered Persons may not hold Company securities in a margin account or pledge Company securities as
collateral for a loan; and 

(v)
Hedging. Covered Persons may not enter into hedging or monetization transactions or similar arrangements with respect to Company
securities. 

5.
Limitation of Liability. 

None
of the Company, the Compliance Officer or the Company s other employees will have any liability for any delay in reviewing, or
refusal of, a 10b5-1 trading plan submitted pursuant to this Policy or a request for pre-clearance submitted pursuant to Part II, Section
3 of this Policy. Notwithstanding any review of a 10b5-1 trading plan or pre-clearance of a transaction pursuant to Section Part II,
Section 3 of this Policy, none of the Company, the Compliance Officer or the Company s other employees assumes any liability for
the legality or consequences of such 10b5-1 trading plan or transaction to the person engaging in or adopting such 10b5-1 trading plan
or transaction
